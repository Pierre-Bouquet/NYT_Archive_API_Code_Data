President Lincoln's Reelection a Quietus,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/01/archives/not-the-time-to-surrender.html,President Lincoln's Reelection a Quietus,"Shall rebellion be allowed to triumph in its last throes? Are we, who bore down upon it so effectively in its towering might, no[???] [???]o give way before it when it staggers in [???]kness? We do not need the evidence in JEFF. DAVIS' late speeches, or the testimony of the fugitives who are coming into our lines in constantly increasing numbers, to know that the tremendous drain of the last three years upon the resources of the Southern people is at last near its uttermost limit. In the nature of things it could not be otherwise. The census returns of 1860 presented the exact extent of these resources, particularly in respect to able-bodied population, the main element in war. They show that at that time there were only about a million and a quarter of white men between sixteen and fifty in all the eleven States which went into the ""Confederacy."" Not more than two-thirds of these, at the very most, could have been physically able to stand effective military service. We have lost by disease and battle about half a million since the war began. They, in the want of sanitary commissions, and of medical necessities, and by being oftener worsted in fight than we have been, have lost at least as many. There are then but about three hundred thousand left fit for military duty, in all these eleven States. But at least half of the area of these States has been so much reduced to our control as to be unavailable to the rebel government for conscription. Considering this, in connection with the fact that we have between sixty and seventy thousand of the rebel army in our hands as prisoners of war, it is mathematically certain that the rebellion is fast finding it an absolute impossibility to keep up its armies to the strength indispensable for its making any effective stand against us.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Not the Time to Surrender.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Not the Time to Surrender.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6fcfa9d2-3f21-5827-b4ac-fb1c86d09781,1016,nyt://article/6fcfa9d2-3f21-5827-b4ac-fb1c86d09781,

As they are often gentlemen of much culture, who know from long reading the fearful effects of the system of human slavery in all lands where it has been tried, and as personally they have sacrificed fortune and country for liberty, we think the last point of the accusation is probably true. They undoubtedly can appreciate what liberty means, better than many of our native Americans, and they do unquestionably hate slavery, as men should, who have suffered under oppression all their lives. They were too intelligent to be deceived by the word ""Democrat,"" as some of their ignorant countrymen, and they naturally joined the progressive and truly Republican party of this country. Their support of the Union party is all the more acceptable, because, as the Zeitung truly observes, many of them personally preferred Gen.

Estimate of Political Standing; Magazines for November,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/02/archives/the-magazines.html,Estimate of Political Standing; Magazines for November,"-- Harper's New Monthly Magazine (New-York: HARPER & BROTHERS) for November, opens with ROSS BROWNE's second paper on Arizona, and his adventures in the arid regions watered by the River Gila. It is profusely illustrated with clear sketches, and forms an article of great interest on a part of the world on which there is scarcely anything ""in print"" at present. ""A Cruise on the Sassacus"" describes vividly the excitements of chasing blockade-runners, and overhauling the ""assorted cargoes"" intended to minister to the wants of the Confederates, but transformed by the fortunes of war into prizes of no ordinary value. ""Exploring the Magalloway,"" is a pleasant account of border rambles on the confines of Maine and Canada. ""Ups and Downs"" contains some curious episodes of family history, founded on the very questionable authority of BURKE, the Peerage Editor, a most blundering and incompetent successor to the DUGDALES and CAMDENE of old, who once dignified the study of genealogy. ""An Unfortunate Princess,"" epitomises WREXALL'S lately published memoir of CAROLINE MATILDA, the ill-fated sister of GEORGE III., and Queen of Denmark. ""The Decline of Tragedy "" and ""Woman's Profession Dishonored,"" complete the list of miscellaneous prose articles. Fiction is headed, of course, by DICKENS' Story, ""Our Mutual Friend,"" now in its fifth month. Two or three new characters are added to the already crowded canvas. One of them, ""Mr. Headstone,"" the official schoolmaster, testifies strongly to the author's impatience of the line and rule systems that would reduce all nature to the monotony of a ""cut and dry"" plan; the other, ""Miss Jenny,"" the doll's dressmaker, is a slightly fantastic creature, redeemed from unreality by the author's genial humor, which is not incompatible with touches of genuine pathos. ""My Refugees,"" is a story of the Southern War. ""The Crow Child,"" ""My Silver Spoon,"" and ""On the Way to the Diamond Mines,"" are of a mere imaginative complexion. The ""Monthly Record,"" ""Literary Notices,"" ""Editor's Table,"" &c., are prepared with the usual care that has always been conspicuous in the various departments of Harper's Monthly.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2fc1a08d-9c45-585b-8d21-545300b1d63b,1349,nyt://article/2fc1a08d-9c45-585b-8d21-545300b1d63b,

The vessel left Mr. WESTERVELT's yard about 10 A.M., and proceeded down the river, ""heaving-to"" off the Battery to receive on board T.B. STILLMAN, Esq., Superintendent of Repairs and Supplies; Captains CONSTABLE, MERRIAM and MARSELLS. United States Revenue Marine; Mr. HOPPER WHITE and others. After 11 o'clock the Kankakee steamed down the bay, gradually increasing her speed until it reached about 12 knots per hour, the engines making as high as 36 revolutions per minute, and the screw turning 108 times per minute. Steam was at 22 pounds pressure, vacuum 27 1/2 inches, the cut-off following 12 inches out of 30 inches, or working steam expansively 18 inches. She has one tubular boiler. Her engines are oscillating, geared three one on the shaft; the cylinders are 36 inches in diameter, with 30 inches stroke, and were built by J. & R.J. GRAY, at the Phoenix Iron Works, in this city. The screw is 8 feet in diameter, with 12 feet pitch. The hull was built by WESTERVELT & SON, and is of the following dimensions: Length, 130 feet; beam, 26 feet; depth, 11 feet 6 inches. She is brig rigged and makes a very fine appearance upon the water. She steers beautifully, turning around in a very short space. She carries an armament of six guns, two of them being pivots. The after one is a 30-pounder Parrott, while all of the other guns are of the Dahlgren pattern. About 4 o'clock, after returning from a trip down the bay, Collector DRAPER came on board, and the Kankakee again steamed down the bay. The Collector was very much pleased with the vessel, and all the inspecting officers pronounced unqualifiedly in favor of this new craft. She will no doubt prove a valuable acquisition to the revenue-cutter service.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naval News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Naval News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6dbf1dc1-c7f8-5b03-ad2e-973216315af7,1068,nyt://article/6dbf1dc1-c7f8-5b03-ad2e-973216315af7,

How many pirates came on board? How was it that they were picked up as ordinary passengers, boarding the Roanoke, as they did half way down the harbor of Havana? ""On getting half way out the harbor,"" says the purser, ""the steamer was hailed by three boats containing passengers, among them Lieut. BRAINE."" We seek for information. Is it usual for the Havana steamers thus to make good their complement of passengers? Is it usual, especially, for merchant steamers flying the flag of the United States, and crossing the ordinary track of the pirates, thus to fill up with boats' loads of passengers wherever they are hailed? It seems to us that this statement of the extraordinary manner in which the pirates got on board the Roanoke ought to lead to an examination of the truth of the report current at the time of the capture -- that it was talked about, and anticipated in Havana, before the Roanoke weighed anchor.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CAPTURE OF THE ROANOKE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CAPTURE OF THE ROANOKE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/88e2f947-dc06-556c-9f0b-16cec826e6e0,199,nyt://article/88e2f947-dc06-556c-9f0b-16cec826e6e0,

They are attempting to prove that GRANT made a final and fatal failure; to show by it that GRANT can never capture Richmond, and that the great rebellion can never be subdued. The Copperheads have rushed to these conclusions with the greatest haste and the utmost delight. But the fact is they are altogether overdoing this thing. The malignancy with which they seize on every incident to belittle and misrepresent the deeds of our armies, and to show the hopelessness of the Union cause, is producing disgust among all decent white men. They have neither pride in their country, pride in the achievement of its armies, nor self-respect. When they cannot daily find grounds ready at hand for maligning our soldiers, they invent false grounds.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LATE BATTLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LATE BATTLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a3815de-fdde-5ac0-b60c-bd5de16ffd93,184,nyt://article/2a3815de-fdde-5ac0-b60c-bd5de16ffd93,

And as I made the match to fight in Ireland on Oct. 4, how could he fight when he left Ireland the night before with his tall between his legs? Furthermore the stakeholder did not send the ropes and slakes belonging to the association, although the expenses were to have been borne alike. As for my not training, that would have been all in his favor; but I can assure MACE that I was trained enough to have met him, had he the courage to face me, and I have no doubt as to the battle resulting in my favor. I offered to give MACE £200 to fight me on British ground in America, but he had'nt the pluck to accept; and, to stop his bouncing challenges to the world, I agreed to take £100 and fight him in Ireland. He now backs out of his own proposition, and wants to gull me into fighting in England by the promise of an additional £100, to which I do not see fit to agree; but, providing I get the stakes, to which I consider myself justly entitled according to the rules of the ring, as MACE never showed on the ground, or even in the county, I will make a fresh match with MACE, and give him £300 to fight me in any part of the Queen's dominions in America, for £1,000 a side. To show how earnest I was in my intentions, I remained up to the end of the week in Ireland, and offered to give him the choice of ground there, but my friends and the public must be quite satisfied that he never meant to fight me at all, unless he could have the battle come off in England. To stop this letter-writing, I wish him and all his school to understand that I shall not fight in England under any circumstances. Had MACE been at the ringside and I not there, it requires no foresight to tell who would have got the money; and I therefore claim the stakes to which I am entitled.""

Cortina's Surrender and the Chicago Surrender,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/03/archives/cortinas-and-the-copperheads.html,Cortina's Surrender and the Chicago Surrender,"We publish this morning CORTINAS' declaration of surrender to the French commander at Matamoras. It will strike every intelligent Copperhead at once, how remarkable is the coincidence in spirit and in terms between this offer of surrender by CORTINAS, and the proposed Chicago surrender to JEFF. DAVIS. CORTINAS, like MCCLELLAN's supporters, considers the struggle of Mexico for nationality ""a failure,"" and certainly, we must admit that, though his action in this respect is not of the heroic order, he has infinitely more reason for it than our Copperheads. He relies upon the statements, official and unofficial, of the French invaders, that they only mean kindness and good-will to the Mexican people, just as the Chicago Cessationists rely upon JEFF. DAVIS, that, after all, he only means Union. CORTINAS looks to the Commander of the French for ""magnanimity.""

The gallantry, presence of mind, coolness and daring of Lieut. CUSHING have had few parallels in our own or any other time. His craft was little better than a ship's launch. His crew consisted of but a dozen men. The obstacles which presented themselves in ascending the Roanoke were of a kind only to be overcome by exertions of an almost superhuman nature. But the task was accomplished, as our readers will see, in a way which must command the admiration of the whole country, although at some sacrifice; only two of the party -- Lieut. CUSHING and one of his men -- escaping either death or capture. We question if the record of any navy can produce a case of more noble and indomitable daring than is to be found in this recital.

CUSHING not being more than 22 years of age.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DESTRUCTION OF THE REBEL RAM ALBEMARLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DESTRUCTION OF THE REBEL RAM ALBEMARLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/74843566-f8fa-5814-ac1a-5500cc6a7fef,179,nyt://article/74843566-f8fa-5814-ac1a-5500cc6a7fef,

The movement was in the hands of men who were of the highest repute, and their position in the Democratic party in other and better days was such as to give them, now as well as then, a large popular control. The Copperheads have undertaken to abuse these men personally and malignantly. They vituperate them as they vituperate all who are not on the side of JEFF. DAVIS. They attack them as ferociously as they assail the President and Generals of the Union. But it has little effect on the intelligent men who were members of the old Democratic party. They see the absurdity of the foul assaults, in the name of Democracy, upon men like CUTTING, DIX, WEBB, STEWART, ROOSEVELT, TAYLOR, WHITING and CODDINGTON, by Copperhead malignants and factious fag-ends.

Even yet they hope to be able to use it to a large extent. This they expect to do mainly in the large cities of the North. Notwithstanding the exposure of the gigantic and outrageous army fraud, and notwithstanding the startling effect it has had upon the country, the more reckless and unscrupulous Copperheads are still determined that they shall not be baulked in their nefarious scheme of thwarting the popular will by fraudulent votes. Their scheme, as the evidence before the court-military has shown, was carefully planned, adroitly managed, and came very near to a successful consummation at the first effort. It went so far that it is feared it will even yet be difficult to prevent thousands of manufactured votes from getting into the ballot-boxes of this and other cities. This State, at all events, they are determined to carry by any means, however infamous -- though the shrewder of them have now given up all hope of carrying the country and electing their Presidential candidate.

Maximilian and his Patron,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/06/archives/maximilian-and-his-patron.html,Maximilian and his Patron,"Almost every other mail brings us ominous intelligence about the Mexican Emporer. At one time it is reported that he is at daggers drawn with the Mexican Priesthood; next comes, the rumor that MIRAMON has seized half his Capital; and now we have an item from Havana, which sets forth that NAPOLEON is so exasperated against Austria, on account of her conduct toward Denmark, that he has made up his mind to withdraw all his soldiers from Mexico, and abandon MAXIMILIAN to his fate. This comes from what may be regarded as a Spanish source, and is not entitled to implicit confidence, since Spaniards and Cubans would exult at the collapse of the Franco-Mexican Monarchy, and would be delighted to lend a hand, if they dared, to tumble it down. But if the intelligence proves authentic, it will be the worst news for poor MAXIMILIAN that has yet got vent. Of course it is well known that a division of the Franco-Mexican army is under orders for home, and it is equally well known that it has long been the intention of the French Emperor to withdraw the entire French force, the moment his protege shall have organized a mercenary army adequate to the defence of his throne. Recalling all the French soldiers instanter, however, without allowing MAXIMILIAN time to recruit an army, is a very different matter, and would be the death-warrant of the new Emperor and the new Empire. The throne of the Hapsburg has no root in Mexican soil. It is an exotic, which all classes and factions regard with dislike, and, when once the French disappear, churchmen and laics will come forward with equal alacrity to compete with each other in tearing it to pieces. If MAXIMILIAN were wise, he would divest himself of crown, purple and sceptre, pack up his imperial paraphernalia, and hie back to Europe with the departing auxiliaries. For if he remain long enough he may chance to fall a victim to the popular fury.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Maximilian and his Patron.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Maximilian and his Patron.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/40ab7569-864f-559b-a47f-97576bbada2b,509,nyt://article/40ab7569-864f-559b-a47f-97576bbada2b,

This statement is enough to awaken a very painful apprehension everywhere, for no one knows where the fraudulent ballots may make their appearance.

"JOSEPH J. BINGHAM, editor of the State Sentinel, and Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee; a Third Degree member and a Grand Councilor of the Sons of Liberty, testified before the Military Commission Oct. 28. as follows: I joined the American Knights in October or November, 1863, at Military Hall, then leased to the Democratic Club of this city. I was initiated then. Dodd, Harrison, M. Jacobs, Dr. Johnson, Vandegrift, and others were present. In August or September I was introduced to P.C. WRIGHT by DODD. WRIGHT gave his history and claimed to have found in the papers belonging to Gen. GAINES, of New-Orleans, the records of a secret society which existed during the Revolutionary war, of which Gen. LEE was President, and MADISON, JEFFERSON and WASHINTON were members. WRIGHT designed to establish a similar order, and had come to this State for that purpose. He said it existed in Missouri, Illinois and the Central American States and was to extend all over the world. He wanted BINGHAM to help him found it here, but he declined because he was opposed to secret societies. He asked other leaders to join. Most of them declined. It was understood that DODD was to be a member. DODD was an active leading Know-Nothing. DODD urged BINGHAM to join, and said it was political and educational. A State University, to inculcate sound political doctrine, and a newspaper were to be started. DODD said he wanted to advise with the witness about many things. He could not, unless he joined the order; that he could not even tell the names of the members of the order, for the obligation bound him to such secresy. He offered to put BINGHAM through informally. BINGHAM saw the seeds of discord for the party, if he did not join and unite the different elements against the Administration. DODD informed BINGHAM that he was a delegate to the State Council of November, 1853. He attended and took the Grand Council Degree. DODD presided. He was present but an hour, when he retired, and wrote his report, advising the postponement of the paper until funds were raised to support it a year, and the indefinite postponement of the University scheme. Dr. BRYANT and CUSHMAN were on the committee; he told CUSHMAN he could not stay, and got him to read the report; did not hear of any military appointments then nor until after the exposure of the sons of Liberty; he was notified by DODD to attend the Grand Council of Feb. 16; was in twice that day; heard CONKLIN, one of the Major-Generals, speaking; he was called on for a report, and replied that he had not drilled anybody, and had nobody to drill; it was his first idea that it was a military organization. BINGHAM said that he thought no good would come from the order, and HEFFREN coincided with him and said it was a humbug. He concluded not to belong to the organization; paid his fees and asked DODD if any formal withdrawal was necessary. DODD said he could withdraw when he liked. He didn't consider himself a member after that, though his having been in the Order gave him the confidence of the members, and he had learned many things he otherwise would not have known. Heard that DODD delivered an address on the 16th of February. At that meeting Dr. Bowling, Dr. Bryant, Mr. Blake, of Terre Haute, Mr. Cushman and Squire McBride, of Evansville, were present: also, Heffren. His next connection with the members of the Order was with Dodd, Bowles, Judge Bullitt, of Kentucky, and a Mr. Barrett, of Missouri, who met at his office. He supposed they were all members of the Order. Judge Bullitt invited him down to the Palmer House to take whisky. On the 2d or 3d day of August DODD called on him to issue, as chairman of the Democratic Central Committee, a call for a mass meeting on the 16th of August. He asked his word of honor that he would not reveal anything he might say. BINGHAM furnished it. DODD said a revolution had been determined on at the council of the 16th, held at Chicago, which consisted of four members from Indiana, four from Missouri, four from Illinois, and four from Kentucky, DODD, BOWLES and BULLITT were present. DODD said they arranged there to release the rebel prisoners at Johnson's Island, Camp Chase, Ohio, Camp Morton, Indiana and Camp Douglas, Illinois, and the released prisoners at Camp Douglas were to release those at ROCK Island. At the same time they were to rise in Louisville and seize the Government stores and property. BINGHAM was astonished. DODD wanted a mass meeting called, under pretense of opposing the draft, and instructing the Chicago delegates. BINGHAM refused. DODD wanted him to call a Congressional Convention to nominate a Congressman, as a cover for his revolution. BINGHAM refused. DODD went to MCDONALD to have him influence BINGHAM to call the convention. BINGHAM thought he ought to reverse the plot, and tried MCDONALD with the watchword, ""What success,"" to know whether the secret had been intrusted to him. He found it had not, and imparted it to MCDONALD on Aug. 4. They could not determine what to do, and agreed to meet again. Next day, while going home, he met MCDONALD KERR, of New-Albany, and said, ""What success."" He answered, ""Do you know anything? The people are all alarmed in our part of the State, in Washington, Harrison and Floyd counties, with the idea that a revolution is in progress. They are selling their crops because they think greenbacks safer."" KERR went on and revealed DODD's scheme. Both then went to MCDONALD's. KERR told him his plot. BINGHAM did not then tell MCDONALD of his withdrawal from the Order, but was understood to still belong. KERR's information involved Dr. ANTHON. MORTON was to be put out of the way, and ANTHON to be Governor. They went to ANTHON's house, called him up, and he denied any knowledge of the plot. They met at MCDONALD's [???] morning, and invited prominent, Democrats to [???] them. McDonald, Judge A.L. Roache, Wm. H[???]son, Aqulila Jones, Samuel H. Buskorne, Jos. R[???], Dr. Yeagle, Col. Calllwell and others were there. KERR told his story. They said the revolution must be stopped. DODD and JOHN C. WALKER were called in. They did not then acknowledge anything about it. At first KERR told BINGHAM that if they would not abandon it, it was his interest to inform the authorities and have been arrested. DODD and WALKER then spoke very earnestly about public affairs, saying the Government could not be restored under the old state of things, and nothing would save it but a forcible revolution. An appeal to the ballot-box was futile; the people would resist the draft, and they ought to direct the revolution, rather than let it direct them. DODD and WALKER promised to stop it, and it was understood they sent such orders to the various counties. BINGHAM didn't inform the authorities, because he thought they knew it, because it was agreed that notice of the uprising should be given by publishing a barbecue near Louisville. The revolution was to take place the day after the barbecue. KERR said BULLITT and other prominent members of the order were arrested because of that notice, and that many left the State for Canada. BINGHAM thought this so important, that he called the Democratic Central Committee together Aug. 13, to consult on its effect on the party. Another reason why he did not inform the authorities was, because he didn't wish to injure his party in the coming election. There was danger of that, if the revolution was made public. DODD was here for two weeks and WALKER for ten days. He told them they would be arrested, and they left. DODD claimed that the scheme was true until KERR charged it upon him. At the two days' meeting of the Central Committee, Aug. 12, this revolutionary plot was discussed. They said the plot must be dropped. WALKER was called to that meeting, and assured the Committee that it was stopped, Aug. 11. WALKER told BINGHAM he must be at the Bates House to meet the rebel officers from Louisville, who were to consult him while en route to Chicago to release the rebel prisoners there, and notify them that the revolution was postponed. In August, about the time the arms were found in DODD's building, a messenger brought him a communication from DODD and WALKER, then in Chicago, professing to be addressed to the Committee of Thirteen, asking its publication in the Sentinel. He examined it, and refused to publish it. They proposed to publish it at DODD's office, but BINGHAM having an interest, said they should not publish it, and sent it back to WALKER, who said he wrote the address, and signed DODD's name as Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen. DODD was Grand-Commander. The men were sworn to obey him implicitly in this revolution. DODD expected assistance from members of the Order who came up to the mass meeting of Aug. 16, BINGHAM said no inducements or threats had drawn out this testimony. It was voluntary.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/06/archives/remarkable-testimony-by-jj-bingham-chairman-of-the-democratic-state.html,,"JOSEPH J.

He found it had not, and imparted it to MCDONALD on Aug. 4. They could not determine what to do, and agreed to meet again. Next day, while going home, he met MCDONALD KERR, of New-Albany, and said, ""What success."" He answered, ""Do you know anything? The people are all alarmed in our part of the State, in Washington, Harrison and Floyd counties, with the idea that a revolution is in progress. They are selling their crops because they think greenbacks safer."" KERR went on and revealed DODD's scheme. Both then went to MCDONALD's. KERR told him his plot. BINGHAM did not then tell MCDONALD of his withdrawal from the Order, but was understood to still belong. KERR's information involved Dr. ANTHON. MORTON was to be put out of the way, and ANTHON to be Governor. They went to ANTHON's house, called him up, and he denied any knowledge of the plot. They met at MCDONALD's [???] morning, and invited prominent, Democrats to [???] them. McDonald, Judge A.L. Roache, Wm. H[???]son, Aqulila Jones, Samuel H. Buskorne, Jos. R[???], Dr. Yeagle, Col. Calllwell and others were there. KERR told his story. They said the revolution must be stopped. DODD and JOHN C. WALKER were called in. They did not then acknowledge anything about it. At first KERR told BINGHAM that if they would not abandon it, it was his interest to inform the authorities and have been arrested. DODD and WALKER then spoke very earnestly about public affairs, saying the Government could not be restored under the old state of things, and nothing would save it but a forcible revolution. An appeal to the ballot-box was futile; the people would resist the draft, and they ought to direct the revolution, rather than let it direct them. DODD and WALKER promised to stop it, and it was understood they sent such orders to the various counties. BINGHAM didn't inform the authorities, because he thought they knew it, because it was agreed that notice of the uprising should be given by publishing a barbecue near Louisville. The revolution was to take place the day after the barbecue. KERR said BULLITT and other prominent members of the order were arrested because of that notice, and that many left the State for Canada. BINGHAM thought this so important, that he called the Democratic Central Committee together Aug. 13, to consult on its effect on the party. Another reason why he did not inform the authorities was, because he didn't wish to injure his party in the coming election. There was danger of that, if the revolution was made public. DODD was here for two weeks and WALKER for ten days. He told them they would be arrested, and they left. DODD claimed that the scheme was true until KERR charged it upon him. At the two days' meeting of the Central Committee, Aug. 12, this revolutionary plot was discussed. They said the plot must be dropped. WALKER was called to that meeting, and assured the Committee that it was stopped, Aug. 11. WALKER told BINGHAM he must be at the Bates House to meet the rebel officers from Louisville, who were to consult him while en route to Chicago to release the rebel prisoners there, and notify them that the revolution was postponed. In August, about the time the arms were found in DODD's building, a messenger brought him a communication from DODD and WALKER, then in Chicago, professing to be addressed to the Committee of Thirteen, asking its publication in the Sentinel. He examined it, and refused to publish it. They proposed to publish it at DODD's office, but BINGHAM having an interest, said they should not publish it, and sent it back to WALKER, who said he wrote the address, and signed DODD's name as Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen. DODD was Grand-Commander. The men were sworn to obey him implicitly in this revolution. DODD expected assistance from members of the Order who came up to the mass meeting of Aug. 16, BINGHAM said no inducements or threats had drawn out this testimony. It was voluntary.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Remarkable Testimony by J.J.

"The Rochester Democrat states that on the day for registering votes, a prominent Democrat of one of the Wards of that city stated to the inspectors of election that he had one hundred and fifty soldiers' votes in his possession which contained only the McClellan electoral ticket, and inquired if he had authority to make up the deficient State and local tickets by adding there to the Democratic nominations! Singular and absurd as this statement was, the Board of Inspectors (Democratic) were divided in opinion, and could not decide the knotty question!

It likewise deserves notice that this claim of his has not been disputed by the organs of the party. The very essence and soul of the platform is thus affiliated to a man who, while he had the power as a legislator, voted steadily and consistently against every supply bill for paying the soldiers, and maintaining the national credit. Apart from the second resolution of the Chicago platform, that instrument is a mere compound of meaningless generalities. A part from Mr. VALLANDIGHAM, even that positive feature of the concern would have been wanting. Whatever there is of honest, open declaration in the party creed is VALLANDIGHAM's, and his alone.

Affairs in,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/06/archives/affairs-in-newzealand.html,Affairs in,"The last Oriental mail brought good news from New-Zealand to England. The Maori rebellion is virtually at an end. The victory of Col. GREER has broken the spirit and the power of the Waikato tribes, whose principal warriors, to the number of 150, repaired soon after to the British camp, sued for peace, surrendered their arms, and signed the declaration of allegiance in proof of their sincerity. These chiefs acted not only for themselves, but as the representatives of a formidable body of natives who were located in the neighborhood, and awaited information touching the issue of the negotiations, in order that, if the conditions were favorable, they, too, might make their submission. The conditions offered to the natives are certainly most favorable, as explained by the Governor; but it seems somewhat doubtful whether they will be honestly carried out. The good intentions of Gov. GREY need not be called in question, yet he may lack the power to realize them. His Excellency can accomplish little without the sanction of the Colonial Administration and Colonial Legislature, both of which are strongly opposed to the lenient policy. The Governor assured the Maori Chiefs that they should be well treated, and that only a small portion of their lands should be forfeited. Hardly, however, had he uttered this assurance when the Government, with their surveyors and auctioneers, were busy at work on a great body of territory, one-half of which they pronounced confiscated, and the other half they compelled the natives to sell at such prices as the robbers felt disposed to pay. The entire tract contains 47,000 acres, and of these, all were wrung from the rebels save 3,000. This is a pretty illustration of the value which should be attached to Gov. GREY's assurance, and of the disregard of the New-Zealand authorities for their sovereign's representative whenever, his ideas happen to clash with their own.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Affairs in New-Zealand.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Affairs in New-Zealand.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6b325d1-be4c-5d1e-9e54-6970f883888c,497,nyt://article/e6b325d1-be4c-5d1e-9e54-6970f883888c,

Long before the doors were open a large crowd assembled eager for admittance, and within fifteen minutes after they were opened, every seat in the house was filled. Before 8 o'clock every aisle was also filled, and there was assembled within the building one of the most respectable and intelligent audiences, very many of whom were ladies, ever gathered within it. COLLETTIS' brass band furnished some excellent music. At 8 o'clock Major-Gen, SICKLES made his appearance upon the stage and was greeted with a hearty round of applause, the entire audience rising to their feet, the gentlemen cheering and the ladies waving their handkerchiefs. Three cheers were then proposed for Gen. SICKLES and given with a will, and scarcely had the audience resumed their seats when a gray-haired old gentleman rose and proposed ""three more cheers for the hero of Chancellorsville."" Again the audience sprang to their feet, and again the cheers were given as only strong patriotic men can give them. After the cheering had ceased, the meeting was called to order by Mr. E.T. WOOD, who said he had been deputed by the War Democrats of Brooklyn to call the meeting to order, and he wished to congratulate the whole country that there was a Democracy still left in this land, this glorious old United States, that did not believe in the Chicago platform [cheers;] that there was yet a Democracy which did not believe in a cessation of hostilities until the rebels in arms should cease to fire on the United States flag, and that there was a Democracy which did not believe this war to be a failure, and which could not discover any failure in the grand march of GRANT toward Richmond, nor SHERIDAN's glorious actions in the Shenandoah, [cheers,] and he wished to congratulate the audience that old JOE. HOOKER, a Democrat, had bravely carried the American flag even above the clouds, [cheers,] and that he and Democrats like him were ready to sustain the old flag and carry it safely through everything with which it might have to contend. Such Democrats as these had met at the Cooper Institute a few nights previous, and he was proud to say he was one of them, and he thought the audience would agree with him in saying that at that grand meeting they had framed a platform which would need no whitewashing, and one which the candidate it supported need not take nine days to think over, and consider as to whether or no it was respecable. Many gentlemen of Brooklyn had asked him what this War Democracy intended to do? He would tell them one thing they did not intend to do; they did not intend to go so far up Salt River as never to be heard from again, and they did intend to support the Government, and to support and act with the brave soldiers in the field. He then nominated as President of the evening Hon. SAMUEL E.

Those who have gone were often those whom we least could spare. How many of the best young men of the country, can we all recall -- many of them the descendants of old and honored families, many on whom years of patient industry and culture had been spent to fit them for high positions of usefulness and honor; some possessing ample fortune, some gifted with those high qualities of character which pointed them out as ""leaders of men,"" beloved and respected through wide circles of friends; others scholars and showing already marks of high intellect, and even of genius; others again fitted for great success in practical branches, and with those talents which, in this country certainly, carry fortune with them -- all of them abandoning ease and literary culture, and civic honors, and the refinements of wealth, for the hard life of camps, and at last sacrificing life willingly for the great cause of liberty and country. If the wealth of a country lies in its best men, then would our Union soon seem impoverished.

An evacuation was then ordered under a severe shelling, which was effected without much loss. Col. WHITFORD acted with conspicuous bravery."" As Middle River does not appear on the ordinary maps, and there may appear to be something of a paradox in the statement that gunboats went up one river and came down another, it is proper to state that there are three channels in the Roanoke at this point, separated by strips of land extending above Plymouth, the main channel passing by that place.

This person being put on trial, has made a clean breast of it. He says that he joined the ""American Knights"" a year ago -- that last August he was called upon by DODD, the commander of the organization in Indiana, and some other prominent members of the order, and, under pledge of secrecy, was told that a revolution had been determined upon in resistance to the draft -- that arrangements had been made to release the rebel prisoners at Johnson's Island, Camp Douglass, Camp Chase and Camp Morton -- that GOV. MORTON was to be killed -- and that there was to be a rising at the same time in Louisville to seize the Government stores, and other property. BINGHAM thought the information so important, that as chairman of the Democratic Central Committee, he immediately called a meeting of the committee, ""to consult on its effect on the party."" The committee decided that the plan must not go on, and for that reason it was postponed. Being asked in court why he had not informed the authorities that this plot was on foot, BINGHAM replied, ""I did not wish to injure our party at the coming election. There was danger of that if the revolution were made public."" BINGHAM closed his sworn statements by saying, ""no inducements or threats have drawn out this testimony.

The train was three hours behind time, but, it is said, was proceeding at the usual rate of speed, not stopping at Callicoon, and was thrown off the track in consequence of the switch having been left open. It seems that there has been no switchman at that place, and as near as we could be informed, the responsibility of the switch has been left with the conductors, who have had occasion to use it. The engine, tender, baggage-car, and three passenger cars were precipitated down an embankment of thirty feet and smashed to pieces, the engine being turned end-for-end, the boiler torn from the frame, and the whole mass heaped in the mud of the creek which the railroad crosses at that place. There were six passenger-cars. Of the three last two ran partly off the embankment; the last one remained on the track. THOS. G. CLARK, Traveling Superintendent in the Post-office Department, headquarters in this city, had just stepped upon the engine to ride a short distance, and was killed. He has been long and well known in connection with the Post-office. His body was brought to this city at 11 o'clock last night, the first train coming through at that hour. ARTHUR BANK, of Port Jervis, a machinist in employ of the New-York and Erie Railroad Company, was killed, and his remains were taken to Port Jervis. Two others were killed -- HORACE BERRVGER, the fireman, and WM.H. CREDDLE, a private of the One Hundred and Forty-third Regiment New-York Volunteers. WM. HULL, of Susquehanna, was so severely cut and bruised, it is thought, he cannot recover. Many others were seriously injured -- the number of wounded being between thirty and forty, of whom several were ladies. The conductor was Mr. FRED.

Sharing Fate of his Comrades,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/07/archives/why-didnt-he.html,Sharing Fate of his Comrades,"-- Mr. BELMONT, in that speech which he delivered at the Cooper Institute on Wednesday evening, informed his auditors that Gen. MCCLELLAN ""offered to share the fate of his comrades as a common soldier when deprived of his command by the intrigues of HALLECK and STANTON."" This reminds us somewhat of the magnanimous ""offer"" made a year ago by the redoubtable TOOMBS, of Georgia. That eminent person declared, in a speech delivered, we believe, in Augusta, that ""when all was lost,"" meaning all that appertains to the Confederacy, he would himself seek a patriot's grave by baring his breast to the bayonets of the foe. There was, however, nothing in the world to prevent the brave man from offering himself up as a sacrifice for his country before ""all was lost,"" and it was then only that his untimely end would be of the slightest use to the public. His perishing after all was over, would profit nobody, and his postponement of this supreme proof of his devotion until everybody else had stopped fighting, naturally led a good many people to suspect that in reality he never meant to make it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""WHY DIDN'T HE?"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""WHY DIDN'T HE?"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b259d1e8-03b1-5c02-aa82-8b6c55073700,453,nyt://article/b259d1e8-03b1-5c02-aa82-8b6c55073700,

Springfield Republican on New-York Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/08/archives/newyork-politics.html,Springfield Republican on New-York Politics,"The Republicans of New-York have a singularly bad habit of throwing away their opportunities. If they have a chance to do something handsome and achieve a decided success, the chances are that they will divide that they may be conquered the more easily. This is what they are absurdly doing at this election in the Sixth and Eighth Congressional Districts in New-York City. United they have a fair prospect of carrying both districts. So, to make defeat certain, there are two Republican candidates running in each district, and the contest is very sharp, while the Democrats stand by, ready to take the prizes offered to them. It would be a great matter to break the unity of the New-York City delegation in Congress for the Opposition, and it is inexcusable in the Republicans that they refuse to do it. The Sixth District would do itself great credit by electing Mr. RAYMOND, of the TIMES. His Republican competitor, Mr. RUSH C. HAWKINS, may be a very excellent man, but Mr. RAYMOND has a national reputation, and eminent qualifications for service in Congress. It would be a wise and patriotic thing in Mr. HAWKINS to withdraw and give his support to Mr. RAYMOND, since it is certain that by running against him he gives the place to the Democratic candidate. So in the Eighth District Mr. WILLIAM E. DODGE will undoubtedly obtain the larger part of the Republican votes, but Mr. MANNI???ERS, the Second Republican candidate, will probably secure enough votes to give the election to the Democratic candidate. Is there no means by which these senseless divisions can be healed, and two valuable Republican members of Congress be elected from New-York City? The object is certainly worth an effort.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-York Politics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-York Politics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Springfield Republican, Nov. 1', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Nov', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3c2f08a7-c567-53bf-bb59-881de14727a5,288,nyt://article/3c2f08a7-c567-53bf-bb59-881de14727a5,

"Election; ""The Momentous Day""",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/08/archives/the-momentous-day.html,"Election; ""The Momentous Day""","The day has come -- the day of fate. Before this morning's sun sets, the destinies of this republic, so far as depends on human agency, are to be settled for weal or for woe. An inevitable choice is this day to be made by the American people, between a policy carrying salvation or a policy carrying ruin to the nation. On the one hand is war, tremendous and terrible, yet ushering in at the end every national security and glory. On the other is the mocking shadow of a peace, tempting us to quit these sacrifices, and sink again into indulgence, and yet sure to rob us of our birthright, and to entail upon our children a dissevered Union and ceaseless strife. As the popular decision of this day is rendered in favor of the principles declared at Baltimore, or the principles declared at Chicago, so must either this or that consequence follow. The two men for whom the votes are to be cast are nothing in the presence of this mighty issue. Whatever their respective merits or faults, and however legitimately these, in ordinary times, might determine which of the two should be accepted and which rejected, such personal considerations are but as the dust in the balance when policies of such dread import are to be weighed. The Union party has no reason to shrink from any comparison of the candidates. But such comparing is, after all, very much like debating the qualifications of ship commanders, one of whom would have to do with the ship on the broad high seas, under the fierce gale, the other with the ship already launched into the resistless sweep of a Niagara, or sliding down into the relentless vortex of the Maelstrom. GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN might be all that his most extravagant admirers claim him to be, and a thousand times beyond, and yet he would be as helpless as an infant to stay the destruction of the Union in the line of the policy marked out for him by his party at Chicago. It is not within the power of mortal man to abandon the war at this stage, and make terms with the rebellion that will not involve the wreck of all that constitutes us a nation. Every man that casts his vote to-day should keep his eyes on this mighty fact. His choice is to be made, not between persons but between policies. The sovereign question is whether this rebellion, which is assailing the life of the Union, is to be dealt with on the principle of maintaining the national authority, or on the principle of surrendering it -- in other words, whether we are to have stability through the ascendancy of law, or subversion through the triumph of lawlessness. We are making this decision not for ourselves simply. We are settling the lot of the generations that shall come after us. If the people err,",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Momentous Day.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Momentous Day.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/423bc683-3ddc-5c8c-9cae-198036aa945e,650,nyt://article/423bc683-3ddc-5c8c-9cae-198036aa945e,

BUTLER's ringing and explicit order on assuming command of the entire military forces in the State of New-York, profoundly excited the city yesterday. The blood of the people was stirred by it, in spite of the damp and drizzling weather, Its terse reasons, its trenchant statements, its sharp rebukes and significant warnings, struck home alike to loyal hearts and disloyal consciences. To the one class it brought full assurance of order and peace at the polls, and to the other a perfect understanding that devilish machinations of every kind would be foiled in their first outcroppings. Gen. BUTLER's sudden transfer from the field before Richmond, where only a week since he was sulking at open foes, to the command of the troops in the Empire State, where there is come reason to believe that secret enemies of the nation have been active in their vile plotting, was scarcely expected. It was hinted at a few days since, but was hardly known outside a narrow official circle, and its public announcement had all the effect of a great moral sensation. There had been misgivings felt by many that to-day would witness a repetition in this city of the disgraceful scenes of the July riots of 1863; there had been a widespread and indefinable dread that rebel emissaries would seize the exciting time of a general election to put in execution the villainous threats recently made by the Richmond papers of laying New-York, Buffalo, and other Northern cities in ashes; there had been vague fears entertained by weak-kneed folk that it would be unsafe in certain districts to exercise the right of suffrage. But the doubting, the dreading and the timid, at once felt a seusible diminution of their tears on the announcement that Gen. BUTLER, the man of iron nerve and steady purpose, who knows how to deal with all sorts of mobs, was in their midst, with a proper force to preserve the peace. The wisdom of the Government in selecting the man who had scattered the howling rabble of New-Orleans like chaff, and reduced that city to order most serene, approved itself to the conscience of every patriot, and made Copperheads squirm and writhe in torture.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEN.

They started three or four campaigns for that purpose, but they have all come to grief -- just at the wrong time for them. PRICE made a grand rush into Missouri a few weeks since, to stump the State for Little MCCLELLAN, and ravage it for JEFF. DAVIS; but, before the election, PLEASONTON has routed him in fearful style, and his two best officers, MARMADUKE and CABELL, are by this time on Johnson's Island. HOOD and BEAUREGARD, in like manner, went forth to invade Tennessee, and JEFF. DAVIS proclaimed publicly at Columbia that the main object of the campaign was to help the prospects of the peace candidate for the Presidency by showing to the North the hopelessness of the war. ""I believe,"" said he, ""it is in the power of the men of the Confederacy to plant our banners on the banks of the Ohio, where we may say to the Yankee 'be quiet, or we shall teach you another lesson.' Let fresh victories crown our arms, and the peace party, if there be such at the North, can elect its candidate."" In the same speech he said: ""Does any man imagine that we can conquer the Yankees by retreating before them, or do you not all know that the only way to make spaniels civil is to whip them?"" This speech was delivered on the 4th of October, and in it DAVIS dwells again and again on the imperative necessity of rebel successes ""within the next thirty days,"" showing his desperate anxiety that they should occur before our Presidential election, and in time to affect popular sentiment and action at the North. Well, thirty days and more have passed, and what is the upshot, or what is the prospect, of HOOD's and BEAUREGARD's great politico- military campaign in behalf of the peace candidate? The rebel army has not set foot in Tennessee; the feeble attempt which it made to cross the Tennessee River was easily repulsed; and Gen. SHERMAN evidently regards the whole movement with philosophical contempt. He holds Atlanta firmly; all his communications with Chattanooga are perfect; the latter stronghold is impregnable; so likewise are Murfreesboro and Nashville, and what can HOOD and BEAUREGARD do? The probability is that henceforth Gen. SHERMAN will pay but little attention to them, and will now prosecute the campaign through Georgia in his own way.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Efforts and Failures to Aid the Peace Candidate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Efforts and Failures to Aid the Peace Candidate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea38df56-6d91-5da7-8ea5-cde4452e4e13,528,nyt://article/ea38df56-6d91-5da7-8ea5-cde4452e4e13,

Sadly and sorrowfully they will return to their homes, and Commissioners from the grim traitor will be sent to Washington.

Mr. TERWILLIGER closed by exhorting his hearers to work faithfully for the cause, and if LINCOLN should be reelected, the stars and stripes would again wave over the plains and savannahs of the South as proudly as of yore, and this great, free and glorious nation will exist until the strong angel, with one foot on sea and the other on land, shall swear by Him that liveth forever and ever, that time shall be no more.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4aaa479-2296-5d46-b635-2bed8131f5bd,459,nyt://article/f4aaa479-2296-5d46-b635-2bed8131f5bd,

Hon George Brown's Speech,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/09/archives/the-british-american-confederation.html,Hon George Brown's Speech,"-- In a speech delivered at Toronto, on Thursday last, Hon. GEORGE BROWN, one of the leading members of the Canadian Government, gave a semi-official outline of the scheme of federal union adopted by the Quebec Conference. It differs in no essential particular from the programme which our special correspondent was in a position to furnish several weeks ago. Mr. BROWN, indeed, says that the outline (which was first published in the TIMES) was given with surprising accuracy. We notice from the tone of the Toronto addresses that the delegates are not disposed to submit their project to the test of a popular vote. They seem to think that there is a sufficient indication of the popularity of the measure in the fact that the delegates belong to different political parties. It is doubtful whether this argument can hold water. The people may be prepared to give their assent to the principle of union, and may yet be thoroughly opposed to the details of the measure. As, for instance, to that part of it which deprives them of the right of electing members of the Legislative Council, and vests that power in the Crown. It is not a satisfactory sign, in any case, this of hurrying through a great constitutional measure without consulting the people.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BRITISH AMERICAN CONFEDERATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BRITISH AMERICAN CONFEDERATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/204f514b-b02e-5cef-93b1-1228ab3b483e,215,nyt://article/204f514b-b02e-5cef-93b1-1228ab3b483e,

Its records more seldom meet our eye than formerly; but able and devoted men are nevertheless still working, in numbers greater than at any former time, in the cultivation of a field where little apparent??? success appears to cheer the laborer, and an exalted sense of duty must be his guide and support in the absence of sublunary triumphs. The volume before us is the record, by a younger brother, of one who went out as a missionary to Hindostan, and died there eighteen months after his arrival, in his 28th year. So brief a career might seem scarcely to claim a volume, but in the hands of a brother the subject grows under his loving care, and we obtain a competent picture of one, in many respects, worthy of commemoration. DAVID COIT SCUDDER, though cut off at so youthful a period of life, had approved himself no common man. The h???e influences of a Puritan household -- pious, without asceticism -- familiarized him for years with his destined field of labor, and all the energies of a close and earnest student were employed in fitting himself for his intended occupation of it. Probably few missionaries ever reached India better furnished, intellectually, for their work. There was nothing approaching to cant in DAVID SCUDDER. That his religious convictions were all powerful, was proved by the position he filled at their suggestion; but he was the man to give the whole of his intellect full play, feeling that the more avenues he kept open for knowledge, the better. A good instance of the breadth of his studies is given in the chapter entitled ""Search among Cromlechs."" This will be read with attention in England, and gives some valuable antiquarian information overlooked by all the English residents in India. Mr. SCUDDER wrote well and unaffectedly. He is judiciously allowed to tell his own story in the letters and journals that compose the greater part of the volume. He was not a sanguine worker, but saw clearly the immense obstacles to missionary success on the system now adopted. The book unconsciously throws light on this question, as on many others connected with the Christianization of India.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LIFE AND LETTERS OF DAVID COIT SCUDDER, Missionary in Southern India, By HORACE E.

Familiar Letters from Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/09/archives/familiar-letters-from-europe-by-cornelius-conway-felton-late.html,Familiar Letters from Europe,"There is little in these unpremeditated and genuine effusions of a genial and cultivated mind to call for critical remark. They are, what they profess to be, familiar letters -- brief notes, addressed from time to time to members of the writer's circle of friends and relatives, descriptive of the objects that most prominently excited his curiosity in a tour through England, France, Germany and Greece. President FELTON'S visit to Europe naturally brought him in contact with the first men of the time, and rather tantalizing glimpses are given of days of intercourse with literary celebrities and others, when full accounts would have been more gratifying to most of us who are hero-worshippers of the Boswellian type. The studies of Prof. FELTON'S Greek Professorship fitted him for the intense enjoyment of the classi- ???alportion of his journey, and perhaps the most noticeable feature in this book is the testimony it bears to the old Orthodox belief in the Homeric question. While reading the Iliad face to face with the scenes of the immortal tale, he says deliberately, and with Anglo-Saxon-common sense: ""I cannot doubt that HOMER saw this spot. I do not see how any one can traverse these seas, and not believe in Troy, and the personal existence of HOMER. It would do the learned critics of Germany no harm to come here, and look about them a little, before they decide that Troy is a fable, and HOMER a myth."" To the many hundreds throughout the country who came in contact with Professor FELTON during their student days, this volume Will be welcome, as recalling the memory of one too early lost from the literary and social circles, where his presence imparted to all a share of the joyous elasticity and gaiety of his own happy temperament.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FAMILIAR LETTERS FROM EUROPE, by CORNELIUS CONWAY FELTON, late President of Harvard University. 12mo.

It is sure to become a popular book, as long as the great names of the golden age of the Theatre retain their attraction. In the composition of a work of this kind the chief difficulty lies in selection, for, scattered through a great variety of sources, the materials for a history of the English Stage are far more abundant than any that the learned professions or more dignified pursuits can show. Judged by this test the pulpit and the bar occupy a less prominent position than that of the ""poor player,"" who, when ""seen no more"" upon the stage, yet ""frets and struts"" in the pages of the biographer, or his own reminisences. Some of the most lively and sparkling books in our language are of this description, and a literary workman of Dr. DORAN'S ability could not fail to make a digest of them that retains much of the charm of the originals. The actors -- those ""diverting vagabonds"" -- (as Dr. JOHNSON somewhere called them,) stand indeed a better chance to be remembered than most of their graver cotemporaries. There are many among them whose talents might adorn, and their virtues reflect credit on any sphere of action. GARRICK. KEMBLE, SIDDONS, CHARLES KEAN, BETTERTON, and others, are names that would ennoble any profession, and if many of equal ability with those mentioned failed to rival their virtues, the very delinquencies that their names recall, but add to the never failing interest with which we read of PEG WOFFINGTON, KITTY CLIVE, SAMUEL FOOTE, EDMUND KEAN, COLLEY CIBBER, and a whole host of names classic on the boards of Old Drury. Under ???riple heading of ""Actors, Authors and Audiences,"" Dr. DORAN leaves no corner of theatrical history unvisited that could add to the completeness of his picture of the drama in England. This is traced from its origin, when the players were merely an appendage to regal state, acting by virtue of a royal patent, under the regulation and supervision of an officer of the King's household, the Lord Chamberlain, to the year 1843, when ""their Majesties servants"" became a formality only, and free trade in the drama was established. Dr. DORAN'S style is objectionable as being too obtrusively vivacious; he is nothing if not piquant, and can scarcely repeat the witticism of another without barbina the arrow and sharpening the point. This manner of writing is, however, less out of place in dramatic annuls than in the discussion of graver subjects; and his book bids fair to be the source from whence future ideas of the players and playwrights of the past will continue to be drawn. The work is got up in very correct typographical taste, and does credit to Mr. WIDDLETON'S enterprise.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': '""THEIR MAJESTIES\' SERVANTS.""

Dix has found worthy of perpetuation various memorials of the events with which he was personally connected as a public officer, or that came before him in his legislative capacity while representing the Empires State of New-York in the Senate of the United States. That he has done wisely in placing on record his public acts and the documents connected with them no one will deny; and it is to his credit as a statesman and a man that there is so much in the past that he takes pleasure in recalling. It is at least evidence that his views have borne the test of time, and were adopted on enduring principle rather than in obedience to any ad captandum cry of the moment. Gen. DIX has always loved and cherished literature, for its own sake as well as for the delightful solace it affords to the mind jaded and weary of the tortuous paths of modern politics; and these elegant volumes contain evidence of the healthy scholarship that assimilates its intellectual food and does not make a mere parade of acquirements to astonish the groundlings. The chief portion of the volumes comprises Gen. DIX'S Senatorial Speeches, collected and revised by himself in accordance with a long cherished resolution. They were mostly delivered during the years 1846-49, and show the connection of the author with all the great national movements of the time. Some of the more prominent topics of these speeches are ""the Oregon Question,"" ""French Spoliations,"" ""The Warehouse System,"" ""The War with Mexico,"" ""The Appointment of a Minister to the Papal States,"" &c. The entire list shows how wide is Gen, DIX'S range of information, and it is not too much to say that even at this day something will be found of importance on every question discussed. The next division consists of occasional addresses and a few specimens of the numerous official reports intrusted to his care during his connection with public affairs. Many of the addresses relate to social rather than to political subjects, as ""Rural Life and Embellishment,"" ""On the Growth of New-York City,"" ""The Progress of Science,"" ""The Education of Teachers,"" &c., and show a mind fertile in resources, and able to bring them to bear at once on any topic requiring attention. Only a few papers relating to the present condition of affairs are included in these volumes; among them, however, is displayed, in lithographic fac simile, the memorable order concluding with the instruction to shoot on the spot ""any one who attempts to haul down the American Flag."" The volumes are brought out in the finest style of typographical execution, and are preceded by a steel portrait of Gen. DIX. By him the work is dedicated to his wife, as an acknowledgment of the intelligent and devoted cooperation she has lent him in all the vicissitudes and labors of his life.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SPEECHES AND OCCASIONAL ADDRESSES.

The endowment of the Graham foundation had for its end a principle similar to the famous bequest of the Earl of BRIDGEWATER, in the last generation, and the results of Mr. GRAHAM'S munificence, by which it was provided that the power, wisdom and goodness of God should be illustrated from time to time by evidence derived from the progressive study of nature, promise to equally important for Christian science. Prof. COOKE is recognized abroad and at home as one of the first names among our cultivators of natural philosophy, and he was judiciously chosen to cooperate with AGASSIZ and GUYOT, by whom series of lectures have been delivered, that will shortly appear in a style uniform with the present work. The range of Prof. COOKE'S inquiries being limited to a single topic -- the atmosphere and its component parts, and the testimony they afford of an intelligent first cause in their adaptation to the physical condition of man -- greater detail is attained than is customary in works on natural theology. Viewed as a scientific book alone, on its special subject, we know of none that can come in competition with Religion and Chemistry, while the polished and elegant style of the author, and his earnest conviction, everywhere apparent, that the truths he explains owe their chief value to the glimpses they afford us of the Divine economy of creation, impart to it a peculiar and signal value. How and in what manner, to the enlightened philosopher, ""the Heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth His handiwork, as Plainly as they do to the untaught eye of faith, may briefly be described as the object of these lectures They proceed from an examination and analysis of the separate elements composing the atmosphere as oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, &c., in which the scientific information is of the latest character, to the arguments from special adaptation, and the general plan, as furnishing unquestionable proof of intelligent design. With some cautionary remarks on the necessary limits of scientific and religious thought, the author completes a work creditable to himself, and calculated to arrest and reward the attention of all thinking men.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""RELIGION AND CHEMISTRY, OR PROOFS OF GOD'S PLAN IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ITS ELEMENTS.

""Ocean Steam Navigation"" is a capital article, and surveys the whole subject, explaining, among other things, the causes of the failure of the Collins line and the success of the Cunard Company. It is written with a full knowledge of the matter in all its bearings, and contains valuable hints for future guidance. Goldwin Smith does justice to one of the ablest writers and clearest thinkers of the day, who has earned the gratitude of all Americans. In the words of the reviewer, If the highest duty of a professor of history is to apply the lessons of the past to the understanding of the present time, and In the conflict and confusion of contending forces and opinions, to discover and set forth the truth, he has well performed it."" ""Nathaniel Hawthorne"" opens new and charming views of the ancestry, surroundings and private life of our late novelist. The Near General Election"" battles vigorously for the right. The Critical Notices are acute and uncompromising specimens of independent animadversion, not entirely of what CARLYLE would call the rose-water order. We regard this as the best number of the North American yet published by the new editors.

Any objections to it, grounded on the assumption, which has been so loudly put forward, that he had used the powers of the Government in a way of which the country did not dream when it lodged them in his hands, and of which it has not approved since it has witnessed it, are now completely disposed of. The nation has watched his manner of administering the Government for four years. It knows all about the confiscation act, the ""arbitary arrests,"" the emancipation proclamation, the conscription acts, the ""bastiles,"" the ??? public debt, the test oaths, the dismissal of GEORGE B.

Winslow's Summary,"-- The particulars of the capture of the Florida will be all the more eagerly scanned from the doubt which surrounds the transaction, on grounds both of policy and law. Capt. WINSLOW, at the Boston Navy-yard, on Tuesday, gave a brief summary of the facts which, we have no doubt, are perfectly authentic, although that distinguished officer had no further act or part in the matter than bringing the prisoners captured from St. Thomas to Boston harbor. The capture was made on the morning of the 7th of October, while the Florida was lying in the harbor of Bahia, close up to the city. This statement differs not a little from that which we published on Wednesday. That report represented that the Wachusett was lying close into the harbor, but that the Florida was outside. The difference, as affects the interpretation of the maritime rights of the neutral Powers, of course, amounts to nothing. But the difference is not without significance, as marking the strength of impulse as distinct from the strength of reason, which, in the two cases, would guide Capt. COLLINS in acting as he did.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CAPTURE OF THE FLORIDA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CAPTURE OF THE FLORIDA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1971b9ac-0d00-530e-8f75-80df5678be82,188,nyt://article/1971b9ac-0d00-530e-8f75-80df5678be82,

SHERMAN, which were published exclusively in the TIMES of yesterday, should have produced a profound sensation throughout the country. We have had nothing of a military character analogous to it in the course of the war -- if we except the grand march made by SHERMAN from Vicksburgh across the State of Mississippi, at the beginning of this year; and even that remarkable campaign differed, and was inferior, in many important particulars, to the new one whose outlines we gave. The end to be achieved in this case is far more important; the distance to be traversed much greater; the time to be covered much longer; the difficulties to be overcome much more formidable; and the operating column much heavier. In the former case, the rebel army was in his front, and he drove it before him; in this case he leaves it in his rear, and takes no heed of it. From Atlanta to Augusta is one hundred and seventy-one miles; from Augusta to Charleston one hundred and twenty-one miles, to Savannah one hundred and thirty-six miles. But, as an evening cotemporary, in quoting our news, correctly remarks, ""the country is not difficult; no mountain ranges lie in the way, to make transportation laborious, such as ROSECRANS met in Tennessee in his campaign against Chattanooga; no passes or defiles present easily defensible positions to an opposing force; the whole region both to the south and east is rich in food, and has been untouched by the war.

He was brought in a carriage, and they conveyed into the hall in a chair, supported by a platoon of our returned soldiers, and received by the citizens of the town rising from their seats, amid the tears and heartfelt emotions of all present. After resting for a moment, the venerable patriot expressed a desire to shake hands with all the returned soldiers. Some thirteen soldiers then formed in line, when each one was introduced to the patriarch, and took him by the hand, with the announcement of the time each had served in the army. After this, three hearty cheers were given for the returned soldiers, and three rousing cheers by the whole assembly for the ""old soldier of the revolution.""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Interesting Incident of Election Day.; A CENTENNARIAN AT THE POLLS IN STURBRIDGE.

and Capt Ericsson,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/12/archives/the-dictator-and-capt-ericsson.html,and Capt Ericsson,"- It will be seen that the great ocean iron-clad monitor ram Dictator, which made her trial trip in the bay yesterday, failed to approve herself the perfect machine which had been promised. There has been great discussion about this vessel among naval men during her progress in building; but Capt. ERICSSON's name, and his notes, have done much to keep up public confidence in her. Persons had even gone so far as to assert that she would not float above water at all; but that when she got her guns, ordnance-stores and coal aboard, she would be at least level with the water, if not several inches or feet under it. In reply to these criticisms and assertions, Capt. ERICSSON wrote a note a few days ago, in which he said that ""nothing has occurred to indicate that the Dictator will disappoint the expectation of the Navy Department;"" and further stated, that on the 2d inst., when she had two-thirds of her stores, half her complement of shot, and six hundred tons of coal aboard, she was thirty-one inches out of water at the stern, and forty-three inches out of water at the bow -- that her draft was halt an inch less than the estimates, and that she would have to be brought eight inches deeper in order to be in proper fighting trim. These statements from Capt. ERICSSON were very reassuring. On the trial trip, yesterday, however, according to the naval report of it, the vessel was carefully measured, and found to be above the surface of the water as follows: Forward, 2 feet 10 inches; aft, 2 feet; amidships, 15 1/4 inches. How much further she will be depressed when she gets all of her war stock aboard, remains to be seen -- though we suppose it is a matter capable of calculation. The naval report also sets forth other serious defects in the Dictator's steerage and movements.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DICTATOR AND CAPT.

In the month of January, 1847, at a certain dinner party in London, at which Lord JOHN RUSSELL, Lord MORPETH, Mr. BATES, and many other distinguished men were present, the conversation turned upon the Irish famine; and the remark was made by Lord JOHN that he rejoiced that so good a substitute for the native breadstuff had been found as the Indian corn. Turning to Mr. BATES his lordship went on to say, ""Why, BATES, some of the cobs have twelve or fourteen rows of grain on them."" Mr. BATES coolly replied, ""Yes, my Lord, I have seen from twenty to twenty-four rows on a cob."" ""That is a rank Yankeeism,"" was the pleasant retort of the Premier, and the whole company shouted in approval. The burst of incredulous merriment over, Mr. BATES bought his peace by a wager of a dinner for the company all round that he could produce such an ear.

Literary Gossip,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/12/archives/literary-gossip.html,Literary Gossip,"An interesting literary relie has come to light unexpectedly in Scotland, where a gentleman, Mr. J.D. CAMPBELL, of Glasgow, has printed an elegant 4 -- to the edition limited to 250 copies -- ""Some portions of the essays contributed to the Spectator, by Mr. JOSEPH ADDISON, now first printed from his M.S. note book."" The original manuscript from which the volume is printed, was purchased for a small price of a London bookseller in 1858. On examination it was found to contain, though imperfect at the beginning, several of ADDISON'S papers for the Spectator, written out in a neat clerkly hand on one side-of the leaves like a first draft, and numerous interlinear corrections, and additions on the opposite blank pages, in the undoubted writing of ADDISON himself. These changes and enlargements are very curious, and show by what careful attention to minutiae, the style, ""familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious,"" (to use the words of JOHNSON,) that has conferred immortality upon its author, was acquired and perfected. Among the better-known papers thus shown in progress of construction are the essays on Jealousy and Fame, and a portion of the celebrated essay on the Imagination. A more instructive lesson on composition could hardly be given than this work affords. Some critics have insinuated doubts, owing to a want of a history of the M.S., but the internal evidence of its genuineness appears to be complete and satisfactory.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8b4845b1-aa7e-5cb3-8000-cd1b857d8271,1456,nyt://article/8b4845b1-aa7e-5cb3-8000-cd1b857d8271,

The Lady Sterling was built in London, and launched about four months ago. She is built of iron, and is about 960 tons burden, and had on board when captured over 400,000 pounds of cotton and some four tons of tobacco. Although she was in a disabled condition -- one of her cylinders being useless -- her Captain resolved to leave Wilmington with her. On the night of Oct. 28, coming out by what is known as the Western Bar Channel, she was soon seen by the United States steamer Eolus, and endeavoring to escape from her, found the United States steamer Calypso directly in her way. From the Calypso a number of shots were fired at the runner, the second one -- a shell -- exploding in the cotton stowed in her fore-hold. Notwithstanding this she still kept on her way, the Calypso being in hot pursuit, and making about thirteen miles per hour. After a chase of some three hours in duration, during which some seven or eight shots were lodged in different parts of the hull and machinery of the blockade runner, she was forced to surrender. The United States steamer Eolus being near at the time of the capture, has a share in the prize.

"There are some interesting facts in regard to registry for the elections of Tuesday last, which deserve public consideration before they are forgotten. About 15,000 more voters were registered than votes were deposited. A certain proportion of these were undoubtedly registered twice in consequence of removals to other wards. But 6,000 would probably cover all these. We may fairly estimate that 9,000 or 10,000 voters staid at home, and from the great defection in the expected Democratic majority we may possibly conclude they were Democrats. What occasioned this astonishing falling off of persons who, a few weeks ago registered their names to vote? We think it not at all an improbable thing that the arrival of Gen. BUTLER has had a very significant connection with this fact. There are more than 10,000 Southern refugees in the city. They very naturally expected to vote. Had they voted, we should have had Gov.

It seems that two Germans residing in the rear of that number, named GEORGE NICKEL and LOUIS SCHLVECK, went out on Friday evening for the purpose of enjoying themselves in an innocent way by partaking of lager and in pleasant conversation. They went into one or two saloons, where, it would seem, they partook somewhat freely of the German beverage. At a late hour they returned home. When opposite their dwellings, they concluded to go into the front basement of No. 55 and have one more glass. They did so, and, as appears by the following testimony, taken yesterday by Coroner NAUMANN on the inquest, they had been inside but a few moments when the man behind the bar, named CHARLES P. ENGSTRON, drew a pistol from beneath the counter and instantly fired at NICKEL. The ball entered just on the right side of his nose, passed through the centre of his brain and came out at the back part of his skull. NICKEL fell to the floor and died almost instantly. It will be seen by the testimony of deceased's friend that at this time no word had passed between deceased and the barkeeper, and that the shooting was entirely unprovoked.

The entrance to this sea is protected by forts, which have been of late greatly strengthened, and which open fire on every European or American ship that ventures to approach them. To silence these forts then, and to bring Prince CHOSIN to terms, a formidable naval force has been organized, to which such of the foreign Powers having treaties with Japan, and which consider themselves aggrieved by this action of NAGATO, has contributed all the means of offence at their disposal in those waters -- the English, fifteen steamers, of various armament; the Dutch, four corvettes; the French, a line-of-battle ship and two smaller vessels; and the United States, one steamer.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Japanese Imbroglio.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Japanese Imbroglio.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Japan', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6b5a5da-cd6c-5d4d-8a00-b3054f8f0dbf,819,nyt://article/a6b5a5da-cd6c-5d4d-8a00-b3054f8f0dbf,

An elderly man, over whose head almost a century had passed, and who had voted for GEORGE WASHINGTON, when he was chosen President of the United States, turned his trembling steps from the grave, upon the brink of which he was almost tottering, and came, supported by his son and grandson, to give his last vote for ABRAHAM LINCOLN. He had twice voted for the Father of his country, and it was permitted him to vote twice for its Preserver. He had twice voted for GEORGE WASHINGTON, and he had lived to vote for the reelection of the man who will be gratefully remembered by the coming generation, not only of this country, but of the world, as the second Washington. The name of this venerable patriarch and patriot is GEORGE WILDER. He is the father of ARETUS A. WILDER, the well known machinist of this city.

"Comanche, Iron-clad, Launch",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/14/archives/naval.html,"Comanche, Iron-clad, Launch","LAUNCH OF THE CAMANCHE -- AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVENT -- YANKEES THE FIRST TO PLACE AN IRON-CLAD WAR VESSEL ON THE BOSOM OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN, &c., &c. -- It has been announced by telegraph across the Plains and over the mountains that on the 14th of November, 1864, the iron-clad monitor Camanche would be launched at San Francisco, Cal. The event will be handed down on the page of history as one of the greatest achievements of American enterprise. England, with all her boasting, cannot claim that she was the first to place her iron-clads in those waters. It is true, little Peru has an iron-clad just completed, but we date back to Nov. 11, 1863, when the Camanche arrived (in pieces) at San Francisco in the ship Aquilla. The Camanche is one of the first batch of monitors, and was built by SECOR & Co., under the superintendence of GEORGE BIRKBECK. Jr., at Jersey City. She was placed on board the ship Aquilla and sent around ""the Horn,"" arriving at San Francisco on Nov. 11, 1863. On the 16th of November, 1863, during the prevalence of a very severe gale, the Aquilla sunk, having over[???] rode her anchor and stove a hole in her bottom, and both vessels sunk in about 40 feet of water. It was not long before the contractors set to work, and the pieces were removed from the bilged vessel and landed safe on shore. A year has elapsed (lacking two days) and the Camanche is completed and afloat, a floating monument of American enterprise and of the growing importance of our navy. The following are the prominent dimensions of the Camanche: Extreme length over armor, 200 feet; extreme length of boat proper on water line, 190 feet; length outside of stem and stern-posts, 159 feet; breadth of beam of boat proper, 37 feet 8 inches; depth of hold amidships, 11 feet 10 inches; crown of deck amidships, 5 inches; shear of deck, 12 inches; distance from stem to extreme end of boat, 10 feet 9 inches; distance from stem to extreme end of armor forward, 16 feet; distance from stern-post to extreme end of boat aft, 20 feet 3 inches; distance from stern-post to extreme end of armor aft, 23 feet. She has one turret and carries a battery of two improved 15-inch guns, and as a harbor defence she will be of great service to San Francisco. We now have our iron-clad navy represented in the Pacific Ocean, and there is no telling where we may be in this respect in the next quarter of a century. Though insignificant as this launch may seem to some persons, yet it marks with an indelible clearness the progress of our navy in the waters of the world. The builders and the country should be proud to near of the successful launch of the Camanche, the first iron-clad of the Pacific.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naval.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Naval.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/33dc972a-d0fe-5c37-a8c7-a0d9b152481e,1933,nyt://article/33dc972a-d0fe-5c37-a8c7-a0d9b152481e,

The message of JEFFERSON DAVIS, which he delivered to his Congress in Richmond a week ago to-day, is not the only evidence which has lately come to hand of the state of internal commotion in which the Southern Confederacy finds itself at present. We gave yesterday the message which Gov. BROWN, of Georgia, delivered to the Legislature of that State on the 3d inst.; and this, taken with the articles from the Georgia newspapers, shows a state of feeling which must be anything but strengthening to the Confederacy. JEFF. DAVIS, in his late visit to his army in Georgia, took occasion to apply some very extraordinary and indecent epithets to Gov. BROWN; and from the message of the latter it appears certain that there was no love lost between these leaders. BROWN does not like DAVIS policy any better than DAVIS likes BROWN's person, though it must be confessed that if the rebel Governor equals the rebel President in trenchancy of language, he by no means compares with him in vulgarity of personal abuse. BROWN upbraids DAVIS for his policy toward the people and States of the South, and for his policy toward the Government of the North. He accuses him of attempting to establish a military despotism over the Southern Confederacy; and accuses him with refusing to enter into negotiations for peace with the North. He declares himself satisfied that a ""large majority of the people of Georgia disapprove many of the acts and much of the policy of the Confederate Administration."" He pronounces Southern independence without State sovereignty and liberty, to be very little better than subjugation, as ""it matters little who our master is, if we are to have one,"" and urges the rebel troops ""never to consent to lay down their arms till these principles are recognized by our foe and faithfully carried out in practice by our own (the rebel) Government."" He warns the Southern people ""never under any circumstances to consent to accept a strong centralized Government with military despotism;"" and immediately after this, with his eye fixed sternly upon JEFF. DAVIS, he says: ""I do not see how it can be denied by any candid man that we have, in practice, made fearful strides, since the war began, toward a centralized Government with unlimited powers. The longer the war lasts, the greater the tendency to this result, and the less probability at its termination of a return to the constitutional forms and republican simplicity which existed at its commencement.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Troubles of the Confederacy Gov.

MESSENGER was arrested on Saturday afternoon by Detective MCDOUGAL, on a charge of swindling by means of false checks. From the complaint made before Justice DOWLING yesterday, it appears that the accused went to the clothing store of Messrs. BROOKES, BROS. & CO., corner of Broadway end Grand-  street, and ordered a suit of clothes, which he directed to have sent to the Tammany Hotel. He subsequently countermanded these directions and ordered the goods sent to the Continental Hotel. This was done, and the porter of Messrs. BROOKES, BROS. & CO. received in payment for them a check on the Shoe and Leather Bank for $120, which proved to be worth nothing. Mr. WEYBOND, an attache of the store, complained against the accused, and he was taken into custody as above stated. It appears that Messrs.

We give the report chiefly for the purpose of showing the ready way in which the case was disposed of. All that BRAINE found it necessary to do, was to produce his so-called commission from S. R. MALLORY, ""Secretary of the Navy of the Confederate States."" That commission, the signature to which was, of course, easily vouched for by rebel sympathizers at Bermuda, appears to have designated BRAINE especially for the task of ""capturing upon the high seas the Federal steam Roanoke, or the steamers Morning or Evening Star, all of which are on a line running between New- York and Havana."" We presume that it is useless attempting to raise any question of the right of the Bermuda magistrates to grant the pirates a release under the circumstances -- admitting that BRAINE's commission was what it professed to be. It is, apparently, a settled part of British policy to accept such acts as the capture of the Chesapeake and the Roanoke as coming within the scope of fair belligerent rights.

"-We observe the honors which have been conferred in Boston upon Capt. WINSLOW, the hero of the Kearsarge and Alabama battle in the British Channel. Boston, however, though it contains many great men -- and though its greatest, such as Mr. EVERETT and Mr. DANA, honored themselves by honoring Capt. WINSLOW -- is yet a small place in which to give due honor to a man of such services and distinction. New-York is the commercial emporium of the Continent, the fountain of honor, the centre of things in general. Here are all the great ovations to greatness -- to foreign princes from England or Japan, to foreign and domestic heroes, from KOSSUTH to CORCORAN. Capt. WINSLOW should be invited to the Empire City. The Common Council should take the matter in hand. The Chamber of Commerce should see to it. We do not believe that even Mayor GUNTHER would object to jubilations on such an occasion, for Capt. WINSLOW's triumph was in foreign waters, and was more over a foreign than a domestic foe. Congress will soon meet, and will doubtless at once take steps to make the Captain an Admiral; but the people desire to show their appreciation even before that. The Kearsarge is to be laid up at Boston for some time for repairs, and as Capt. WINSLOW will have a respite from duty, there will be no time lost to him in being brought to New-York. We observe that in Boston they do not even know how to pronounce the name of his celebrated ship, one of the papers saying that the g is hard and that the word has three syllables, both of which statements are errors.

Up to the present time the armies of the United States have held their own in the matter of heavy ordnance; but so far as rifles and other small arms are concerned, the South has had the advantage. The very best guns made in Europe, and more especially in England, have been put at their disposal, and while we have depended upon guns, good enough in themselves, but by no means equal to the necessity of the case or, the advancements of the age, they have been applying the very best war instruments that science has invented or brought to light. This fact becomes notorious through the evidence of all our campaigns, and is still being made painfully apparent by the great mortality among our officers, caused by the superior power of the arms in the hands of the rebel sharpshooters. It is well known that Col. BERDAN, a gentleman who for many years past has devoted his attention to the study of mechanics, and more than ever to the improvement and perfection of small arms -- was the first to form a regiment of sharpshooters in this city. He would accept no men for the service but those who were the most perfect marksmen. He had numerous trials and experiments with his regiment, and it was not until he was perfectly satisfied with their skill and ability that he offered it to the Government. They were accepted, and of the service they did against the rebellion let the history of the war speak to the world. Such a body of sharpshooters, we believe, was never before seen, and during the full three years of service through which they passed, they proved to the world that the American sharpshooter was the most precise and unfailing that was ever heard of before.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Trail of Firearms at Flatbush, L.I.

Financial Troubles; Trenholm and Taxation; Trenholm and Taxation,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/15/archives/confederate-confessions.html,Financial Troubles; Trenholm and Taxation; Trenholm and Taxation,"-- Any one who desires to compare the report of DAVIS' new Finance Minister with that of his War Secretary, will find each an instructive commentary on the other. Mr. TRENHOLM, presenting the exigencies of the Treasury as a subject of public and prayerful meditation, draws attention to the fact that soldiers, soldiers' families, and the poor generally, have been the heaviest sufferers by the tax on the currency, and its depreciation. To protect the soldiers and the poor from the effects of this depreciation in the value of Confederate promissory notes, the Secretary considers a sacred duty; but the desperate nature of his scheme for applying a remedy shows that, sacred as the duty may be, it is not one that is likely to be performed. Taking the tenth part of the farmer's cotton, wheat and corn, at a price less than one-seventh of that which these commodities now bring, and making good the exaction, by certificates of exemption from taxation, after the war, may not be exactly the last refuge of the Confederate shysters, but it is certainly a marvelous way of raising the wind. The simple and candid manner in which Mr. TRENHOLM acknowledges that the rebel soldiers are gouged, is certainly more to be admired than DAVIS' preposterous statement that he needs no more money till after the 1st of June 1865. And yet we think TRENHOLM might, in his candid humor, have been even more explicit than he was. The rebel soldier, if he gets all that is promised him, gets a fraction over five dollars a year in money which can be said to be current. Mr. TRENHOLM, therefore, draws no exaggerated picture of the misery entailed on the rank and file of the rebel army when he says that soldiers' families have been the heaviest sufferers by the depreciation of the currency.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONFEDERATE CONFESSIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CONFEDERATE CONFESSIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/48d87c7d-75d7-54cc-a70d-55ece76984b7,560,nyt://article/48d87c7d-75d7-54cc-a70d-55ece76984b7,

The Commission has expended during the past six months over one and a half million dollars, mainly for supplies for our brave soldiers not otherwise attainable. If the Commission could have curtailed the outlay, without running the risk of disappointing the hopes of those who had previously relied upon its succor, it would have done so on grounds of financial prudence.

Soon after the ceremonies were concluded, this young lady retired to her apartment on the fourth floor. In striking a match, a portion of the phosphorus fell upon her light gauze dress, setting it on fire. In great excitement she ran down four flights of stairs, and before assistance could reach her, she was enveloped in flames. She was burned so badly that she died from the effects of her injuries on the following afternoon. An inquest was held by Coroner RANNEY on the same day, but no report was made by him at the Coroner's office until yesterday (Monday) afternoon. No report of the case had been made by the police up to yesterday noon. Deceased was a very estimable young lady, beloved by all who knew her.

Speech at Veteran Union Club,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/15/archives/meeting-of-the-veteran-union-club.html,Speech at Veteran Union Club,"A meeting of the Veteran Union Club was held last evening at Headquarters, No. 243 Eighth-avenue, to celebrate the recent Union victories throughout the country. The hall at an early hour was filled by an audience of ladies and gentlemen, who manifested great enthusiasm during the entire proceedings. The meeting was called to order by the President, Mr. HUGH GARDENER, who introduced as the first speaker, THEODORE TILTON. Mr. TILTON delivered a very able address, in which he referred to the arrival of Gen. BUTLER in this city, and said that those who had predicted war and bloodshed had been sadly disappointed. No country in Europe was as safe in a time of peace as ours during a time of war. He believed that all should now clasp their hands together, and resolve to save our country. Some faces were shadowed while contemplating our taxes. It should be remembered that the people were taxing themselves. The Government must be supported, and although our debt was large one, cotton crop of the South would pay it. We should laugh at debt when the Lord has given us a continent. If JEFF. DAVIS is able to hold the reluctant State of Georgia in subjection, why should we not be able to hold every rebellious State in the Union. The speaker argued at some length the policy of abolishing the Electoral College with a view to a more direct representation of the will of the people. He referred to GARIBALDI as a patriot who did not at first believe the North to be in favor of the abolition of slavery. We should give such noble men to understand that we are determined to put down slavery. The above is but a brief outline of Mr. TILTON's remarks, which were frequently interrupted by applause. After a song by Mr. MATHEW, Mr. MCDOUGALL, CHAS. S. SPENCER, Esq. and Ex-Gov. NOBLE followed in short but eloquent addresses, when the meeting adjourned.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Meeting of the Veteran Union Club.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Meeting of the Veteran Union Club.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-11-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eb5f80e5-4fa9-5111-b408-6f387c62b5f2,325,nyt://article/eb5f80e5-4fa9-5111-b408-6f387c62b5f2,

(Jerrold.); Paris; The Poor of, by Blanchard Jerrold","At the last meeting of the Social Science Congress at York (Eng.), Mr. BLANCHARD JERROLD presented a paper containing observations on some of the plans adopted for the relief of the poor of Paris. He briefly sketched the origin and gradual development of the administration of the Assistance Publique, and showed how, from 1801 down to the present time, improvement had been going on in the manner of administering relief to the poor of the French metropolis. After an interesting description of this system, Mr. JERROLD pointed out that the French system of treating and providing for neglected orphan and deserted children is in all respects unlike the English. The English brigade the little helpless ones, while the Paris Governors of the Poor scatter their proteges far and wide, in the homes of honest, well-conducted working-men. One admirable point in the regulations of the Assistance Publique is that it takes care of the children of poor people, who are laid up in the hospital or committed to prison. If so much is not given in money in Paris as in London, the numbers who are willing to give time and trouble to the poor are greater in Paris. Having dwelt with much emphasis upon the many peculiar and happy phases of French charity, Mr. JERROLD went on to say that the cherishing of home influence, as the best with which poor children can be surrounded, is the main feature of all Paris charities that deal with the young. He believed that the most good could be accomplished if a few among London philanthropists would establish an orphan society, that would possess not one brick in the way of asylum, but that should create a thousand new homes over the country for a thousand of the little Arabs of the streets. He put it as a question of ""drill under a Gothic roof, with a number for a name, or of a new home in a wayside cottage, and farm labor in the fields.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Poor Relief in Paris and in New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Poor Relief in Paris and in New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': ""Children's Aid Society"", 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/145c27c3-d7b5-5e77-aaa1-a7c5233b597b,924,nyt://article/145c27c3-d7b5-5e77-aaa1-a7c5233b597b,

As the American public will doubtless shortly be called on to approve or disapprove of the course pursued by our Government in the matter, it is of the highest importance that there should not be, as there was in the Trent affair, any general misunderstanding as to the law of the matter. It is, therefore, well to say, that the popular impression that a belligerent is under a legal obligation to bring enemy's ships, when captured, before a prize court for condemnation, has, we believe, no foundation either in the books or in usage. Prize courts are instituted for the benefit of neutrals, and the liability of a neutral ship to capture is the question, and the only question, which a belligerent is in any case bound to submit to them. A cruiser is not obliged, by international law, to bring in an enemy's ship for condemnation, unless the ownership is in doubt. If this is the case, her duty is either to submit the point to a prize court, or dismiss the prize. If there is no doubt about it; it the fact that the prize is enemy's property is established beyond question on her capture, either by her papers, or her Master's admission, her destruction on the spot is perfectly justifiable. Moreover, this has been the practice of belligerents in all wars, whenever it was inconvenient for the captor to send his prize into port.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Law in the Florida Case.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Law in the Florida Case.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f0430fb-50de-5cd8-8976-a8eb07e6ded2,648,nyt://article/2f0430fb-50de-5cd8-8976-a8eb07e6ded2,

"Major-General BUTLER left this city at eight o'clock yesterday morning and proceeded to Washington, his staff accompanying him as far as Baltimore. His departure was almost as sudden and un expected as his arrival, but his work here was done and his presence was required in the field. A correct estimate of the importance of the late movement for the protection of the City of New-York cannot be formed without the knowledge of details which the Government at present wisely withholds. The information which led to such energetic action was ample and reliable. A few days before the election the Secretary of War was informed that a secret organization existed in the State of New-York whose avowed object was to accomplish the defeat of the Union ticket by force, if necessary. They had purchased arms in large quantities, and had held secret meetings for the purpose of drill. They had perfected a plan for raising an ???; they were prepared to furnish the mob with implements of war, and to lead them in the struggle. They were as certainly rebels at heart and in intent as the hordes of Las or the murdering bands of MOSBY. Taking this definite information in connection with the known fact that the City of New-York contains to-day fifteen thousand Southern rebels, too slothful and cowardly to brave the dangers and fatigue of the battle-field, but vindictive and revengeful enough to pay the hire of incendiaries and assassins, the Government did not feel justified in neglectlng the warning. The opposition press have universally ascribed the riots of July to the absence of all military forces from the city. That riot cost the City of New-York twelve hundred lives and millions of dollars; it is a sore that cannot be cured. The Government decided this time to apply the ""ounce of prevention."" On the 3d of November, Gen. BUTLER received an order directing him to proceed to New-York and take command of such troops as might be ordered to report to him there. In twelve hours the General was here, and had established his headquarters at the Hoffman House. In forty-eight hours a provisioned army corps was transferred from the banks of the James to the Hudson. It was an organized army in every respect, complete, with the proper proportion of cavalry and artillery, and composed of veteran troops selected for special service. That portion Intended for service in this city, was temporarlly encamped on Staten Island and at Fort Hamilton. Gen. BUTLER then devoted the days intervening before election to making h imself acquainted with the city, with its police arrangements, and with the means at hand to preserve order. Maps were studied, the Superintendent and Commissioners of police were consulted, and plans perfected. Telegraphic communication was established between his headquarters and every part of the city. Trustworthy commissioned officers were detailed to remain at each police station-house, and a special bureau of information organised. An engineer department was created, and a system of barricades agreed upon by which a riot might be confined to the part of the city in which it first broke out. But one chief point was never lost sight of. It was necessary that no excuse should be offered to the enemies of the Government for raising the cry of "" armed interference with the freedom of the ballot-box."" This part of the movement was executed in a signally successful manner. On the morning of the 8th of November, the City of New-York was surrounded by a cordon of soldlers in arms, yet not an armed man was visible. Horses were harnessed to the guns, and flying artillery could have been whirled through the streets to any point at a moment's notice, yet no one saw them or knew where they were located. It was this mysterious presence of a force felt but not seen that so awed the Southern rebels in New-York that, to use the language of the General himself in answer to a question as to future disturbances, ""Truth crushed to earth may rise again, but they never will."" The troops maintained their stations until Friday night, when they all returned to their camps on Staten Island, and yesterday the last company of them left the harbor of New-York on their way to the James, and thus ended the movement on the part of the Government for the protection of New-York from the horrors of riot and bloodshed.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/16/archives/gen-butlers-departure-what-was-done-to-protect-the-city-on-the-8th.html,,"Major-General BUTLER left this city at eight o'clock yesterday morning and proceeded to Washington, his staff accompanying him as far as Baltimore.

During the past month we have had them at the rate of about three a week. The list is headed by the accident on the Harlem Road, which occurred in the heart of the City of New-York on the 10th of October. The train which was then amashed up contained, a large number of soldiers. The train which, five days later, ran off the track on the Shore Line Road, also had soldiers on board -- two hundred and seventy-five sick and wounded. The fearful collision on the Lafayette and Indianapolis Railroad on the 1st inst., was marked by the same coincidence. Soldiers and members of the Sanitary Commission were on board. Two accidents on the Baltimore and Philadelphia Road, on the day of the Presidential election, were similarly distinguished by the live freight they carried. We do not presume to say that there was any rebel plot or conspiracy in these cases. But the coincidence is noteworthy. Half a score of such disasters inside of a period of less than thirty days is too much to make railroad travel an agreeable recreation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/953a2152-9dd2-5730-bf60-70c7bbed2005,519,nyt://article/953a2152-9dd2-5730-bf60-70c7bbed2005,

Speech on Amnesty or Subjugation,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/16/archives/the-immediate-future.html,Speech on Amnesty or Subjugation,"Gen. BUTLER's remarks at the Fifth-avenue Hotel on Monday evening will attract attention, -- not only on account of the quarter from whence they come, but from the nature of the suggestions which they make. The General sees in the result of the Presidential election, what all the world will recognize, a declaration, made with overwhelming unanimity by the American people, that this rebellion must be put down by force, so long as it remains in arms against the Government. To this the whole country now stands pledged, -- and neither Southern rebels nor their sympathizers abroad or at home, can any longer cherish doubts, or be misled by illusions on that subject. Gen. BUTLER thinks the present, therefore, a good time to make a full and formal tender of the olive branch, -- inviting all who are now in rebellion to cease fighting, and return to the Union, and promising all, leaders as well as followers, full and complete amnesty for their crimes. He urges that practical wisdom would suggest such a course, and that we are now strong enough in every respect, moral and material, to afford it. The General suggests further that some day be fixed as the limit of this offer, and that if be not accepted within that time, the war be then prosecuted openly and avowedly for the subjugation of the rebels and the confiscation of their lands to the soldiers of our armies. He vindicates the essential justice of this proposition by historical precedents, and presses it as the surest means of bringing the war to a successful close.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Immediate Future', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Immediate Future', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d4aa2f5-3653-5c92-9b27-c966cb15a536,334,nyt://article/9d4aa2f5-3653-5c92-9b27-c966cb15a536,

After complimenting Col.CRANE, the host of the occasion, for the ability and efficiency with which his department was administered, he spoke of the aristocracy of Nashville. They had ever been, and were to-day, rebels at heart, and in deed also, when they dared do anything for the rebel cause, He knew thereef he affirmed. They had misrepresented and villfied him because he had been true to the Union. Copperhead papers and speakers at the North had charged him with selfish motives in the course he had pursued. If losing all his negroes, if being robbed of $40,000 in bonds, if sacrificing all that he had to sacrifice, was selfishness, then he had been selfish. But the Government had been sustained in all its integrity, and he was more than recompensed. He had always been a Democrat, but in true sense. True Democracy meant the elevation of the masses. He was a Democrat, but at the same time an aristocrat; but his aristocracy was the aristocracy of labor, the men whose, brains and muscles had planned and wronght out those great achievement that had made the laboring classes of America the true chivalry of the world. The men who sneered at ""greasy mecha???ics' and ""small-fisted farmers"" as the mud???s of society."" were the very men who had not brains to conceive or ability to execute a plan. Labor was dignity, dignity is manhood, and manhood was aristocracy. Society was to-day in a chaotic state.

This, we confess, is not altogether unexpected intelligence. And yet we doubt whether the court will not find, that in giving this decision, it is opening up new complications, in the affair, foreign altogether to the issue presented to it. If YOUNG's commission is to determine the belligerent character of the prisoners, that commission will neither be confirmed nor invalidated by any evidence taken in Richmond -- even if the prisoners' counsel find the means of communicating with that city. Judge COURSOL, at least, must have been aware that neither YOUNG nor YOUNG's agents have any certain means of getting the required evidence within a month, or even within six months. It is, in fact, simply trifling with the matter to issue this commission for proving YOUNG to be what he claims.

It truly was a grand exemplification of the vigor of the republican principle. But what is grander yet, is the cheerful submission universally manifested in the result of that election. It might be said by the enemies of our institutions, that the peaceful course of the canvass was owing to the expectation of each party that the result would be in its favor -- that so long as there was a belief by each that success would come to it without disorder, there could be no object in disorder. But no such pretext can be used to detract from the moral worth of this universal acquiescence in the result actually consummated and settled. This acquiescence stands out before the world in unimpeachable majesty. For two months before the election, political excitement raged almost like a tempest. Issues of the most tremendous magnitude were opposed, which the great body of both parties honestly believed involved the very fate of the country. Every motive and passion that can rouse human nature to intensity of action, were in full play. A spectator from abroad would have imagined that all this fierce stir must end in some dreadful convulsion. And yet here we all are as tranquil as if it all passed a hundred years ago.

Dinner for Soldiers and Sailors,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/19/archives/the-soldiers-and-sailors-thanksgiving-dinner.html,Dinner for Soldiers and Sailors,"-The movement to furnish a Thanksgiving dinner to our soldiers and sailors, of which a full account is given in another column, has proved a great success. No extraordinary measures have been taken to give publicity to the project. There have been no appeals to contribute to the dinner fund. And yet, within less than three weeks, the sum of nearly fifty thousand dollars has been sent to the committee in this city having the matter in charge, to be appropriated to the purchase of turkeys for the army and navy. This free-will offering is all the more gratifying and touching from the fact that, while our men of wealth have subscribed liberally, a very large proportion of the dinner fund has been contributed in small sums by persons whose hearts were far more liberal than their purses could afford to be -- wives, mothers, children of soldiers now in the field, or who have given their lives for their country, -- returned veterans who know how gratefully such a practical remembrance will be received by their old comrades -- old men, who remember the first war for liberty in America, and hope to see the present one end as happily. The heart of the people is with the soldiers; and thousands of families will next Thursday eat their Thanksgiving turkey with a double relish, as they think of the gallant fellows who sent EARLY ""whirling through Winchester,"" and who keep LEE pent up in Richmond, enjoying a real old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner in their camps.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' THANKSGIVING; DINNER."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' THANKSGIVING; DINNER."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Thanksgiving', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2df8e56-72b5-5c60-9009-23561b5c1611,255,nyt://article/d2df8e56-72b5-5c60-9009-23561b5c1611,

The different denominations were far from being easily distinguishable from the notes being of one size. The gilding on the notes was tawdry, and conceived in execrable taste. The engraving was good; but except to a keen and practiced eye it presented few points not easily susceptible of imitation. The vast herd of untutored manipulators could readily be deceived by a scurvy counterfeit of it. In short it has served its turn, and only served it indifferently well. It should be called in without delay, and we should have something better in its stead. The fifty-cent notes are counterfeited to an extent which it is impossible to estimate. The city is at this moment flooded by them. Scores of groggeries and policy shops act as distributing agencies for them. They are found fresh from the printer, circulating all round town; and it seems that the police and the detectives are utterly powerless to stop their increase. If nothing better can be devised, a return to the first issue would be vastly preferable to what now chiefly circulates. The issuing Department should at least see to it that the various denominations are distinguishable by the size as well as the color of the notes; that good substantial paper, with no guilding to it, is used, and that there is altogether less facility for counterfeiting the thing than exists at present.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRACTIONAL CURRENCY AND ITS COUNTERFEITS.; TERFEITS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FRACTIONAL CURRENCY AND ITS COUNTERFEITS.; TERFEITS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COUNTERFEITING', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dd05af84-8477-594f-99df-c50ce16fc109,420,nyt://article/dd05af84-8477-594f-99df-c50ce16fc109,

PETERSON, having disguised himself, and having succeeded in passing the sentinels on the posts above-named between 6 and 7 o'clock, made his way into the employe's mess-room. Here he is supposed to have found an iron chisel, left in the room by the gas-fiters, with which he broke open the door of the mess-room, which enabled him to cross the passage to the female department. In the passage-way he picked the lock and forced off the wooden braces (which were deemed sufficient to prevent escape). This enabled PETERSON to enter the store-room of the prison.

We regret that domestic affliction is the cause of the correspondent's leaving. But we doubt whether his countrymen either here or in England have much to lose, if his retirement from the post of correspondent should even prove to be permanent. No doubt, he has amused a large class in England, who relish wit, even if it is coarse, and who revel in caricatures of foreign communities, however broad and base may be their character. But when this is said, all that can honestly be claimed for Mr. SALA has been uttered. So far from his having contributed in any degree to the spread of correct intelligence among his countrymen respecting the causes, the progress, or the scope of this rebellion, he has from the first maliciously distorted whatever facts were put within his reach to serve a partisan purpose, or to gratify his overpowering appetite for travesty. His journal, the Telegraph, is a ???gnized mouthpiece of the rebel clique in London. It is a cheap, piquant, unscrupulous print, deriving its prime sustenance from the demimonde of Cockneydom. Fancy portraits of fast women, juicy reports of indecent trials before the Courts, and correspondence in the style of Sala, together with a free allowance of loud and vituperative editorial comment, have made the paper great in circulation.

Report Ordered on Help by the Gods to Government of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/20/archives/foreign-items.html,Report Ordered on Help by the Gods to Government of,"-- Capt. BEECHER has compiled within the last ten years the following curious voyages of bottles thrown into the sea by unfortunate navigators. A good many bottles cast into the sea next to the African coast, found their way to Europe. One bottle seems to have anticipated the Panama route, having traveled from the Panama Isthmus to the Irish coast. Another crossed the Atlantic from the Canaries to Nova-Scotia. Three or four bottles thrown into the sea by Greenland mariners off Davis' Straits, landed on the northwest coast of Ireland. Another made a curious trip -- swam from the South Atlantic Ocean to the west coast of Africa, passing Gibraltar, went along the Portuguese coast of France, and was finally picked up on Jersey Island. One bottle was found after sixteen years' swimming, one after fourteen years, and two after ten years. A few only traveled more than one year, and one only five days. This was sent off by the Captain of the Racehorse, on the 17th of April, in the Carribean Sea, and was found on the 228, after having gone through three degrees of longitude (210 miles,) western direction. Captain M'CLURE. of the Investigato, threw a bottle into the sea in 1850, on his voyage to Behring's Straits. It swam 3,500 miles in 200 days, and was picked up on the Honduras coast.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b98f194a-7415-5935-8625-de3765283359,1482,nyt://article/b98f194a-7415-5935-8625-de3765283359,

That body, though specially elected to frame a new Constitution for the Kingdom, seemed in no haste to terminate their labors, and lay down their authority. The Hellenic Senate indeed was abolished under pretence that its existence was unnecessary, but the edifice of the Constitution was still very far from being complete. For nearly twelve months the young King GEORGE contemplated the dilatory proceedings of the assembly with Christian resignation. At length, however, even his patience gave way, and he addressed to the popular representatives a message in which, after censuring their past conduct, and expressing his determination to submit to it no longer, he coolly informs them that he has transmitted to the Chamber a draft of so much of the Constitution as they had neglected to prepare, to which he requires their assent within a period of ten days.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Greece and its King.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Greece and its King.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Greece', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c25438c5-d9cc-51f1-9689-afebff507163,552,nyt://article/c25438c5-d9cc-51f1-9689-afebff507163,

"Horsfall's,Miss,Notorious Adventuress",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/20/archives/a-matrimonial-adventure-with-miss-horsfall.html,"Horsfall's,Miss,Notorious Adventuress","The Sheffield Independent gives a curious history of an engagement for marriage entered into by a young gentleman with the notorious ""Miss HORSFALL,"" a smart young lady who pretended to be the niece of Mr. HORSFALL, M.P., and who managed in that character to swindle numerous tradespeople, who have obtained her committal to the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court on three distinct charges of embezzlement. ""Shortly before this accomplished swindler commenced practising on the too susceptible shopkeepers in the neighborhood of Greenwich,"" says the Independent,"" she had been honoring Birmingham with a visit. As Miss HORSFALL, the reputed niece of the rich member for Liverpool, she found no difficulty in obtaining jewels, dresses, and other costly articles, such as a young heiress with expensive tastes might be supposed to require; and by dealings with her 'uncle' -- not the one whose name she bore but an accommodating relation with a hooked nose, who sports the sign of the Three Balls -- she raised enough money to carry on her game, and keep up a lady like appearance. This was the state of things when a young gentleman from Birmingham arrived on a periodical visit to Leeds, and took up temporary quarters at the same hotel in which Miss HORSFALL was residing. This young gentleman (whom we shall call FRANK, for the sufficient reason that FRANK is not his name) was traveling on a business tour for his father, who is one of the most respectable of our local manufacturers, following a line of business and residing in a suburb of Birmingham, FRANK saw and admired the charming MARY, who seemed to occupy a position in the hotel between that of a friend and a guest, and whose profuse liberality and condescending manners, added to her reputation of great wealthiness, made her an object of no little regard. FRANK found her affable, genial, and communicative; he had frequent opportunities of meeting her. and, to make a long story short, he fell in love with her. Nor was he doomed to despair, for the fair one confessed her preference for the ardent youth, and the upshot was that they were engaged to be married. By telling a story made up of the most flagrant untruths, this woman imposed upon a family who bear a high reputation for strictest integrity and whose natural love or truth may have disinclined them to distrust; while by simultaneously pursuing a secret course of swindling she was able to maintain her position in the eyes of those whom she had so impudently imposed, upon. Miss HORSFALL came to Birmingham as the affianced wife of FRANK, and was received by his family in that capacity. Her conduct was not in every respect satisfactory, but the minds of those disposed to believe the best are easily satisfied, and as Miss HORSFALL added hypocrisy in religious affairs to her other fatal accomplishments, she managed to avoid detection for a time The period for the wedding was fixed, and a house near the town was taken for the young couple to reside in. This house Miss HORSFALL undertook to furnish from her own private resources; and she proceeded to carry out that undertaking in a style which showed that her ""resources"" were as large as her tastes were extravagant. Tradesmen in London sent down furniture worth hundreds of pounds to order. There were four or five piano-fortes from different makers; chairs worth ten or twelve pounds each, much too good to sit upon; cushions to cover them, also too, valuable for ordinary use; carpets, tables and household ""fixings"" of all kinds, in all the same grand style. The stable had to be enlarged to make room for the splendid carriage horses sent down from London, and special provision had to be made for the smart groom who came to tend them. While all these preparations were in progress Miss HORSFALL was the guest of the family of which, according to the pro-programme, she was soon to be a cherished member; and she endeavored to show her gratitude for the kindness of her new found friends by loading them with costly presents. She was lavish with her wealth, and even tried to mix herself up with the business affairs of her dear papa that was to be. She offered FRANK's father the use of certain loose thousands belonging to her if he chose to accept them: but the offer was declined, or ""dear papa"" might have been wheedled out of promissory notes in advance, and have found them converted into hard cash, for which he would have been liable. The mechanism of Miss HORSFALL's daring scheme appeared to work admirably. As the wife of an honest and respectable man, whose name she might legally bear in any contingency, she would better face the exposure that was bound to come some day, even if her new connections could have been prevailed upon to avoid public scandal by settling with her dupes, or perhaps the bold adventuress really loved this young man, and was impelled by resistless passion, regardles or reckless of consequences. Whatever her motives or expectations, she was anxious to get married as quickly as possible, anxious to spend as much time as possible in the society of her intended husband, and anxious to stand well with his relatives. But though, as we have said, the mechanism appeared to work well. there was a screw loose somewhere. FRANK was not altogether satisfied with his bargain, and the evasion of his inquiries made him more determined to have all mystery cleared up with respect to the woman whom he was about to mary. The required explanations were not forthcoming, the plot thickened; the doubts in the young man's mind deepened into certainty -- and the match was broken off. The resolve once made, it was firmly adhered to. All the arts of a passionate and desperate woman were exercised in vain. The heart that had proved so soft and pliant at Leeds was hard and film as adamant at Birmingham; and the adventuress even though she urged that she could not survive the separation for three hours, was rejected by the man who had loved her. That the shock did not prove fatal, is established by the fact that Miss HORSFALL now lies in fall, awaring her trial now three charges of embozzlement. We believe that the family who have suffered so much annoyance by her perfidy have acted most honorably all through the matter, even to the assumption of liabilities they were not bound to undertake. Even since her imprisonment. Miss HORSFALL has written to the family of her intended husband, imploring a continuation of their friendship in her trouble, and making violent professions of religious sentiment, which we hope, rather than believe, to be the result of sincere repentance.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A MATRIMONIAL ADVENTURE WITH MISS HORSFALL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A MATRIMONIAL ADVENTURE WITH MISS HORSFALL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e75c31d0-ec99-579d-b361-9708400d2e10,1140,nyt://article/e75c31d0-ec99-579d-b361-9708400d2e10,

Her inventor, Chief-Engineer W.W.W. WOOD, Capts. WORDEN and BOGGS, and the engine builders, were the only persons present, as it is desired that the invention shall be kept a secret for a time at least. She left the Batrery yard of Messrs. SECOR & Co., at Jersey City, and proceeded up the North River, in company with Picket-boat No. 6, which also was making her first trial trip. Both vessels steamed along easily, attracting much attention from passing vessels and the passengers on the ferry-boats. Experiments were made in detaching torpedoes and in manoeuvering the vessels in a variety of ways, but with the severest tests the vessels worked to the satisfaction of all concerned. The speed of the Stromboli under easy steam, and while submerged, as if in action, was about eight knots, and with the power she can develop, could have been run up to ten knots. Picket-boat No. 6 made nine knots easily. As we have described in detail the construction of the vessels within the past few days, we do not deem it necessary to repeat it at this time. The following is a list of the officers of the Stromboli: First-Assistant JOHN L. LAY, Commanding; Second-Assistant-Engineers, CHAS. H. STONE, J.B. CHADWICK, JOHN SMITH; Third Assistant-Engineer BYRON S. HEATH. The Stromboli will sail in a few hours for very important service. The officers of this vessel have received their appointments to thi vessel, with the understanding that if it should become a military necessity to destroy the vessel to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy, they perish with her.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da6f35b3-a003-5c94-a576-67a6b3b968f1,2323,nyt://article/da6f35b3-a003-5c94-a576-67a6b3b968f1,

A million would have been a cheap price to pay for the fresh courage and hearty cheer with which this pleasant and timely gift will inspire the hearts of our brave soldiers.

The plot, though concocted in the Southern Confederacy, and having its base at Havana, was addressed only to the Pacific. With good luck, HOGG might have captured three or four of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's vessels, before discovery, beside two of the Panama Railroad Company's ships plying to Central American ports, and then running over toward the Sandwich Islands, might have inflicted serious damage on sailing commercial vessels; and thence proceeded to the north coast of California and the west of Oregon, and destroyed one or two ships of Charlady's line.

On Confederacy a mere Shell,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/22/archives/gen-grant-in-newyork-his-presence-at-the-fenton-reception-on.html,On Confederacy a mere Shell,"Lieut.-Gen. GRANT arrived in this city from the front on Saturday afternoon, and took rooms at the Astor House, where he was joined by Mrs. GRANT and his two sons. His business in New-York was entirely of a private nature, and he therefore sent a personal request to the City Press that no mention, either editorially or otherwise, should then be made of his presence here. In compliance with his wishes the papers universally refrained from any allusion to his movements, and even the ovation he received, at the Fenton reception on Saturday evening, was passed by in silence. At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon the General left the Astor House, and took the cars for Baltimore, en route to City Point, where he will doubtless be found at his headquarters to-night. When the Veteran Union Club complimented the Governor elect with a serenade, they little thought what a distinguished guest would grace the occasion with his presence. It was only after much solicitation that Gen. GRANT consented to come down to the receptio-room, and occupy a seat by the side of Gov. FENTON. His entrance was greeted with a shout of applause, bursting out from the heart of every man there present, the homage of the people to their great victorious leader. No words can express the wild enthusiasm of the moment when cheers for GRANT rang from floor to ceiling, and the audience looked upon that modest, unassuming man, whom half the continent fears and the other half adores. He positively refused to speak although repeatedly called upon. Voices in the crowd called out ""Rise up, General, we want to see you."" The General rose, bowed and sat down amid cries from all parts of the room, of ""God bless you, General, God bless you."" To Gen. SICKLES, he delegated the honor of returning his thanks for his flattering reception. His reticence on this occasion, his resistance to the inducement to say at least a few words, was but an illustration of the obstinate firmness of his character, which, having once determined to do or not to do a thing, will not allow him to deviate from his purpose. The General received very few visitors during his stay in the city. On Sunday evening he called on Lieut.-Gen. SCOTT, at the Hoffman House, but it is believed to have been nothing more than an unofficial visit of courtesy. To those whom he honored by receiving them at his rooms, his manner was cheerful, his conversation hopeful, and his views of the situation most assuring. No one can hear him talk without being profoundly impressed with the force of a character combining immense power with the most unassuming modesty. His presence fascinates, his eye magnetizes you, and you cannot look in his face, listen to his few calm, quiet words, and go away doubling that GRANT is master of the situation, and knows it. To a gentleman of this city he said, on Sunday afternoon: ""The Southern Confederacy is a mere shell. I know it. I am sure of it. It is a hollow shell, and SHERMAN will prove it to you."" The calm, modest consciousness of power with which this was said, more than the words themselves, conveyed to his visitor an unqualified conviction of the truth of the General's remarks. In answer to a question whether, in his opinion, ninety days would bring the end, he said, with a grim smile: ""I am not a ninety-day man, but we shall see what will happen in six months."" The significance of these words from the Commander-in-Chief of our armies, with the sense of his knowledge of and power over the whole subject, which his manner imports, cannot be underrated. Gen. GRANT knows and believes what he says, and he is not accustomed to express his views without due consideration. From the movement of Gen. SHERMAN it is evident he expects great results, and in the success of his operations he has the most perfect confidence. Although few had the pleasure of seeing him, yet he so impressed those few with his own hopefulness that they cannot help reiterating the cry of the Veteran Union Club and the prayer of all loyal men, ""God bless you. General; God bless you!""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEN.

SEMMES provided for this retreat when he got a pleasure yacht to act as tender for him before accepting Capt. WINSLOW's challenge. All that escaped of his crew instantly took passage for Southampton.

The latter stoutly resisted the officer with his knife, and but for the timely and vlgorous use of the club, the officer would no doubt have shared the fate of the two CODYS.

At that time we could, as a nation, boast of, perhaps, the finest body of shipmasters and officers in the world; men of education, of practical ability and of great value to our merchants. The best ships afloat were commanded by these gentlemen, a majority of whom combined the qualities of excellent navigators with commercial business talents. Many of them have been connected with our navy since the first blockade was established, up to the present time; and by their signal bravery, good judgment and officer-like qualifications, have risen in rank to the full limit of the existing laws of the Navy Department, while in the estimation of their brother officers, and the country at large, they have won for themselves an honorable and enduring fame.

From Clare's testimony, taken in court, it appears that on Monday night last he was walking up Broadway in pursuit of some of the attractions which this great city affords, when be came across a policeman whom he asked if he could direct him to a gamb ling-house where they played the game of"" faro."" The policeman said there were quite a number of that class of houses in that vicinity on Broadway, and that he could point bim to one which he thought would just suit Mr. Clark. He accord ingly pointed out to him the premises No. 663 Broad way, and told him to go up on the second floor and he would find a "" laro"" table and some one to play with him. Clark went there and found four or five men engaged in the above game around a table, Harris it seems was dealer, a man whose name is given as Richard ROE was game-keeper, Samuel Jones was looker out, Henry Blackman, above-named, was th man to receive the guests. He received Clark very politely, and cordially offered Clark his seat at the table. Clark took the seat, and in a very short time he was $845 poorer than when he entered. Officer GAFFNEY of the Fifteenth Precinct, succeeded yesterday in securing Harris and Blackman. The former was held for trial by Justice DODGE in the sum of $500 bail, and the latter was required to give bail to appear as a witness.

There is at this date remaining on board 906 men available for draft, and the average number daity received is 30, the majority of whom are substitutes. One most excellent arrangement has been made on board this ship, which it would be well for other captains in our navy to imitate. It is this: In order to obviate the great difficulty heretofore existing on board receiving-ships, and which has caused so much suffering to the families of persons joining the navy -- the want of a reliable party to receive and forward moneys, and the want of which has caused so mamy complaints of thieving, gambling and other frauds -- all recruits have been afforded the opportunity of sending their money to their friends, through Westcott's Express, and as an evidence of the very general appreciation of this arrangement, It may be weil to state that upwards of $350,00U has been received and promptly delivered by the agent of the Express Company, whose office has become one of the institutions of this ship.

He held that position for four years, and it was in the last year of his term that the Quarantine riots occurred, in which he was a sufferer -- his house having been burned by the rioters, with all its contents, and his family narrowly escaping with their lives. In 1858 Dr. THOMPSON removed to Brooklyn, and interested himself in various measures of public improvement; becoming President of the Brooklyn Central and Jamaica Railroad and Park Commissioner, and finally was appointed Quarantine Commissioner in 1863, to protect and represent the interests of the City of Brooklyn. To his skill as a physician and his executive talent, the port of New-York is largely indebted for its present immunity from the epidemics incident to emigration and foreign commerce.

It seems that there is other Georgia news beside this at Richmond, but the rebels say they do not mean to gratify us by telling it. We are grateful to them for even this unkind remark, however, as we are able to infer from it that the news which they are holding back is such news as would afford us gratification. Who can tell what it may be.? Perhaps SHERMAN has overwhelmed the immense COBB, and his doughty militia, that marched boldly forth to confront the Union hosts. Perhaps he has had peace propositions for the stiffnecked GOV. BROWN. Perhaps he has compelled the Georgia legislators whom he captured to hold a special session, take the oath of allegiance and repeal the ordinance of Secession.

Influence of the War World-wide,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/24/archives/bearings-of-the-war.html,Influence of the War World-wide,"We are apt, in this great war, to lose sight sometimes of its world-wide bearings, and its influence upon the permanent history of man. It touches so closely our present feelings and interests, and our whole daily life, that we are apt to view it only in these relations. Friendly and intelligent observers in other countries, viewing the strife at a distance, see its great and permanent significance more clearly than we do. This has appeared in many of the utterances of such men as GASPARIN, GOLDWIN SMITH and GARIBALDI. The last named friend of liberty has written a brief note from Caprera, correcting certain statements to the effect that he had become antagonistic to the cause of the Union. He says he considers the American [???] to be one ""affecting all mankind,"" and exclaims: ""Woe to the world if the North do not come out victorious from this struggle."" It is thus that our cause appears abroad, and thus that it will appear to the generations who shall come after us in this country. The words that ROBERT HALL used to the English people during the Napoleonic wars may well be applied to the people of this nation now: ""As far as the interests of freedom are concerned,"" said he, ""the most important by far, of sublunary interests you, my countrymen, stand in the capacity of the federal representatives of the human race; for with you it is to determine (under God) in what condition the latest posterity shall be born; their fortunes are intrusted to your care, and on your conduct at this moment depends the color and complexion of their destiny. If liberty, after being extinguished on the continent of Europe, is suffered to expire here, whence is it ever to emerge in the midst of that thick night that will invest it?""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEARINGS OF THE WAR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BEARINGS OF THE WAR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b476e072-8f7e-59a0-b72c-f0e689d55caf,306,nyt://article/b476e072-8f7e-59a0-b72c-f0e689d55caf,

DREW is charged, in the Havana letter which we publish this morning, with knowledge of the piratical scheme for the capture of his vessel. We were the first to point out that the circumstances under which BRAINE and his associates got on board the Roanoke in Havana harbor were exceedingly suspicious. We threw no imputation upon Capt. DREW, but it has now become imperative that he should have an opportunity of proving his innocence, by a judicial trial in some form.

Lady on","A letter has been published, purporting to come from a lady in Louisiana, on Gen. BANKS' system of free labor, and attempting to prove it a failure, by setting forth the insubordination of the negro servants, the small result of their labor as compared with that of whites, their inability to comprehend the nature of contracts, and so on. The letter, in short, is precisely such a one as an Irish landlord of the old school will write at this day about Irish servants and peasantry; as the French aristocracy were in the habit of writing about their tenantry; and as Russian nobles write about their serfs. Every vice which the ex-slaveholder of Louisiana charges against the negroes, as something peculiar to people of their race, may be found ascribed to any white race which has been long in a condition of servitude or degradation, in any modern work which treats of their character. Lying, stealing, carelessness, indolence, are the vices of the slave everywhere, and not alone in America; and they disappear as his condition improves. No man who has never seen his rights respected by others, will ever respect theirs. No man will ever tell the truth who has no means of protecting himself from violence but falsehood and fraud. No man will ever respect property who has never had any, and has lived long with the knowledge that he never can acquire any. No man will ever feel a strong respect for the family tie who has never had a home, and has been bred in the belief that he can never have any better claim to wife or children than if he were an ox or an ass. No man ever yet retained or acquired a sense of honor with the marks of a whip on his back. How can they respect themselves whom nobody else respects? These things are true of all races.

The opera is entirely new to our public -- a fact which is the more remarkable, in as much as it is the latest and best work of a composer whose other productions are held in high esteem with us. Nearly twenty years have elapsed since SCRIBE's excellent story of the unfortunate King of Portugal was set to music by DONIZETTI. It was intended for Parisians, and was produced in the gay metropolis with great splendor. At first it did not enjoy a Very extended popularity. The Court was in mourning for the Duke of ORLEANS, who had been thrown from his carriage and killed. Fashionable pleasures were, for a time, forgotten in a grief that was almost universal. Subsequently, ""Don Sebastian"" was revived with eclat, and has ever since been regarded as the masterpiece of its composer. A very short inquiry will explain why it has not been produced here. The work is long, and constructed on the largest plan of the French stage. There are five acts and as many situations. A very heavy expenditure has to be encountered before it can be submitted to the public at all, and no one has felt disposed to run the risk of such a venture, even if any have had the ability to make it. A combination of happy circumstances has induced Mr. MARETZEK to undertake the task, and ""Don Sebastian"" must now be added to that long list of operas which he has been the first to introduce to our public, and which, with one or two exceptions, constitutes the entire repertoire of our opera-house.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-11-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a57f39cc-cf95-59df-af9b-e813e3dd9915,1426,nyt://article/a57f39cc-cf95-59df-af9b-e813e3dd9915,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/27/archives/sermon-of-rev-dr-thompson.html,,"Rev. Dr. THOMPSON took for his text Third Ecclesiastes, verse three: ""There is a time to break down, and a time to build up."" He proposed to con sider whether it is not possible to build a nation so that it shall stand. Lord BACON marks the degrees of honor in a State, viz: Founders, saviors and defenders, and in the last place fathers of their country. Founders of States are sometimes unconscious in their work. They settle in a new soil, and then grow in to great cities, & c., and the founders do not know how. The Plymouth children joined to build a Stale before they built houses, When they landed at Andover they declared a State. Man is distinguished from the animal, Inasmuch as he is a moral and political being. He is social. These forty-one Pilgrims created a State and founded a State lasting as time. He recited the preamble of the foundation of the colony of Massachusetts. That simple declaration is the great charter of freedom for all on this continent. There the nation began; coining to America planted a colony under a patent, they founded a nation on principle. These were the first founders whom BACON described. It was then given for the second founders to propagate what had been done by the first founders. It was given thorn to harmonize this gift of independence with order. It is next given to us as restorers and fathers, who, by ruling justly, making the times great. We may a scribe to us another distinction, those who fight for the country. And when faction and treason has built up in the land, and when it said it is time to break down this temple of liberty, it is given us to rebuild this great and grand edifice. It is ordered that this temple shall not be be broke down, but it is the time to break down this Confederacy of treason and conspirators. The speaker said that society is founded on family. All society had its origin there. A true society is not an artificial compact. He then referred to PLATO's several definitions of man, and showed their application. The said society is not merely a conglomeration of individuals who form a Government to rule over them. Man has not alone rights, but, du[???]es. Wherever one has rights, he has duties, slavery cuts at the root of society, and by severing the family He of the nation, slavery strips the man of wife and children, and thus society, which is founded on family, becomes destroyed. Equally destructive is the monopoly of land by the aristocracy. In the South, there is a concentration of large acres of land in the hands of few proprietors. In New-York, each farm averages a little over a hundred; in Virginia the average farm is over three hundred acres; in South Carolina five hundred and ninety-nine; and so on through the South. Thus the body of the laboring population are precluded from an ownerse[???]p in the soil, Hence that pestiferous designation of ""poor whites."" England is falling into this evil. The tenants are there worse off than the people were under the feudal system. Society is thus made up of two extremes -- the owning and the owned. No nation can land permanently which is builded on a landed aristocracy. The grand hope of this nation lies in the Homestead Act. This, with the confiscation of the estates of the rebels of the South, will cause the nation to take deep root and fill the land. The patriotic poet of the nation will yet live to see his prophetic vision fulfilled when free homes take the place of slave plantations. The history of land is the history of races. Every where do we find in a nation that has rooted itself in history a race. The nation must grow by assimilation. The natural structure must be strong enough to bear the weight of foreign elements.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sermon of Rev.

"If the vote polled at the late Presidential election in Philadelphia be any criterion of the population, our city has increased materially during the progress of the war.

At the Presidential election this year we polled 99,800 votes, and at the ratio as in 1860 ought therefore to have 686,404 inhabitants. Another test is afforded by the total number of regular and extra, which this year foot up about 129,000. Calculating the taxables to be in the usual average of one in every five and a half of the population, this would give us now about 709,500 inhabitants.

The redoubtable HOWELL COBB and his militia had taken refuge behind the fortifications of the place, and every person capable of bearing arms had been ordered out under penalty of arrest. But SHERMAN, declining the risk of a delay of one or two days, and the necessary expenditure of ammunition for the capture of a city he would not hold, has deliberately moved by, leaving COBB in his rear to scratch his head and thank his stars for having escaped demolition. The Richmond Dispatch of the 24th says one column of troops followed the line of the Georgia Railroad sixty-seven miles east of Atlanta, and then struck off due South for Milledgeville. This column had already reached Eatonton, the terminus of the railroad running off from the Georgia Central through Milledgeville, and only 25 miles north-west from the latter city. The other column, headed by SHERMAN in person, followed down the line of the railroad leading to Macon as far as Gr[???], sixty-eight miles from Atlanta and forty-three from Macon, and then struck off southeast to Gordon, located twenty miles east of Macon on the Georgia Central Road, at the point where it is intersected by the Milledgeville Road. Thus Macon was cut off from communication eastward, and the announcement of its capture could not reach Richmond even if made. At Gordon SHERMAN was attacked by WHEELER's cavalry, but without success. From Gordon below and Eatonton above the Federal columns were moving on Milledgeville in conjunction, leaving no avenue of escape for the citizens and others except on foot eastward. The Legislature and Methodist Conference, both in session there, had hastily absconded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-11-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3529873b-d423-594a-9097-75907318788f,834,nyt://article/3529873b-d423-594a-9097-75907318788f,

Rochdale (Eng) Cooperative Union; Cooperative Societies and Trade Monopolies,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/27/archives/the-industrious-poor-and-trading-monopolies.html,Rochdale (Eng) Cooperative Union; Cooperative Societies and Trade Monopolies,"We have negative evidence that sharp and biting want has never yet overtaken any large portion of our industrious poor for a long continuous period, in the fact that cooperative trading societies, such as have been in existence in England and Scotland for over a quarter of a century, have never yet become, as it were, an established institution among us. There are one or two in operation in the manufacturing districts of New-England. But these were put in operation quite as much from the taste which the operatives had acquired for experiments in social science, as from any immediate pressure of need on the part of the associates. The Rochdale Cooperative Union, which was, we believe, the pioneer institution in England was, on the other hand, the offspring mainly of a stern necessity. The workers in the mills -- especially those who had young families to support -- found that no industrious effort, no frugality in household outlay, and no self-denial in the way of luxuries, could guarantee them against the sharp pinchings of poverty, during even a short season of sickness, unless they could devise some method of preventing the absorption of their earnings by greedy and unscrupulous traders, who, in the best of times, charged exorbitant profits on what they sold, and in the dull seasons succeeded in mortgaging every item of their customer's personal effects for two or three weeks' credit. Many of the very poorest mill-workers of Rochdale were intelligent as well as sober, and their desperate circumstances, during a long crisis in the cotton manufacture, brought them inspiration. They determined (the best of a body of operatives mainly belonging to one mill) to club together. Their joint capital made up a sum of fifteen odd pounds sterling. With this they opened a store, getting credit for the rent of the building. At the beginning there was no profit, and very little satisfaction. But the acting manager, himself a workman, was persevering; the directors, in the main, were men of firm purpose, and all of them were true to each other. Energy, steadiness of effort, courage and honest dealing ultimately gained the day. That fifteen pounds' stock of goods -- mainly groceries -- has grown steadily and surely, till to-day it approaches close to half a million sterling. It has had, as all great enterprises necessarily have, a varying fortune. But those who have stuck to it -- and they form nineteen-twentieths of the class that first instituted the business -- have improved their fortunes in a variety of ways. They bear testimony in their latest reports, that the combination to purchase articles of daily and necessary consumption -- after paying liberally for the management of their stores -- has been, on an average, a saving of fifteen per cent, in household expenditures, besides leaving considerable dividends of accumulated profits. They show what is still more important, that the Cooperative Union tends to create and to foster provident habits, and that among the workmen, who are members of the association, independence and self-reliance have fructified to an extent which it is difficult to estimate or describe.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Industrious Poor and Trading Monopolies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Industrious Poor and Trading Monopolies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/443c8f1b-6515-5f5e-bd63-16746ef1c852,772,nyt://article/443c8f1b-6515-5f5e-bd63-16746ef1c852,

The Foreign Minister, by long unquestioned usage, has been in the habit of consulting with the President of the Board of Trade when important questions of commercial interest had to be decided. But the arrangement has been altogether of a loose sort. Commercial men, having a grievance at some foreign part, have scarcely known how to apply for a remedy. At the Foreign Office there, was often no one to whom technical points of commercial law were so familiar as to enable the information to be readily given. Their, if the matter was referred to the Board of Trade, there were necessarily further vexatious delays interposed, and even the Board of Trade could not give a final decision without another consultation with the Foreign Office. One office could interpret the case, and report upon it to the satisfaction of the applicant. But the ultimate decision could only be reached through the other office.

It was felt on all hands that, however prompt and effective the joint action of the authorities of the Police and Fire Departments proved to be, when the first alarm was given, it was an act of wisdom to let it be known that the criminals would be summarily tried before a military tribunal, treated as rebel spies if found guilty, and thereupon hanged with dispatch. Equally reassuring to the public is Gen. DIX's supplementary order, requiring that persons arriving here from the insurgent States, shall promptly register their names at Gen. PECK's headquarters, in order to avoid being regarded as spies and treated accordingly. A wholesome application of military law will do an uncommon amount of good at this particular juncture.

Jersey City--Infant by Drunken Father,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/28/archives/newjersey.html,Jersey City--Infant by Drunken Father,"AN INFANT'S BRAINS KNOCKED OUT BY ITS FATHER. -- On Saturday afternoon, a man named BERNARD FITZPATRICK residing at No. 113 Morganstreet, Jersey City, in a building known as "" Marine Terrace,"" while under the influence of liquor, threw a stove lid at his wife, which struck her infant daughter, 18 months of age, in her arms, and dashed its brains out. The child died in halt an hour afterward. FITZPATRICK, upon realizing what he had done, left the house, threatening to destroy his own life, but was taken in custody shortly afterward at the corner of Provost and South Eighth streets, by Officers J. NUGENT and COTTRELL. An inquest was held by Coroner FARREL yesterday afternoon. MARGARET FITZPATRICK, wife of the prisoner, testified that her husband had been on a spree all last week, and when under the influence of liquor acted in a crazy manner and was quarrelsome; on Saturday he drank liquor, and in the afternoon slept about an hour on the floor, when he woke up and told his wife to send the boy out for more liquor; she refused, and told him that he was a drunken loafer. and then went down stairs with her infant; when nearly at the foot of the stairs, she saw the blood flowing from her child's head, and heard something drop on the floor, which she did not see, but believed it was a piece of the stove; she called for help and then returned to the room, when her husband exclaimed, ""My God, have I done that to my child?"" and then went out; the child died shortly after. Dr. WALTER J. HADDAN, who was called in, testified that when he arrived at the house the child was dying; he examined the wound and found a compound fracture of the skull, and a portion of the brains were protruding; the injury seemed to have been done by some blunt instrument; the wound was about three inches in length, and in an oblique direction, as though something had been thrown. The jury rendered a verdict that they believed that ELIZABETH FITZPATRICK came to her death by a blow from a piece of stove at the hands of her father. Upon the rendition of the verdict, Coroner FARREL committed the prisoner to the County Jail for trial.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-11-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c5205f96-a7f3-5140-923f-c873ebcccaf5,589,nyt://article/c5205f96-a7f3-5140-923f-c873ebcccaf5,

By vessels which arrived yesterday at Annapolis with twelve hundred and forty six of OUT men, comes the report that with the reception of this batch of prisoners in Savannah River on the 25th, the announcement was made by the rebel agent that the exchange had ceased. The reason assigned for this was that SHERMAN had cut off the railroads leading from Savannah, and had, as it was thought, reached the place where the remainder of OUT prisoners in the State ate confined. SHERMAN, by this report, is made to appear as having been within six hours' march of the Stockade at Millen, at the latest report on Friday last. To this is appended the conjectural statement that the rebels would make an effort to remove our prisoners to Florida before SHERMAN should reach them. Millen, where the bulk of our prisoners are kept, is directly in SHERMAN's road toward Savannah, after leaving ???lledgeville, And if he was within six hours' march of the place on Friday last, he has made, ere now, two-thirds of his journey from Atlanta to the coast, supposing Savannah to be his main objective point.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-11-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0f34246-50e4-5a40-9c08-8b70f1237b43,329,nyt://article/f0f34246-50e4-5a40-9c08-8b70f1237b43,

Slow Progress; a Slight Rebel Mistake,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/11/29/archives/a-rebel-mistake.html,Slow Progress; a Slight Rebel Mistake,"-- The Richmond papers of the 25th attempt to draw comfort from what they are pleased to term ""SHERMAN's slow progress."" They state that up to the 25th he had advanced but seventy-five miles, and had been out fifteen days. The rebels are mistaken. SHERMAN did not leave Atlanta until Nov. 14, and part of his force even not until the 15th. So that, at the outside, he had not been out more than eleven days, up to the 25th. Now, according to rebel reports, SHERMAN's forces captured Milledgeville and Gordon on the twenty-first, only seven days after he set out from Atlanta; and on the 23d our cavalry occupied Toomsboro, on the Georgia Central Railroad, fifteen miles east of Gordon. The distance from Atlanta to Savannah, via Macon, is 284 miles; the distance from Atlanta to Gordon is 124 miles, but Gen. SHERMAN shortened this distance about fifteen miles by avoiding Macon. Nevertheless, the rebels own reports prove that he had actually moved one hundred and ten miles in seven days, more than fulfilling his marching order, which was that the army should average fifteen miles per day.

STURGES, Esq., R.B. ROOSEVELT, Esq., CHARLES O'CONOR, Esq., and others. The meeting having been called to order, JONATHAN STURGES was chosen Chairman. R.B. ROOSEVELT acted as Secretary. An interesting and elaborate report was read by Mr. ROOSEVELT, which embraced the various proceedings of the association since its commencement, the establishment of a Sanitary Bureau, together with subjects for sanitary inquiry, all bearing on the health of the city. The meeting was then addressed by Dr. THOMPSON, Secretary of the Sanitary Bureau, who explained in a very lucid manner the several steps adopted in obtaining the sanitary reports of the present state of the city. In the course of his remarks, Dr. THOMPSON paid a just and well-merited compliment to the various medical gentlemen throughout the city, who had voluntarily engaged in the work of visiting the localities of the city where sickness most prevailed, and supplying the councils of the association with valuable information, particularly as to tenement houses, the number of families therein and space allotted to each, and other subjects for sanitary inquiry. In the course of his remarks, the Doctor exhibited to the meeting a carefully prepared sanitary map of the City, showing where sickness and mortality most prevailed. The Doctor concluded his interesting address amid great applause. Dr. SMITH in a few remarks pointed out to the meeting the great labors of the association, alluding to the fearful deathrate of the city, and the necessity of active measures being adopted in checking the ravages of the disease. Gen. VIELE, in a few remarks, explained what had been done in the Engineer Department of the association. After which, NATHANIEL SANDS, Esq., stated that a mass meeting of the association would be held at the Cooper Institute on Thursday evening, and called on all to support the nominations of the association.
