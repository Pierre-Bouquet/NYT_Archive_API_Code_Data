Postal Money Order System,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/02/archives/the-moneyorder-system.html,Postal Money Order System,"-- The introduction of the money-order system, which has now the sanction of law, will be found to add no ordinary amount of labor to the Post-office Department, and especially to the large branch offices throughout the country. Although the transactions will not include what is properly exchange business -- the highest permissible order being limited to $30 -- yet the security of the mode of transmission, the perfect arrangements that can be made for sending remittances along the whole vast range of territory embraced in the operations of the Post-office, the speed with which mail matter is carried from the most distant opposite points, and above all, the reasonable rate of the charges for the service rendered -- assure us of the early growth of a vast business which will tax the utmost skill, ingenuity and energy of the officers of the department to set it in proper working order, at the beginning, and maintain it permanently in the same condition. For ten cents an order, in value from one to ten dollars, may be sent from New-York to San Francisco; for fifteen cents an order of ten to twenty dollars; and an order for thirty dollars may be had for twenty cents. The economy of the arrangement alone will thus bring to the department a number of customers which to those who may not have watched the progress of the system in Great Britain would appear incredible. And, in this view, we hear with satisfaction, that the Postmaster-General has determined to take ample time for perfecting the new machinery which will be found requisite before he authorizes the issue of a single order. There is no necessity whatever to rush into the business in slap-dash fashion. It demands thought, care, business tact, and the contributed experience of those who have worked the machinery elsewhere. And these are prerequisites which include most especially the element of time.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12a728b1-bba2-5305-9229-34e3a8035196,441,nyt://article/12a728b1-bba2-5305-9229-34e3a8035196,

The committee have had under close and personal examination various fat-boiling establishments, beside a number of offal and hide-houses. They have also made something equivalent to a chemical analysis of various municipal malodors not heretofore catalogued, we believe, in the Health Department. And the investigation has brought the committe to the conclusion that the fat and offal-houses -- especially some of those on the north and west side of the City -- are noisome, offensive and intolerable to the utmost degree, generating disease in various malignant forms, rendering many dwellings in their neighborhood uninhabitable, and thus retarding the prosperity of the City, while imperilling the lives of the people. The committee have found, that there is the amplest power vested by the Legislature in the Board of Health, to effect a removal of the nuisances thus described, and they ask the Mayor to bring that body together to hear the committee's evidence, and take prompt and decisive action thereupon.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY NUISANCES THE PUBLIC HEALTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY NUISANCES THE PUBLIC HEALTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/510c3e43-c7ba-50d7-b605-77a455b9ecbf,452,nyt://article/510c3e43-c7ba-50d7-b605-77a455b9ecbf,

Tuesday being the 31st, was the last day on which these services are conducted. At St Teresa's Church, corner of Rutgers and Henry streets, the closing services were particularly interesting and impressive. This splendid church, but yet it might be said in its infancy, was thronged with a large and highly respectable congregation. Some one hundred female children, dressed entirely in white, emblematic of the purity of the Virgin Mother, walked in procession, chanting her litany and invoking her protection. One of the band, a handsome little child, offered aloud an eloquent prayer to the Mother of God, in which the congregation fervently joined. Those children then marched around the church, carrying a banner at their head, on which were inscribed the words: ""Children of Mary."" On the reverse side of this banner was a likeness of the Blessed Virgin, and underneath the words: ""Ave Maria."" Rev. Father BRIADY, assistant pastor of the church, made some eloquent and appropriate remarks upon the occasion. After solemn benediction the ceremonies closed.

The prospectus of a company for establishing floating telegraph and light-ships at such points as Cape Race, has been issued in London, with a capital of £250,000 sterling. The Prince of Walos appeared as a public speaker for the first time at the Annual Banquet of the Royal Literary Fund. He is highly complimented by all sections of the press for the grace and tact with which he discharged the duties of Chairman. The privateer Georgia has been advertised for sale, with all her equipments and stores. The House of Commons reassembled after the Whitsuntide holidays on the 19th of May, and Lord PALMERSTON again appeared in his place on the 20th. On that day he had to meet an attack on the Government policy in China, by one of his own followers -- defending the policy of intervention. Mr. LAYARD announced in the House that the Government had official intelligence of the exodus of a large body of the Circassian people from Russia, and their appeal to the British Government for protection. The prospects as to the issue of the conference become every day gloomier, and it is said the French Government regard this state of things with satisfaction. Austria and Prussia demand the complete autonomy of the Duchies, their personal union with Denmark, material guarantees, and indeed almost the programme entire of the German Diet. The Swedish Minister in London complains that his private dispatches have been tampered with in passing through Germany. The Allied invaders are openly charged with virtually violating the terms of the armistice in their warlike preparations, and the exactions which continue to be made by the Prussian authorities on the inhabitants of Jutland. Measures are in progress at Berlin for the construction of a Schleswig-Holstein canal, to connect the North Sea with the Baltic. The Opinione, of Turin, of the 16th of May, says in regard to the Pope's illness, that it has increased to so alarming an extent that a secret bull has been issued, ordering a conclave composed only of the Cardinals present in Rome for the election of a successor to PIUS IX., before his death is announced to the public.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c83d7052-cbb7-5d5a-b53a-bbd24206d63e,405,nyt://article/c83d7052-cbb7-5d5a-b53a-bbd24206d63e,

The rebel attempt on our left, it seems was completely foiled, while HANCOCK's movement on the rebel left, was successful in the extreme. During the night the rebels made an attempt to surprise HANCOCK and regain the position lost, but they were again severely repulsed with a loss of several hundred prisoners. During Tuesday morning our whole line was advanced so as to correspond with HANCOCK'S position, which occasioned considerable skirmishing, but no general engagement occurred.

Separate contracts will have to be made with the two Governments for the monthly service intended, and time will be required to negotiate the terms of the joint enterprise, so as to insure mutual benefit and mutual satisfaction in carrying it on. The Postmaster-General will have the entire charge and responsibility of framing the contract and determining the efficiency of its fulfillment. This will simplify the initiatory labor of the project, as well as give better assurance for its proper subsequent working than under the old system, which prevailed both in England and here, of dividing the labor and the responsibility between several departments -- the Treasury, the Naval Department and the Post-office, all having been allowed a voice in the arrangements.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MAIL STEAMSHIP SUBSIDIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MAIL STEAMSHIP SUBSIDIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Brazil', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fa48b9d6-8a13-5fd7-b8e5-cf13d867be95,190,nyt://article/fa48b9d6-8a13-5fd7-b8e5-cf13d867be95,

As this has already been read, at a moderate computation, by every other man woman and child in the country -- excepting, of course, the few cold-blooded individuals occasionally met with who tell you they prefer to wait till a story is ""all out"" -- it is unnecessary to discuss its merits very elaborately. The first chapter -- a scene on the River Thames, where the unhallowed trade of the characters introduced, is rather indicated than described -- is a masterpiece. Afterward there is a sad fall ""up stairs"" into fashionable society, where failure is the result of the most elaborate painstaking, and every reader will fervently hope he may hear as little as possible of ""The Veneerings."" The writer feels his ground again on the lower strata of middle class life when among the ""R. Wilfer Family,"" and the general impression left by the first installment is that many pleasant things are in store for the future, with indications of a more complicated plot than DICKENS has hitherto succeeded in successfully managing. ""Wine-Making in California"" and a ""Chapter on the Coolie Trade,"" are the illustrated articles, the former chiefly founded on Mr. HARAZTHY's book. ""Why I Wrote It,"" has an air of truth and nature about it that will engage general sympathy.

"-The seventh number of this very excellent publication surpasses all its predecessors in present interest. It contains a fac-simile of Col. DAHLGREN's instructions to the troops engaged in the recent raid upon Richmond, the capital of the Southern Confederacy. Col. DAHLGREN was the son of Admiral DAHLGREN, the well-known artillerist, and was selected to lead a bold attempt at a surprise of Richmond by Federal cavalry. The attempt failed; the greater part of the Federal force was killed or destroyed. DAHLGREN himself was shot in an encounter with some of the Richmond Home Guards. On his person was found a copy of his instructions to his men, and of an address, issued at the moment of starling, in his own handwriting. These instructions betray a deliberate intention to burn and sack Richmond, and to kill President DAVIS and his Cabinet. They were immediately published by the Confederate Government in order to show the true spirit in which the Federals are carrying on the war. But the Northern press, while admitting the instructions to be generally correct, asserted that the special directions as to the murder of JEFF. DAVIS and his Cabinet were interpolations and forgeries of the Confederates. To meet this charge the authorities at Richmond had an exact fac-simile taken of the original instructions. This fac-simile has been carefully lithographed for the Autographic Mirror; and it needs no expert to determine at a glance that every line and letter is in Col. DAHLGREN's own handwriting. This document alone gives a great historical interest to the present number. -- London Herald, May 20.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/03/archives/col-dahlgrens-orders.html,,"-The seventh number of this very excellent publication surpasses all its predecessors in present interest.

WRIGHT's corps succeeded in taking the enemy's works, and holding them in spite of all the enemy could do to drive our men out. Gen. SMITH also took a line in his front, but as they were commanded from the rear, they were not tenable. During the night several assaults, on our line were made by the rebels, but each time they were repulsed with loss. During the day previous, (Tuesday,) SHERIDAN's cavalry had a severe fight with the rebel cavalry and CLINGMAN's brigade of infantry, in which the latter were driven back with severe punishment.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ae55b13-d558-51e3-9418-d0f13126061e,402,nyt://article/7ae55b13-d558-51e3-9418-d0f13126061e,

The rebel writer gives a highly colored account of a fight in which the ""Minie balls of the Yankees poured over the rebel line in an unceasing stream,"" and adds: ""But one thing saved us from a fearful loss of life, and it was that the Yankees fired entirely too high."" The Union writer, after giving an account of the very desperate fight at Rome Cross-roads, says: ""It was a matter of wonder, after the engagement, to ascertain that the loss in action did not exceed seventy-five. It could only be accounted for by the fact that the rebels fired too high, their balls striking always above our heads.""

There is reason in this view of the case. No one grudges the weather-beaten apple-woman her stall on the street; but it is generally supposed that traders of the presumed standing of Mr. BERNARD KINNEY might be accommodated in-doors, unless, indeed, there are special reasons for inviting them into the street. We believe it is a generally understood thing that Vesey-street is part of the public common, and that any one may pitch a tent there for general mercantile purposes without the permission either of the Common Council or his Worship the Mayor. But Wall-street is supposed to be reserved for street operations of a special kind, and on this ground -- if on no other -- the Mayor's treatment of Mr. KINNEY will probably be justified, although, as we are getting accustomed to every variety of nuisance, we do not know that so much need be said of this Wall-street favorite of the Common Council.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STORES ON THE SIDEWALK', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STORES ON THE SIDEWALK', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b28f4736-9b8d-572e-acf0-39becdba78d9,230,nyt://article/b28f4736-9b8d-572e-acf0-39becdba78d9,

"The indecorous haste and carelessness usually observable in England on the disposal of the effects of celebrated, and particularly of literary men, immediately after their decease, was never more strongly exemplified than in the recent sale of THACKERAY'S library and papers.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/04/archives/literary-gossip.html,,"-- The indecorous haste and carelessness usually observable in England on the disposal of the effects of celebrated, and particularly of literary men, immediately after their decease, was never more strongly exemplified than in the recent sale of THACKERAY'S library and papers. From the accounts of the auction it is evident that the most valuable materials for his biography were sacrificed and dispersed without a thought of their intrinsic value, or the purpose to which they might be properly applied. As a sample, among the lots were ""four large drawers, like those of a kitchen dresser,"" full of books, not very inviting in outward aspect, but the more valuable because they had been actually ""used up"" by the late owner, and were crowded with his memoranda, sketches, notes, &c. These are all now being catalogued and invitingly set forth to the public, at high prices by the booksellers, who made a fortunate speculative purchase of these and other similar lots. Among them we notice one article worth mentioning -- ""Sketch Book of Mr. THACKERAY during a tour in France in 1842 and 1843 with upward of forty colored pen-and-ink and pencil drawings of shipping, old buildings, churches, characteristic figures, landscape groups, &c., including 'Rouen,' 'Honfleur,' 'The Banks of the Seine,' &c., very spirited, full of character, and ready for publication."" This valuable relic is priced, not immoderately, at six guineas. In one of his ""Roundabout Papers,"" THACKERAY mentions that the two favorite books he was accustomed to take to bed with him was Montaigne's Essays and Howell's Letters. The relic-hunter may secure, no doubt, the identical copy of old Howell for the small sum of five shillings sterling. An American book -- MILLMAN's Rifle, Axe and Saddlebags, ""with the autograph THACKERAY in fancy letters,"" is now highly priced at one pound. The catalogue before us contains one hundred and twenty-six lots of a similar character, including presentation copies from authors to THACKERAY, books belonging to his father, others given to his daughters, &c., the sale of which seems to show a sad want of feeling, when there could be no pecuniary necessity to excuse it, as the property left by the novelist was estimated for the legacy duties at twenty thousand pounds.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7353f627-5a07-5578-9f94-65b32b4d8e8e,1539,nyt://article/7353f627-5a07-5578-9f94-65b32b4d8e8e,

"Tuckerman, H. T. America and Her Commentators",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/04/archives/new-books-america-and-her-commentators-with-a-critical-sketch-of.html,"Tuckerman, H. T. America and Her Commentators","In the existing plethora of literacy matter, when it is almost impossible to keep up with the current of publication on any given subject in America, England, France and Germany -- much less to carry investigations backward into times past -- any book about books that furnishes the student with the results of reading and inquiry on a special branch of research is sure of a favorable reception. In this view Mr. TUCKERMAN's work will be extremely acceptable to many -- containing, as it does, an elegant and spirited survey of a class of books that some representation of is felt to be indispensable in every American library, while none but a large public collection would like to be burdened by the whole number, supposing such a thing to be obtainable. The value of a critical guide like that before us is at once obvious as affording the basis for a judicious selection, independently of its intrinsic interest as a curious chapter in literary history. Wonderful, indeed, is the consecrating and ennobling power of Time -- the trashiest libel -- the feeblest or most ferocious utterance hiding itself in neglected print -- of to-day -- when once a portion of the pitiless and inexorable past becomes a thing for historians to study, for philosophers to discuss. The colossus of history is a composite structure, built up principally by the aggregation of materials from which nothing is rejected as too small or trifling in the eye of the master-workman, like MACAULAY, who is able to penetrate to and lay bare the springs of human action, from the slight indications afforded by the outward form and pressure of things apparently the most trivial, but pregnant with suggestion when rightly considered. Of this class was originally a large portion of the materials on which the early history of the United States of America must rest. State papers and documents may supply the bony skeleton, the framework of the narrative, but the mind desiderates something more succulent. In the country itself the struggle for life was too engrossing to allow much time for the jotting down of facts that might illustrate its social progress. The great present was too earnestly felt, was too exacting in its claims on all to be written about in the dilettanti spirit that only comes with ease and reflection; consequently, we are dependent on the reports of those whom chance brought to our shores for the lights and shadows that give animation and expression to the story of the past. Thus the most curious account of Boston and its inhabitants in the early part of the last century that remains to us, is given by a bookseller, the famous JOHN DUNTON, who brought over a cargo of literary ware as a speculation, and opened a store in Boston to dispose of it. His ""Life and Errors"" narrates his experience in New-England, but has not apparently fallen in Mr. TUCKERMAN's way. We may say indeed, once for all, that a work of this kind being founded on bibliography, a more exact acquaintance with that study would have cleared it of many errors of names and dates, corrected numberless misprints which are now very offensive to the eyes of those who discern them, and have supplied many omissions that would have added to the interest and completeness of the undertaking. One obvious defect, only, will we mention, that is, the want of a methodical or chronological catalogue raisonne of the authors, analyzed or referred to in the text; others it might seem invidious to dwell upon, as they do not largely detract from the value of the book for general readers. Mr. TUCKERMAN's object is (as he himself declares) ""two-fold -- to present a general view of the traits and transitions of our country, as recorded at different periods, and by writers of various nationalities; and to afford those desirous of authentic information in regard to the United States, a guide to the sources thereof"" -- the latter incidentally involving the discussion of the comparative value and interest of the principal critics of our civilization. Starting with the discovery of the continent, a rapid introductory view is taken of the early voyagers and explorers who have left memorials of their expeditions, often the records of enterprise and endurance worthy of the most heroic ages of the world, that most always remain precious in the estimation of those to whose ancestors the goodly land they possess was by them laid open and made accessible. They fall into two great divisions as far as the present United States are concerned. The founders of Virginia and of New-England, of whom Capt. JOHN SMITH and Gov. WINTHROP may be taken as the respective types. Brief notice is made of the Northern navigators and their half-mythical Vinland, but the work only fairly commences with the next chapter, dedicated to the French missionary explorers of New-York, Canada and the Great West, HENNEPIN, MENARD, ALLOUEZ, MARQUETTE, CHARLEVOIX, &c. The memory of these enlightened men, devoted to their self-imposed task -- not to be swerved from it by any considerations of personal safety, but often sacrificing their lives to the maintenance of the principles that inspired them -- still lingers fragantly over many a sunny cove and inlet in the great lakes -- many a haunted isle in the blue waters of the St. Lawrence. There is no purer page in history than that devoted to the unadorned recital of their labors. As related by themselves, the simplicity of the tone adopted shows that they were following in the straight-forward path of duty, unconscious that future generations would look up to them admiringly as the true pioneers of civilization, in regions more weird and remote from the ordinary associations, than we can now well realized. Continuing the treatment of his subject by nationalities, Mr. TUCKERMAN next proceeds to the later group of French travelers and writers whose connection with the War of the Revolution caused their testimony to be eagerly sought for in Europe, and still furnishes us with many of the most interesting details that we possess relative to that event. Prominent among them is the lively and satirical Marquis DE CHASTELLUX, whose travels are well analyzed; the Abbe ROBIN, Chaplain to Gen. ROCHAMBEAU, and the unfortunate BRISSOT DE WARVILLE, who visited America fatally to his future lot in his native country, where he died a victim to the vain attempt of naturalizing in an uncongenial soil the ideas he had imbibed abroad. Great names of statesmen thrown on these shores by the storms of the French Revolution follow quickly. CHATEAUBRIAND, TALLEYRAND, SEGUR, LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, VOLNEY and others, have all left memorials of their impressions more or less satisfactory, and at the present day French travel culminates in the height of mental culture, that yields the clear philosophic vision and the power of generalization from scattered and imperfect data characterizing the works of DE TOCQUEVILLE, CHEVALIER, DE BEAUMONT, POUSSIN, AMPERE, DE GASPARIN, &c. The English travelers come next in order. Foremost among them stands the apostolical figure of BERKELEY. The personal history of this self-denying prolate has been a favorite study of Mr. TUCKERMAN's, and it is accordingly treated con amore in this chapter. The names that follow are of a very miscellaneous character, and there are none to equal in attraction those that the record of French travel has to show. Even the Revolution itself was little productive of book making in England, compared with what now follows any striking event; probably the unfortunate issue of the conflict may have rendered it a subject that afforded little gratification to the Georgian era of readers. The idyllic pictures of rural life in New-York, by Mrs. GRANT, of Laggan, are the chief domestic English memorials of the ante-revolutionary period in our Northern States. A few participants in the war and its results have left personal narrations, as CAPT. ANBUREY, a captive with BURGOYNE's army, and WILLIAM EDDIS, the royalist collector of the customs at Baltimore, and others; but the total amount of information so preserved is not important. It was in the next generation -- when the economic advantages of America as a home and refuge for the multitudes struggling for mere existence in Europe first attracted attention -- that the shoal of English travelers properly begins, and continues to the present day in scarcely abated numbers. Too numerous to be all characterized, Mr. TUCKERMAN gives a fair account of the more prominent among them, doing justice to the descriptive powers and vivacity of Mrs. TROLLOPE, the conscientious dullness of Capt. BASIL HALL, the glowing admiration for nature of FANNY KEMBLE, the scientific accuracy of Sir CHARLES LYELL, while he justly animadverts on the unfairness that generally marks their strictures on the social condition and aspects of life in the country they describe. The name of this class is legion, but nearly all of any pretension will be found alluded to in Mr. TUCKERMAN's book. The northern European writers, mostly from Germany, afford materials for the next chapter, and the following one completes the European travelers and commentators by an enumeration of those of Italy, several of whom are curious, and little known. In conclusion some space is allotted to the home travelers who have extended the knowledge of the continent of their birth or adoption, in the interests of science and commerce, and to the general works descriptive of the United States, as an aggregate, destined for the information of foreigners or our own countrymen. The work cannot fail to be generally useful, and fills a place in our libraries as yet unoccupied.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; AMERICA AND HER COMMENTATORS, with a Critical Sketch of Travel in the United States.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/04/archives/naval-movements-partial-completion-of-lightdraft-ironclads-the.html,,"A visit to the iron-clad shipyards in the neighborhood of New-York, in which the last batch of light-dratt vessels are building, shows that the Naubuc, Modoc and Cohoes would be ready for launching within five or six weeks. These vessels, although having an immense armor, will draw only six feet of water. They were contracted for at the rate of $365,000 each if built in six months, and $395,000 if built in nine months. They had hardly been commenced, however, when new and valuable improvements, suggested by the experience of our other vessels at Charleston, were introduced; and these necessarily threw the work backward a great deal, so that some ten or twelve of the ships, which would now have been afloat and preparing rapidly for active service, are only on the verge of completion. Fourteen are all planked, so that if their services were immediately required, night and day work could finish them in exceedingly short space of time. There is hardly a river or a lagoon of the South in which these vessels cannot move with ease and safety, while they can take these guns of a heavier calibre than were ever seen on rivers before. Their motive power is screw of sufficient magnitude to propel them at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour. Not being intended for ocean service their motions on the coast will necessarily have to be well considered and few. They are essentially harbor batteries. If the nineteen vessels of this class, which are now building, could at this time be transported to the Mississippi there would be an end of the rebel gunboats. They possess nearly all the defensive power of the original monitor, and as much offensive power, their only weak point being below water-mark, and the rebels have proved recently that they can reach our ships in that region very effectively.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naval Movements.; PARTIAL COMPLETION OF LIGHT-DRAFT IRON-CLADS.

Entering the army as a private at the outbreak of the war, Col. GREEN was promoted for the brave conduct at the battle of Roanoke Island. He passed through various battles and skirmishes -- among others that of Cedar Mountain, at which he was captured, and taken to the Libby Prison at Richmond. After his exchange he continued in the service, and received especial mention for his courageous conduct in capturing, with his own hand, the sword of a Georgia Captain and the battle-flag of the regiment. The sword was presented to Col. GREEN, by the Commanding General, and he was promoted to a Lieutenant-Colency. About a year since he left for the Department of the Gulf, passed with his regiment through the whole Louisiana campaign and that of the Red River, up to the time of the battle in which he received his death-wound. He was unusually well read in military law, and had been intrusted with the presidency of courts-martial for the trial of offences punishable with death. He was brave, manly and honorable, and his assiduous attention to the comfort of the men under his command gave him a high place in their affections, and insured a cheerful alacrity in obedience.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEATH OF LIEUT.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/04/archives/singular-charge-of-adultery.html,,"In 1851, in Zanesville, O., one JOHN W. SOALES, butcher, was arrested and lodged in jail on a charge of larceny, the larceny alleged consisting in an unlawful appropriation of certain pigs. Shortly after his release from jail on this charge, fearing another arrest for some offence not known, SCALES left Zanesville early one morning and made his way to Cincinnati. He left in Zanesville his wife, CATHERINE, and children, without provision for their support. The wife heard from him, by letter, once after he left her, and that about a month after he had run away. Some two years or more after, having had an offer of marriage again, she sought a divorce on the ground of desertion, but suspended proceedings, by advice of her lawyer, on learning that SCALES was dead, and so informed her intended new husband. A short time after, in the Spring of 1855, she was married to her present husband, Mr. WM.S. JONES, with whom she has lived since that time -- the last three or four years in St. Paul. Her husband has held a respectable position in society, and her deportment has been such as to commend her to those with whom she became acquainted. Recently, her former husband, SCALES, made his appearance in this city, had interviews with Mr. JONES and with Mrs. JONES, and finally made complaint of adultery against JONES, before Justice MCELRATH of the Police Court. An examination was had on the complaint, yesterday, before Justice MCELRATH, and the complaint was dismissed and JONES discharged from arrest. On announcement of the decision, there was a word or two of emphatic approval from one or two of the persons present who had listened to the evidence in the case, while the looks of all showed their sympathy with the defendant. Mrs. JONES was present during the examination, sitting by the side of Mr. JONES, and at its close walked away with him. Mr. SCALES, the complaining witness, fell asleep during the argument of the lawyers, and so remained at the close of the Justice's decision. His appearance would be apt to make an impression against him with a jury. -- St. Paul Press, May 26.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SINGULAR CHARGE OF ADULTERY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SINGULAR CHARGE OF ADULTERY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4ecfeaf-3e34-5de7-bdb4-447b286f2ca0,366,nyt://article/d4ecfeaf-3e34-5de7-bdb4-447b286f2ca0,

"-- We talked yesterday with CHARLES DYER, a private in Company E, One Hundred and Fifteenth New-York Volunteers, who was captured by the rebels at the battle of Olustee, Florida, on the 20th of February. He was carried by his captors to the arsenal in the town of Chattahooche, from which he made his escape, and arrived within the Union lines at Larkinvile, on the Tennessee and Alabama Railroad, after a painful and hazardous journey through the woods for more than 250 miles. He was chased once, and overtaken by a squad of rebel cavalry, accompanied by a pack of seven bloodhounds, who would have torn him to pieces but for the admonition of the Captain, who shouted to him to climb a tree. He did climb in a hurry, and just as he was mounting with accelerated velocity, one of the hounds snapped at him and left the print of his teeth quite visible on Mr. DYER's heel. The country through which Mr. DYER passed was almost uninhabited. Scarcely an able-bodied man was visible; a few aged or decrepit men, and the white women and little children who were working in the fields, were the only persons visible.

""The divergence of opinion,"" says the London News, ""not only between the belligerents, but between Austria, Prussia and the neutral Powers, is so wide that they have not been able even to agree on any common basis of discussion."" The Danish plenipotentiaries have taken their stand on the Treaty of London, and insist that the provisions of that instrument are binding on all the parties who assented to it. The German diplomats, on the contrary, abjure that treaty altogether, and maintain that the war has freed them from its trammels; while the representatives of the neutral States, though inclining to the Danish view of the question, feel themselves paralyzed from inability to reconcile the jarring pretensions of the litigants. The pacificators are in fact in a dead lock, and cannot advance a single step as long as this London Treaty is suffered to remain as a stumbling block in their way. Whatever might be its obligations under other circumstances, it is now impracticable. The solution of the problem touching the future relations of the Duchies to Denmark, will prove amply sufficient to test the tact of the opposing plenipos, without superadding the unprofitable task of attempting to attain unanimity as to the meaning of this instrument, to which Europe owes both the war and the Conference.

With its opening days, our two great armies in Virginia and in Georgia simultaneously advanced -- the advance quickly followed, in the one field, with the deliverance of battle by LEE, his repulse and retreat; and in the other field, the advance speedily progressing, with the driving of JOHNSTON from one and another, and still others, of the heights and ridges of the mountains of upper Georgia. As the days wore on, the battle of the Wilderness was succeeded by the battles at Spottsylvania; the flanking movement on the lines of Mine Run was followed by the flanking movement on the line of the Po; this again followed by forcing the passage of the North Anna, the recrossing of that stream and the flanking of LEE's lines on the South Anna; this followed, by the passage of the Pamunky, the march direct toward the objective of Richmond, and the contest at the Chickahominy. In all of which movements Lieut.-Gen. GRANT took the initiative, while LEE was compelled, in each successive instance, to wait upon the will, and adapt himself as best he might, to the movements of his adversary. When the month opened our army was something less than a hundred miles from Richmond; at its close we were within ten miles of it; and although, in some circumstances, this might form no criterion whatever by which to judge of our gains, we think that viewing the incidents and reviewing the history of the advance, we can be guided by it somewhat in measuring how we stand as compared with how we stood.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The May Campaigns.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The May Campaigns.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17338f2f-a3e7-5067-ba7e-ecb1a47335f4,566,nyt://article/17338f2f-a3e7-5067-ba7e-ecb1a47335f4,

During the night the watcher was seized with an attack of delirium tremens, and in his frenzy assaulted the helpless invalid and beat him to death! When the sick chamber was entered at an early hour in the morning, the madman was found dragging the corpse of his victim about the floor, kicking and stamping upon it. The head of the dead man was shockingly cut and mangled. The maniac murderer was with difficulty secured, manifesting a savage determination to continue his work of violence, and shouting frantically his intention to ""get the devil out of him."" -- New Haven Palladium, June 1.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/05/archives/horrible-occurrence-at-litchfield-ct.html,,"A story is current of a shocking occurrence at Litchfield.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/05/archives/the-anglomaorian-war.html,,"Our latest intelligence from New-Zealand is of considerable importance. The capture, by Gen. CAMERON, of the native strongholds on the Waipa has broken the backbone of Maorian power, if it has not quite crushed the revolt. These strongholds were of the most elaborate construction, and so formidable that they could not have been carried by assault without great sacrifice of life. Instead of attempting to storm them, therefore, the British commander determined to turn them, and on the evening of the 20th of February he set forth, at the head of about a thousand troops, to gain the rear of the Maori position. Unperceived and unopposed the detachment passed round the intrenchments, and when the natives saw the enemy in their rear they were filled with consternation, and decided to evacuate their strongholds, while evacuation was possible. This resolve was promptly executed, and on the following morning not a single human being was found in either. The Maories retired to a point only a few miles distant, where they defended themselves obstinately for a brief space, but ultimately abandoned that position also, and sought refuge in the hill country. Since then 150 of them, regarding their cause as hopeless, have laid down their arms, and returned to their allegiance. It is despair in fact, not any anticipation of triumph, that urges the Maories to prolong the conflict. Vanquished though they have been, and expect to be, they nevertheless prefer death on the battle-field to that unconditional submission, without which they cannot obtain peace. They have heard the cry of the colonists for confiscation, they have heard that 20,000 adventurers are to be settled on the lands of which they are to be stripped, and they dread to place themselves in the power of a merciless and unscrupulous enemy, lest their only source of subsistence should be wrung from them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anglo-Maorian War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anglo-Maorian War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b5d87baf-9629-5018-b6dc-a00a73089cb8,492,nyt://article/b5d87baf-9629-5018-b6dc-a00a73089cb8,

On the 25th of May the committee fulfilled its duty by presenting Mr. SLOAN the service of plate, accompanied by a letter expressing the high appreciation in which his valuable and important services to the road are held by the board, and adding that in their unanimous judgment it was mainly to his energy and fidelity and his judgment and ability that the improved condition and flattering prospects of the road are mainly due. In acknowledgment of this very handsome testimonial, Mr. SLOAN, a few evenings since, entertained the gentlemen of the board at a private dinner, at which the silver plate for the first time performed its appropriate part. It is very massive and very elegant, having been prepared by Messrs. TIFFANY & Co. expressly for the purpose. This compliment is eminently just and deserved. Mr. SLOAN has been indefatigable in his efforts to advance the interests and promote the prosperity of the Hudson River Road, and his endeavors have been crowned with conspicuous and remarkable success. He has decided practical ability, great tenacity of purpose, and complete devotion to whatever business he has on hand.

About dusk on the same day, the enemy returned the blow of the morning, by suddenly assaulting one of our brigades, which brought on a fight that lasted with great fury for half an hour, but the attack was unwaveringly repulsed. On the same evening our cavalry thwarted a scheme of the enemy, by driving a brigade of them from their rifle-pits in confusion, after a short but sharp conflict. During the night after these operations, the enemy drew in his left wing.

Capt. ZENO C. BAKER and a deck hand, named JOHN DUNN, were crushed beneath the smokestack and instantly killed. Some other parties were more or less injured. An inquest was held on the bodies of deceased yesterday by Coroner RANNEY, from which it appears that while the smokestack was being put in place, the steamer Mary Powell passed, the waves from her making such a commotion as to cause the supports to give way. The evidence of two witnesses only were taken. These were Mr. JOHN GREY, the contractor for furnishing the machinery to the Kankakee, and Mr. LUTHER C. BAKER, brother to one of the deceased. Their evidence showed the occurrence to be accidental, and the jury rendered a verdict ""that deceased came to his death from injuries received from the accidental falling of a smokestack on board the revenue cutter Kankakee, June 1, 1864, at the foot of Horatio-street, North River; further, we recommend that six guys be used in all cases of this kind, in lieu of four, as has been common heretofore.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; TWO MEN INSTANTLY KILLED ON A SCHOONER', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; TWO MEN INSTANTLY KILLED ON A SCHOONER', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b1d5d6e-7223-571c-bfc8-0ba242952e34,585,nyt://article/4b1d5d6e-7223-571c-bfc8-0ba242952e34,

A force of our cavalry, under WILSON, the same evening, (Friday,) fell upon a rebel brigade, which LEE had thrown round to his left, for the evident purpose of enveloping BURNSIDE. WILSON drove them from their rifle-pits, but at some considerable sacrifice, Col. PRESTON, of the First Vermont Cavalry, being killed, and Col. BENJAMIN, of the Eighth New-York Cavalry, having been wounded. The dispatch also mentions the wounding of Gen. STANNARD, of the Eighteenth Corps. Gen.

"Malakoff, The Duke of",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/07/archives/obituary-the-duke-of-malakoff.html,"Malakoff, The Duke of","By the European arrivals yesterday, we have intelligence of the death of the Duke of Malakoff, more widely known as General and Marshai PELLISSIER, the Commander-in-Chief of the French army in the siege of Sebastopol. Marshal PELISSIER was in his 70th year at the time of his death, having been born near Rouen, in 1794. After completing his military studies at St. Cyr, he was gazetted a Sal-Lieutenant in 1815. Subsequently he saw service in Spain in 1823, achieved the rank of Captain in 1828, served in Greece and afterward in Algeria up to 1832, when he returned to France for the recruitment of his health. In 1839 he returned to Algeria, where he remained in active service for a period of 16 years, and it was during this period of his career that his name was first given to the world, and in a character which was long regarded as infamous. A viciously hostile tribe of Arabs made themselves conspicuous in their resistance to French authority during the insurrection of 1845. Occupying mountain fastnesses almost impenetrable to the foreign soldier, these tribes were enabled for a long time to harrass the French troops, and to openly defy effective chastisement in return. An expedient -- of which it is not known whether PILLISSIER was the actual author -- was devised to smoke the Arabs out of their caves, or burn them alive in their retreats if they refused to surrender. Defiance was the only answer of the mountain chiefs to the threat of the French commanding officer, although it is said a large portion of the mountain warriors were willing to surrender. Be this as it may, their delay in listening to the summons determined their fate. PELLESSIER ordered the faggots to be applied to the mouths of the Cauerus, and 600 of the wretched Arabs were thus consigned to a horrible and barbarous death. Various have been the palliations offered for the act, and it may be hoped there were reasons for it sufficient to relieve the perpetrators, at least, of the charge of wanton murder. The act was condemned by the French Minister of War. PELISSIER, however, was not removed from his post in Algeria, but remained there till after the outbreak of the Crimean war, when he was appointed second in command to Gen. CANROBERT. On the 19th of May, 1855, he became Commander-in-Chief of the French force in the Crimea, and his successful storming of the Malakoff, led to the evacuation of the main Sebastopol forts be the Russians, and ultimately to negotiations which ended in peace. Gen. PELESSIER became a Marshal of France and Duke of Malakoff, with a high pension, as the reward of his services, by his own government. At the hands of her Britanic Majesty he received the decoration of a Knight's Grand Cross; and was subsequently for a short time Minister to England in 1858.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.; The Duke of Malakoff.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.; The Duke of Malakoff.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/33361533-92e6-504d-90a7-0c83b27616c4,484,nyt://article/33361533-92e6-504d-90a7-0c83b27616c4,

It is truly surprising that of a disease so prevalent, and exercising such perbicious effects on the system, so little should be known by both professional and d non-professional. It is much to be regretted that the Medical Faculty should have paid so little attention to it, or otherwise much suffering, and undoubtedly many might have been saved from a premature grave. But, nevertheless, it is a fact that cannot be denied, hundreds, yes, thousand being living witnesses to this fact, and how many that are [???]e none can tell. In consequence of their total ignorance of it, and exerting themselves, in no way to gain more information on the subject, hundreds of n[???]s[???]rums, in the shape of s[???]uffs, have sprung up like mushrooms, as the [???]anaced for the disease in all its stages; and worse than this these every snuffs have been recommended by physicians. Not willing to admit their ignorance of the disease the patient is dismissed when applying for aid with the answer that ""Catarrh can never be cured."" Try a little snuff, says one: a little tine salt and sugar, says another; snuff up a little cold water, says a third. If these remedies are not prescribed, it is either neuralgia or the effects of a cold, which will soon wear away. Ala[???] how many there are that wear away before the cold do[???]. Being a regular Physician myself, and at one time a general practitioner, nothing disrespectful is intended to the general practitioner, as feeling that their services are but too little appreciated, it would be foreign to my object to wish to make the slightest imputation; but in a work like this, where the health, comfort and even lives of thousands are at stake, it is not only impossible to avoid, but absolutely necessary to criticise, even though it be harshly. It will be seen from this that really nothing that could be beneficial has been done. Consequently there are many that believe that the disease can never be cured; added to which, their having been told by those in whom they naturally placed confidence, that ""Catarrh can never be cured,"" has tended to make them more positive in their opinions. It must be remembered by such that this is a progressive age. Science has made, and is making, gigantic strides. Many things that could not be done when they were boys, and which, had one hinted of being ultimately done, would have brought down the ridicule of these before whom he should have been so foolhardy as to venture the assertion, have been accomplished. The sciences of both medicine and surgery have not been behind hand, but have kept pace with the other branches of science. How many operations in by-gone times, now performed with facility and success, were then looked on as not only impracticable, but absolutely impossible.

The China, (of the Cunard line,) which appears to have taken the place of the Europa, reached Halifax late on Sunday night, one week out from Queenstown, thus bringing the news down to the 29th of May. The news of the great battles of the Wilderness and Spottsylvania had created a most profound sensation, especially in England, as will be seen from the comments of the London Times, which we publish elsewhere. The qualities of Gen. GRANT as a commander are the subject of high eulogium even in the Anglo-rebel papers. The privateer Georgia is announced for sale at Liverpool by private treaty. The pirates of the J.G. Gerity were before the Court of Queen's Bench on a writ of habeas corpus, and were discharged -- the Chief Justice, however, dissenting from the majority of the Court. The news which was carried to Europe by the City of Washington respecting the progress of the campaign, was generally regarded as exceedingly disastrous to the rebel cause, and the rebel cotton loan had declined, thereupon, from 5 to 6 cent. The British ministry have taken a practical way of getting at the bottom of the difficulty respecting LAIRD's rebel rams: they have been purchased on Government account. It is not stated whether the executors of the late Pasha of Egypt or LAIRD himself gets the purchase money. The Derby was won by Blair Athole, Gen. Peel, second, and Scottish Chief, third. The Dano-German Conference had been holding intermittent sessions, but had come to no definite decision on the question. Various unofficial reports are given. Among others, that the British Government had agreed to a plebiscite in Schleswig. This is improbable. Lord RUSSELL had made the important announcement in the House of Lords that the Queen was no wise an obstacle in the way of giving effect to the Government policy, but cheerfully followed the advice of her responsible ministers. The Emperor and Empress of the French were about to pay a visit to the King of Prussia. The Pope continues seriously ill. The death of the Duke of Malakoff is announced.

Grant's Campaign. Battle of the Chickahominy,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/07/archives/fridays-battle.html,Grant's Campaign. Battle of the Chickahominy,"The battle of Friday last was a much more serious affair, both in its original conception, its actual character, and its final consequences, than we had been led to believe from the brief dispatches heretofore given to the public. The intention really was that it should be the decisive battle of the campaign. The movements of the preceding days, culminating in the possession of Cold Harbor -- an important strategic point -- had drawn our lines close in front of the Chickahominy, and reduced the military problem to the forcing of the passage of that river -- a problem which, if solved in our favor, would decide whether Richmond could be carried by a coup de main, if a decisive victory should attend our arms, or, whether operations would settle down to a siege in form. The great struggle did not result in a success; and though the enemy's lines were carried and temporarily held at two important points, our assaulting columns were finally compelled to abandon them. Probably no action so important in its character was ever crowded into so brief a space of time -- ten terrible minutes in the early dawn developed on the part of the enemy such strength both of position and force as to carry conviction that any victory that could here be achieved would be purchased at too great a cost.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Friday's Battle."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Friday's Battle."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80536c46-245a-5263-b008-e893fa0866ee,394,nyt://article/80536c46-245a-5263-b008-e893fa0866ee,

The estimates are various as to the numbers of the Danish force, including the volunteers that have taken up arms in defence of the independence of the country. But the regularly disciplined force of the Kingdom -- the army proper -- does not appear to have exceeded 35,000 at the commencement of hostilities. The official reports, then, show that half this force has disappeared in the bloody conflicts, from Flensburg to Duppel and Viele. In short, the Danes have lost 16,473 men, including 300 officers, besides 467 guns.

on Reconstruction and the Negro,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/08/archives/the-radicals-and-the-negroes-wendell-phillips-plan.html,on Reconstruction and the Negro,"One of the strongest arguments against Slavery, and that of which the Anti-Slavery party in this country made most use, was the degradation into which it plunged the colored race at the South. Under it the negro was as like a beast of the field as it was in the power of law and usage to make him. There was in every Southern State a code of regulations ingeniously framed for the express and avowed purpose of extinguishing in him, as far as possible, all the hopes, wants, aspirations and anxieties of a human being. Education of every kind was carefully withheld from him; all sense of self-respect was beaten out of him by the cowhide, and in order to remove all trace of connection between the slave and the rest of the human family, he was not allowed to contract a binding marriage. Of the efficiency of these measures we are unhappily not permitted to doubt. It is proved by the testimony of everybody who has examined the condition of the Southern slaves, and this testimony derives the strongest kind of corroboration from the attributes of the negroes themselves. Their marvellous quiescence for so many generations under the most horrible wrongs that man could inflict on his fellow, is, in itself, proof enough that Slavery had corrupted the soul as well as degraded the body. And even if we had been disposed to overlook these facts, the Abolitionists took good care not to let us. They kept them before us.

"The, its Deeds and Honors",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/09/archives/the-army-of-the-potomac.html,"The, its Deeds and Honors","No words can fully express the gratitude which the people owe to the Army of the Potomac. For nearly forty days and nights, now, it has either been fighting every day or performing difficult and hurried marches, or countermarching to execute some required manoeuvre. Its nights have often been spent in battle, or in making some sudden movement to circumvent the enemy. It has borne heat, and dust, and wet, sleeping on the ground and without change of garments, enduring the most incessant fatigues ever borne by any army. The armies of other nations, as the London Times well remarks, become exhausted after one or two days' battle, but this army has fought and marched for over a month without overpowering weariness, or despondency, or exhaustion. No murmur or complaint has arisen from them; on the contrary, a trustworthy correspondent describes them as more cheerful and more determined now than at the outset. During this fearful month they have sent home thirty thousand of their number with honorable wounds -- five thousand have been buried in the soil over which they have marched. Their most favorite corps commander, the experienced SEDGWICK, has been killed, with the heroic WADSWORTH and RICE, and hundreds of other brave officers, well known and long tried in the history of this army. Such fighting as they have done, as the English journals confess, has not been seen in the history of the world. Their courage, their endurance and their fortitude have shed a new lustre on the American name. For, as the rebel journals have rightly divined, the Army of the Potomac is made up to a large degree of native Americans. The very best young men of the community, representing all possible grades and ranks and professions of society, some the heirs of old families, some scholars and graduates of the professions, others mechanics and laborers and artisans; still others, the larger number in the army, coming from the most vigorous class of the whole country, the intelligent farming population. They are men who do not fight for the mere love of fighting, who have not joined the army for the paltry wages they could earn, but they are those who understand the tremendous issues at stake. They know that this is a life and death struggle for a contitinent between Freedom and Slavery.

Competitive Examinations,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/09/archives/west-point-academy.html,Competitive Examinations,"The importance of admitting cadets to the Military Academy only by open competitive examinations, is clearly proved by the history of the present graduating class. It entered with ninety-six members, and now numbers only twenty-seven. It is not usual for more than fifty per cent. to graduate. Favoritism and patronage have crowded many into the Academy who were utterly wanting in all aptitude for military studies or duties. With proper care in the selection of candidates, the per centage of graduates would be ninety. Competitive examination has long been the mode of admission in all the great military schools of Europe. ""Reward and encourage merit,"" was a favorite maxim of NAPOLEON. This year an unusual number of members of Congress have adopted this plan, and invited all candidates from their several districts to appear before a competent and impartial committee, and the result is the selection of young men of a higher order of talent and culture. Cadet LYDECKER, who is at the head of the graduating class, was appointed in this way by Gen. SICKLES. The examination of this class closed on Monday last. The class oration was given by B.G. NORTHRUP, Esq., agent of the Massachusetts Board of Education. The examination of the other classes continues through this week, with very attractive military drills every afternoon, consisting of squadron and troopers' drills, target practice with light and heavy ordnance, flying artillery, mortar practice, use of howitzers, &c.

It is practically a defeat of the rebels, not only in depriving them of a chance of having on the sea vessels with which they might, perhaps, even venture to attack our blockading fleets, but in preventing what they have striven most assiduously to bring about, viz.: a collision between our country and England. There can be no doubt that the wisest men in both countries felt that there was possible danger that such a collision might spring out of some such cause. We, therefore, are very ready to rejoice over the result of this ""unpleasant and complicated affair."" It is an indication to us that the English Government is really desirous of performing the obligations of that neutral position which they assumed. It seems also to indicate a feeling among the sympathizers with the rebellion in England, that their hopes for its success are vain. If they had sufficient confidence in being able to get the rams to sea in time to be of any material service to the rebels, they would hardly have consented to abandon their undertaking at this stage. But possibly the news of GRANT's onward march, and the fall of the rebel loan, were sufficient to convince them that they might as well make such a settlement as would be pecuniarily profitable to them, rather than to undergo the expense and toil of a trial which, if successful, could hardly give them the fruits of success in time to be of any advantage to the failing cause which they would be only too glad to prop up.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Rams in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Rams in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/61920770-a921-5cd1-811f-360a41b09733,549,nyt://article/61920770-a921-5cd1-811f-360a41b09733,
"Nominations, the",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/09/archives/the-baltimore-nominations.html,"Nominations, the","The National Union Convention has unanimously declared ABRAHAM LINCOLN to be the candidate of the great Union party for the next Presidency of the United States. This proceeding is not so much a substantive act as a formal expression. The making of the nomination was already virtually accomplished by the people; the convention simply gave form to it. With a single exception, it is the only instance for a generation in which a political National Convention has named its candidate without competition. That exception was the renomination of HENRY CLAY by the Baltimore Whig Convention of 1844. In every other national convention there has been an ardent, and in many cases a very bitter, strife between the supporters of different favorites. This strife sometimes proceeded from a difference in shades of party sentiment, sometimes from sectional or local influences, sometimes from purely personal preferences. If, in the case of Mr. CLAY, there was from the first an absolute unanimity, it came almost entirely from personal considerations. Mr. CLAY had been for very many years the head and front of the Whig party. He had again and again been urged for the regular Presidential nomination of the party, but his preeminent merits were as often set aside in favor of some more ""available"" candidate, so styled. The betrayal of the party by JOHN TYLER brought the party to a universal sense that HENRY CLAY had been unworthily treated, and the convention of 1844 was thus fired with the single purpose of doing justice to its great party champion. It was a personal sentiment that wrought that unanimity. Vast numbers gave themselves up to it, who seriously doubted whether the renomination would not insure the defeat of the party, or whether even if it prevailed, the interests of the party would not suffer under the strong will and stern rule to which it would be subjected. Concern for the party almost entirely disappeared in a concern for HENRY CLAY.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Baltimore Nominations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Baltimore Nominations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62b14e41-003c-5bb1-b77a-0fb9d48a46e9,1117,nyt://article/62b14e41-003c-5bb1-b77a-0fb9d48a46e9,

He attributed their superiority to the greater familiarity with the rifle of the Southern population, and their more thorough acquaintance with woodcraft. The great number of officers killed on our side, and many of them of high rank, makes this view of Southern superiority with the rifle the more probable. And yet, if it be the fact, there is no excuse for any Northern inferiority at this stage of the war. It is well understood that good rifle shooting is as much a matter of science and training as good artillery firing. A thoroughly expert rifleman can be manufactured almost as surely as the rifle itself. He can learn to shoot with remarkable accuracy by rigidly following certain rules, almost without firing a shot. Regiments of men from our cities, who had never seen a rifle, could be trained so as to shoot with the precision of the most practiced Kentucky hunter.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Lessons of War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Lessons of War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/52e64e81-e7e1-55e7-be0b-eb60c382345c,961,nyt://article/52e64e81-e7e1-55e7-be0b-eb60c382345c,

Prince Couza and his Parliament,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/12/archives/prince-couza-and-his-parliament.html,Prince Couza and his Parliament,"Perhaps, since the establishment of the present Moldo-Wallachian Constitution Prince COUZA and his Parliament have agreed about no one thing, save the confiscation of the ""conventual possessions."" Though the creature of the elective assembly, he has been almost always at variance with it. That body is chiefly composed of boyards, or great landed proprietors, who have an instinctive aversion to both reform and absolutism; and who have generally delighted in thwarting the philanthropic schemes of their Hospodar, especially if those schemes were calculated to undermine their own influence. At length the patience of the Prince became exhausted and he determined to bring matters to a crisis. For this purpose he caused a measure to be submitted to the consideration of the assembly, which he knew very well they would reject. The measure in question was a bill to facilitate the acquisition of land by the Moldo-Wallachian peasantry, and, as COUZA had anticipated, the House refused to sanction it. Such was precisely what that wily individual wanted. He had now his enemies completely in his power. They had given him the whip hand of them. They had placed him in the position of a patriot who was laboring for the public good, and themselves in that of obstructives and adversaries of the Commonwealth. The desired crisis was therefore arrived, and while he had so excellent pretext for appealing to the people, COUZA made up his mind to dissolve the chambers and call on the nation to arbitrate between him and his opponents. The decree of dissolution was accordingly issued, and with it appeared an address from the Hospodar himself to the Roumanians, in which his own services to the State and the delinquencies of the assembly, are carefully set forth. ""Having been raised to the throne,"" says he, ""by the unanimous votes of the Elective Assembly, I had a right to expect the cooperation of those who had imposed on me the glorious but difficult task of reorganizing the country."" The princely philanthropist, however, was grievously disappointed, and thus pathetically portrays his wrongs. ""For his devotion to the National cause;"" exclaims he, ""your elected chief, Roumanians has been rewarded with outrage and calumny, and a factious oligarchy has unceasingly obstructed his efforts for the public good."" This is in the ""Cambyses vein,"" and if we knew nothing of the antecedents of COUZA, we might infer the refrom that a modern Alfred had arrived on the banks of the Danube to bless the people of the principalities with his rule. But though the Moldo-Wallachian Hospodar is neither an Alfred nor a Saint Louis, he has nevertheless made out a very plausible case against the Assembly, and will probably succeed in vanquishing the oligarchs at the elections. COUZA's appeal to the people is not properly speaking a coup d'etat, in the French sense of that phrase. It rather resembles that expedient which is occasionally resorted to in England when parties get into a dead lock, and the Government can't move on. On such occasions the minister appeals from parliamentary factions to their constituents, and the result determines whether the men in office are to continue in place, or to resign the administration to the Opposition. The dissolution of the Moldo-Wallachian Chamber is not its annihilation. The composition of the Assembly may be changed by the action of the people, but the Assembly itself will meet again when the arbitraments are past. The fact is, that the constitution conferred on the Moldo-Wallachians by the great Powers in 1858 was extremely defective, and left the royards far too much influence in the Lower Chamber. This undue influence has been invariably used to prevent all attempt at reform and to perpetuate injustice, and if COUZA's coup should lead to the overthrow of the oligarchs, and the infusion of a larger democratic element into the Assembly, the people and the nation will have no reason to regret the result.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prince Couza and His Parliament.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prince Couza and His Parliament.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f4a6740-d867-59eb-9863-d3ee48ef97f6,652,nyt://article/0f4a6740-d867-59eb-9863-d3ee48ef97f6,

One hardly expects to pass the open doors of a class of rum establishments without hearing repeated volleys of the most blasphemous oaths -- oaths employed as often to form a pleasant garnish for the conversation, as for the more intelligible purpose of giving an outlet to passion. But these rum shops have no monopoly of the custom. It pervades society of an order much less outwardly debased; and fast young men of a quasi respectable bearing who affect sports in themselves harmless, render their company altogether revolting by promiscuous and incessant swearing. The evil stares us in the face, and those who would seek to check it can at best but administer a silent reproof by presenting the contrast of a quiet demeanor, and a rigid abstinence from needless expletives or the use of even seemingly inoffensive oaths.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PROFANE SWEARING STATUTORY PENALTIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PROFANE SWEARING STATUTORY PENALTIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f803368-ccff-5664-813f-ae04b742aca1,441,nyt://article/0f803368-ccff-5664-813f-ae04b742aca1,

VANCE, of North Carolina, on the subject of peace, which we published on Monday, reveals a very curious state of mind on the part of both these functionaries. Gov. VANCE says that "" after a careful consideration of the causes of the discontent"" which he acknowledges to exist in his State, he has come to the conclusion ""that it will be impossible to remove it, except by making some effort at negotiation with the enemy."" To this DAVIS replies that it is of no use offering to negotiate with the enemy, that he has three times endeavored to do so, and has in every instance failed to secure even a hearing for his messenger. They both agree that the only terms they can offer to the North now, are those which they have always offered, to let the North alone, if it lets them alone; or, in other words, acknowledges their independence. Gov. VANCE professes to believe that if this were offered again and refused, it would close the mouths of the North Carolina malcontents, and not only this, but strengthen and intensify the war feeling. But it is hardly possible to believe that there is a single man in North Carolina intelligent enough to oppose the war at all, who does not know perfectly well that this proposal to negotiate on the basis of Southern independence has been before the United States Government ever since the war began. There is no white man in the State, we are quite satisfied, so grossly ignorant of the origin and history of the struggle as to flatter himself that the North is fighting for any other reason than its unwillingness to let the South alone; or that, if it changed its mind on this subject, the offer of peace would not first come from it. There is none who does not know what the ""Commissioners"" came to Washington for in the Spring of 1861; what DAVIS sent his ""military officer"" and his Vice-President for, and why these gentlemen were all sent back to Richmond without any response. What can anybody in the South possibly suppose the North keeps 600,000 men in the field for, and submits to terrible bloodshed every week, if it is willing to let the Confederacy alone?

The policeman immediately reported the circumstances to the station-house, and Sergeant POLLEY, with a number of men, went in pursuit of the fugitives. On the northwest corner of Third-avenue and Forty-second street, in O'CARROLL's porter-house, they were found, but they all succeeded in making their escape except O'CARROLL and DENNIS COONAN.

Memorial Diplomatique on United States Prize Courts. The Springbok,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/12/archives/the-french-attack-on-our-prize-courts.html,Memorial Diplomatique on United States Prize Courts. The Springbok,"The second point made by the writer in the Memorial Diplomatique, in his attack upon our prize courts, of which we spoke some days since, is, that contraband cargo does not carry with it the forfeiture of the rest of the cargo, though belonging to the same owner. His argument is, briefly, that while a belligerent has the right to hinder succor from reaching his enemy, he has no right to punish the one who is endeavoring to send that succor, and the confiscation of the cargo which is not contraband, is punishment. ""But,"" he says, ""the transgressor being a neutral, the belligerent possesses no right of jurisdiction over him. He has no right to impose any penalty whatever on a neutral in neutral territory."" The writer does not pretend to cite any authority on this point, except a sentence from HAUTEFEUILLE, which says that ""neutral vessels laden in whole or in part with contraband of war, destined for the enemy, are liable to seizure, but not in an absolute manner,"" -- a remark, be it noted, which does not refer in the least to the other cargo or its ownership. And he disposes of the opposite authorities simply by saying: ""We are aware that some authors have questioned this doctrine, but their arguments are easily refuted."" Among these authors thus summarily disposed of, we may name BYNKERSHOEK, VALIN, KENT, WHEATON, STORY, Lord STOWELL, PHILLIMORE, PRATT, HAZLITT and ROCHE, HALLECK, MOSELEY and WILDMAN. If there is any point of prize law well settled on authority, it is that, as PRATT says, ""the taint of contraband extends to all property on board belonging to the owners of the contraband articles.""

Under MCCLELLAN there was first the turning back of the retreating enemy, and of his falling upon our front corps near Williamsburgh, before the other portion of the line could be got forward in support -- a battle which, with any decent generalship, ought to have been a decided victory for us with comparatively little loss. Then followed the surprise of Fair Oaks, where a corps thrown out in the air is overwhelmed, and our army, cut in two by a river, is attacked in detail; then the bold raid of STUART, and finally the flank attack by JACKSON, and the greater part of LEE's army on one wing of ours -- the other wing remaining comparatively idle. And still further on, the bold rear assault by JACKSON on POPE's army, and the cutting up of portions of our forces again in detail. Then came the rebel escape from Antietam, which was equal almost to a defeat of our army; still later the surprise of the Eleventh Corps, badly placed in an exposed position at Chancellorsville, and HOOKER's retreat. And yet again, the escape of LEE from Gettysburgh.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New strategy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New strategy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/faee9b86-3734-55d8-b0d4-c6c9d781bd1c,939,nyt://article/faee9b86-3734-55d8-b0d4-c6c9d781bd1c,

The Board of Councilmen adopted resolutions complimentary and of thanks to FRANCIS MAHEDY, THOMAS MCGRATH and THOMAS TYLER, members of Enginne Company No. 31, for gallant conduct in saving life at a recent fire in Division-street. A resolution was adopted requesting the Comptroller to reserve $5,000 of the City Contingent Fund, to be expended in welcoming home the three years' regiments belonging to this City, who have returned, and those yet return this Summer. The Comptroller was requested to report what regulations exist for running the Eighty-sixth-street ferry to Astoria. Two veto messages were received from the Mayor, one on the resolution to procure official badges for the Police Justices, and the other on the resolution directing the Corporation Council to take proceedings to open certain up-town streets on the West side of the City. The first, he says, involves a needless expense, and the second he regards as untimely and unnecessary, and says besides, that several remonstrances to it of property owners interested have been presented to him.

"Dirt???or, Iron-clad; Description of",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/14/archives/the-great-ocean-ironclad-dictator-first-experiment-on-board.html,"Dirt???or, Iron-clad; Description of","It having leaked out in naval circles that the immense engines of the great ocean iron-clad Dictator would be moved for the first time yesterday, no little interest was felt in a large portion of the community, and about 9 or 10 o'clock groups of foreign and American naval officers and of professional men generally might have been seen in the neighborhood of the Delamater Iron Works. Although the fact that steam was to be applied to the machinery had not been communicated to the reporters, the press was not entirely without representation, Before noon it was announced, by the arrival of a gentleman from Mr. ERICSSON, that the raising of steam was to be postponed entirely -- the contractor having determined not to delay the progress of the vessel by any mere formal test, as the Government is known to have expressed a desire to have the vessel completed for active duty as soon as circumstances will permit. No sooner had this information been vouchsafed than our reporter determined to make some inquiries as to the progress of the ship, and he immediately discovered that a still more important operation had been completed and might be inspected. This was nothing less than the successful arming of the ship with the immense new Ericsson guns, of which so much has been surmised that a brief description will not be out of place. It is known that the first and second batches of monitors are armed with three kinds of ordnance -- the 11-inch, the 15-inch and the 100-lb. rifle-gun. The first two are of the Dahlgren, and the latter of the Parrott type. The Ericsson 9-inch differs from all these as widely as the imagination can conceive. It is, in fact, so novel and revolutionary in its character that its success will, in Europe at least, be looked upon as a national matter. Capt. ERICSSON is said to have entered into a contract with the Government to guarantee that his gun will burn over fifty pounds of powder, while the 15-inch Dahlgren, when throwing a 450-pound shot during DUPONT's attack upon Charleston, only burned thirty-five pounds. The British 68-pounder (of 12,500 lbs.,) said by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge to be the most powerful gun in the service, with sixteen pounds of powder, near one-fourth of fifty pounds, has an initial velocity of 1,800 feet per second, and therefore a punching power against iron plates of 27,000 pounds. The rifled gun, with charges of one-tenth to one-twelfth of the shot, and the 15-inch gun with a charge of 35 pounds to its shot of 425 pounds, have velocities varying from 1,100 to 1,400 feet per second. The 300-pound Parrott has, therefore, a punching power of 49,000 pounds, and the 15-inch gun of 55,000 pounds. The new gun, with 75 pounds charge, (one-third of the weight,) will have as great velocity as the 68-pounder, and its punching power 55,000, or exactly double that of the English gun. With 100 pounds of powder, its velocity should be raised to 2,000 feet, and its punching power will be 68,000 pounds, or 340 tons. It can be seen at a glance, that if a piece of ordnance of this magnitude can be successfully constructed, naval artillery is years ahead of the science of building war ships, for there is no craft in the world which would not be fairly capsized by a blow from a ball striking her with a force of 300 tons. The importance of the forthcoming experiment to the Dictator may therefore be imagined.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Ocean Iron-clad Dictator.; FIRST EXPERIMENT ON BOARD REVOLVING THE TURRETS WITH THE IMMENSE NEW ARMAMENT DESCRIPTION OF THE VESSEL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Ocean Iron-clad Dictator.; FIRST EXPERIMENT ON BOARD REVOLVING THE TURRETS WITH THE IMMENSE NEW ARMAMENT DESCRIPTION OF THE VESSEL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5900d845-7a6f-5d96-bc06-a775122893f0,905,nyt://article/5900d845-7a6f-5d96-bc06-a775122893f0,

The clause to the effect that the committee should not proceed till $500,000 were subscribed was stricken out and then the ordinance was adopted; and also a resolution directing the committee to resume recruiting as soon as they shall obtain official surety that all the men they enlist shall be allowed in the next quota. The committee say another call for 300,000 men is likely to be made by July 1, and that the quota of this City will be between 10,000 and 12,000 men. At present there is an excess of 66 men allowed by the Government over all calls heretofore made; but the committee claim an excess of 1,415. Since the 1st of last August, 32,877 men have been enlisted in the City, of whom 21,133 received the bounty. For bounties, $5,660,746 have been expended; for all expenses incident to the work of the Committee, $175,646 90, leaving a cash balance of $639,577 10 on hand, out of $6,946,700, which is the whole sum raised for their use. The Committee also say that a new enrollment will aid in reducing the expected new quota, and they solicit citizens to help in the work of effecting a thoroughly correct enrollment. The Comptroller reported a balance of only $46,333 68 of the $1,200,000 appropriated for the payment of riot damages, and transmitted an ordinance appropriating the further sum of $700,000 authorized by law to be raised, and it was adopted.

He has been reinforced, according to the statements of his friends, by more than 80,000 since that time, viz.: STANTON says he sent him 25,000 veterans after the battle of the 12th of May; BUTLER has sent him 20,000, and prisoners say he has received 40,000 from Ohio and other sources, making a total of 85,000. Yet his army, at this day, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, does not greatly exceed 100,000 men, and is, certainly, greatly, inferior in numbers to what it was when he started on his crusade. He lost 75,000 in Spottsylvania, and his losses in Hanover cannot have fallen very far short of 25,000. Thus he has sacrificed 100,000 men, the flower not only of his own troops, but of the whole United States army. In return, he has effected nothing, absolutely nothing. LEE's entire loss since the campaign opened does not amount to 17,000, all told, killed, wounded and missing. He has never once been forced from a position, and has only fallen back when his enemy, despairing of victory, has attempted to slide off to his left, and get in rear, without further fighting. GRANT in the meantime has been brought up before MCCLELLAN's old lines beyond the Chickahominy, and is not able to take a single step in advance.

"NIBLO's SALOON. -- An interesting concert will be given et this establishment to-night, in aid of a very meritorious object. It is for the benefit of the widow of Lieut. FRANK B. BOUDINOT -- one of the brave fellows who met his death at the battle of the Wilderness. Lieut. BOUDINOT was formerly connected with the Academy of Music, but became a volunteer in the cause of his adopted country.

"Congress, Adjournment of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/15/archives/the-adjournment-of-the-rebel-congress-the-financial-difficulties.html,"Congress, Adjournment of the","Notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Richmond papers, the rebel Congress has adjourned, after a brief session, without a serious attempt to relieve the financial embarrassments of the Jeff. Davis Government Secretary MEMMINGER has made a public statement that he has not a dollar in the treasury wherewith to pay the soldiers. Nor are there any means of meeting the other current expenditures. The enormous taxes which have been levied have been only partially paid; and these payments, having been made in the almost worthless currency, are of little avail. Certificates of indebtedness are not a practicable resort; based on nothing but an airy promise, they command no confidence. The sale of bonds, for the same reason, makes no progress, except as they are hawked at public auction. We publish in another column an official advertisement for the sale at auction of five millions of six per cent. bonds, of late issue, ""secured by a pledge of import and future export duties,"" with other peculiar inducements. Among these inducements is the generous offer to take payment in ""treasury notes of the old issues, of the denomination below one hundred dollars, rated at two-thirds the amount promised on the face."" It seems to be assumed that a Government which is willing to sell its promissory paper for other promises of its own, with the deduction of only a third, is a Government that ought to inspire a great deal of gratitude and confidence. Yet Americans, whether loyal or rebel, will cling to their old-fashioned notions that it is not business-like to trust men who don't pretend to honor their engagements in full measure. If MEMMINGER's five millions were actually sold at public auction on the 26th of May, as advertised, they must have gone dog-cheap. It is not singular that directly afterward should come the announcement that the treasury is without a dollar.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Adjournment of the Rebel Congress The Financial Difficulties Unsolved.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Adjournment of the Rebel Congress The Financial Difficulties Unsolved.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3892294c-81d2-5522-926e-9564386b72f6,1198,nyt://article/3892294c-81d2-5522-926e-9564386b72f6,

"-- One of the most extensive robberies ever committed in New-Haven occurred in this city yesterday noon. It was no less than the summary appropriation of &#194;&#163;1,039 in English sovereigns and half-sovereigns, from the residence of Capt. H.J. BOWN. No. 11 Liberty-court. Capt. BOWN arrived in New-York on Wednesday last from Southampton, in the steamship Bremen. On the passage he made the acquaintance of JAMES JOHNSON and JOHN PENNOCK, of London, and WILLIAM GILL, of Bradford, Yorkshire. The acquaintance ripened into friendship, and on Saturday Capt. BOWN invited his English friends to come up to New-Haven and spend the Sabbath, Messrs. GILL and JOHNLON owned this bag of gold, with which they proposed to start some kind of business in this country. PENNOCK was destitute of money, but being a friend, he was brought over at their expense, with the intention also of establishing in business. Previous to coming to New-Haven, Capt. BOWN advised Messrs. GILL and JOHNSON to place their money in the bank for safe keeping. They acted on the suggestion but partially, and brought the balance with them. The gold was in a bag, the bag inclosed in a satchel, and all left under a bed in one of Capt. BOWN's chambers. Yesterday afternoon, BOWN, GILL and JOHNSON started off for a walk. PENNECK complained of headache and remained at the house. Returning after an hour or two, Mr. JOHNSON casually looked for his treasure, and discovered that the bag had been out and the money gone. Mr. PENNOCK was also missing. The police were immediately notified, and the usual precaution taken to secure the thief, but thus far unsuccessfully. A friend of all parties, an Englishman, named JOHN TIFFIN, was arrested in the afternoon as an accomplice, but there being no evidence against him he was discharged. At the present rate of gold, the thief is in upward of $10,000. There is a good opportunity for experienced detectives to show their expertness. -- New-Haven Journal, June 14.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/15/archives/extensive-robbery-in-newhaven-5195-gold-stolen.html,,"-- One of the most extensive robberies ever committed in New-Haven occurred in this city yesterday noon.

Troops are being raised and drilled all over the country. Peruvian agents have been sent as far as California to procure the materiel of war; an iron-clad is in process of construction at Callao, and at that place important defensive works are in course of construction. The United States of Colombia formally declare that they will make common cause with Peru. In Valparaiso the authorities have forbidden the exportation of provisions, coals, &c., for the Spanish fleet in the Pacific; and the Government had also put an embargo on a vessel with a large quantity of powder on board, supposed to be for Admiral PINZON's fleet.

All classes of citizens, all parties were represented, and all united in a glad and enthusiastic recognition of the patriotic services, the stern integrity, and the tried ability of President LINCOLN, and in warmest approval of the selection as his coadjutor of the tested and trusty patriot, ANDREW JOHNSON. The opening of the campaign, in this meeting, indicates the Union success. It foreshadowed, the uprising of men, the length and breadth of the country, undirected by party leaders, untrammeled by party feeling and prejudices, devoted solely to the safety of their country, the cause of the Union. Never has there been so unmistakable a demonstration. It was almost impromptu, too, for but brief notice had been given of the meeting to the loyal thousands assembled.

Ministerial Crisis in,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/17/archives/another-crisis-in-canada.html,Ministerial Crisis in,"-- There is another crisis in Canada, the result of a vote of the House of Assembly censuring the present Minister of Finance for a mal-appropriation of public moneys five years ago. The money in question was handed to the Grand Trunk Railway by a roundabout process. The facts were developed some time ago in the report of the Financial Commission, and the radical Opposition in Parliament have just found themselves strong enough to pass a sort of non-confidence vote, specially directed against the offending Minister. The practice of singling out a particular Minister for parliamentary censure is not an unusual one in England. The Duke of Newcastle's administration of the War Office during the Crimean campaign is one of the most notable cases in point. So that the Provincials, for once, are backed up in their faction fights by the parliamentary usages of the Imperial Parliament.

Its Northern friends are doing it but a poor service in seeking to prolong its agony. They are doing the country a worse service yet.

"The news this morning is of a very definite and satisfactory character. Gen. GRANT's rapid movement to the south side of the James River, has already brought forth very important results. Gen. SMITH, who moved on Wednesday morning, at 2 A.M., attack Pettersburgh met the enemy in their works and after a severe fight, lasting, with interruptions, until dark that evening, he succeeded in carrying the two principal lines of works in front of that city, capturing from three to four hundred prisoners and sixteen cannon. This important success put the city at once under our guns, and compelled the enemy to evacuate it, which they did, moving westward across the Appomattox. The place had been defended by BEAUREGARD and WISE. In the action the colored division of Gen. HINKS took a prominent part, displaying the greatest gallantry. They stormed the strongest portion of the rebel line, took many prisoners and six of the sixteen guns. Gen. SMITH publicly thanked them for their essential service. By dark of Wednesday, Gen.

"THE LATE HOMICIDE AT PIER NO. 3 NORTH RIVER. -- An inquest was held yesterday by Coroner WILDEY on the body of JOHN BRENNAN, the young man who was stabbed late on Tuesday afternoon last at Pier No. 3 North River, by HENRY HAWKER, an account of which has appeared in the TIMES. HAWKER was a steward and deceased a sailor on board the steamship Northern Light during her last trip to this port. While at sea they became involved in a quarrel, and it was finally agreed that the matter should be settled between them by a free fight, without weapons of any kind, as soon as the two landed in New-York. The testimony in the case showed that as soon as the two belligerents reached the pier HAWKER, in violation of his agreement not to use weapons, ran up to deceased with a knife and stabbed the latter in the left breast, from the effects of which he died soon after.

HAWKER was a steward and deceased a sailor on board the steamship Northern Light during her last trip to this port.

Citizens' Association Reforms,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/18/archives/the-new-city-reform.html,Citizens' Association Reforms,"Amid the absorbing interest in the progress of the war the public have hardly had leisure to notice a great and beneficent work of peace that has been going on in our City. The ""Citizens' Association,"" it will be remembered, was founded by some of our most eminent citizens, during the past year, for the purpose of securing a pure, efficient and economical City Government. Their labors in Albany to reduce the tax-levy, during the last Winter, are well known to the public. Beside this, they have already formed a large and permanent organization in the various Wards of the City, in order to present candidates of honesty and character, who, if elected, will benefit the community instead of robbing it. Each Ward is to have an executive Committee of 100 persons, representing all classes and conditions within it; of this number each election district will furnish 8 or 9 who will again subdivide the district into blocks, and whose duty it will be to visit every voter, and thus influence him to join the Association or elect its candidates. In this way each Ward will be thoroughly organized, every voter will be known, and the members of the Association will attend the polls, so as to prevent all illegal voting. When this organization is fully completed through the city, there will be some two thousand persons engaged, without regard to politics, in securing the election of honest, upright and competent men for the various offices of our Municipal Government. There will be then a mighty organized force in New-York whose aim is honesty, purity and justice in our municipal affairs. The reform movement, which has made so many spasmodic efforts during the last fifteen years, will then be warmly supported by the masses of intelligent mechanics and small property holders, who see in it the lightening of their burdens and taxes, and it will be pecuniarily propped up by the wealthy classes, who will have learnt by bitter experience that such a movement is absolutely necessary for their interests.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New City Reform.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New City Reform.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fa91da76-ead9-5212-b626-44582cb4d98b,932,nyt://article/fa91da76-ead9-5212-b626-44582cb4d98b,
Grant's Operations,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/18/archives/the-latest-army-operations.html,Grant's Operations,"Operations have been commenced in earnest south of the James. The entire army under Gen. GRANT has made a safe and speedy crossing, in compact order, and at a point almost within sight of what must be the scene at last of a stupendous and decisive struggle. Discarding a premature telegram, announcing the entry of Gen. W.F. SMITH into Petersburgh on Thursday, we find in the official dispatches addressed to the War Office sufficient evidence of successes achieved to silence even the most persistent cavilers. Gen. SMITH appears to have led the advance from the south bank of the James, having started direct for Petersburgh, with 15,000 men, at early dawn on Wednesday morning. By 4 o'clock in the afternoon of that day, SMITH had carried a line of intrenchments at a place named Beatty's House, the colored troops being conspicuous for the dash and gallantry with which they assaulted and carried the rebel works. At this time HANCOCK's Corps was within three miles of SMITH, and was hurrying forward to his support. Before, however, any assistance had arrived the gallant Eighteenth had carried the enemy's principal line in front of Petersburgh, and before night had closed in, on Wednesday, Gen. SMITH had gained a position commanding Petersburgh, two miles from the town, and had captured thirteen cannon, several stand of colors, and between three and four hundred prisoners.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Latest Army Operations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Latest Army Operations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fdbc88c3-4a48-5ac1-8e09-35e88bf8859c,614,nyt://article/fdbc88c3-4a48-5ac1-8e09-35e88bf8859c,

The exhibitions on the Battery are the work of two sailors, said to be Portuguese, and are apparently intended merely for their own amusement, though the men are not averse to receiving small donations of postage stamps. Their contortions are quite wonderful, and the manner in which they cast off their jackets without other movement than a species of muscular spasm, not using their hands in the least, is really singular, reminding one of the way in which a snake digests himself of his skin in August. One of these men is talkative and agreeable. He calls himself ZAN-ZAN, and says the other is his mate.

Two sets of resolutions were proposed, the textual difference between which, so far as we have been able to analyze them, consisting mainly in the emphasis of certain expletives employed for the purpose of characterizing the agents of the rebellion. The pith and marrow of the resolutions -- that which really gave them purpose and meaning -- is as well brought out in what we take to be the ""Conservative"" set, whose adoption followed the discussion, as in the less temperate substitute offered by the minority. Thus, while the radical portion of the convention proposed to formally, ""as a body of Christian men, pledge to the Government their prayers, sympathy, and support,"" the majority proposed, ""that we hereby declare our unfaltering allegiance to the Government of the United States, that we pledge it our willing devotion and service, and that as a body of Christians we will ever pray that in God's own time and way this rebellion may be put down, and that oppression and Slavery in all its forms may be done away.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Church and State.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Church and State.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31022cad-1d39-597e-9d7f-169f460d8f70,937,nyt://article/31022cad-1d39-597e-9d7f-169f460d8f70,

"A UNITED STATES DEPUTY MARSHAL CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING. -- Yesterday morning Mr. LOUIS BENJAMIN, a commission merchant of New-York, preferred a charge before Judge COURSOL against G.H. SMITH, of New-York. Deputy United States Marshal, for an attempt to kidnap him. About two months ago Mr. BENJAMIN was arrested in New-York on a charge of shipping goods from New-York to Nassau, N.C., for the blockade-running [???]e. He was imprisoned in Fort Lafayette, where he remained two months, and was then brought before Gen. DIX and was committed to gaol. He was allowed to visit New-York and his family residing there.

A prolongation of the armistice for fifteen days, was agreed to, and a greater disposition to compromise was manifested on the part of the neutral and German representatives. England, satisfied that without concession on all sides, the Conference might as well break up, abandoned all idea of maintaining the integrity of the Danish monarchy, and proposed that the Teutonic, or extreme southern, portion of Schleswig should be severed from Denmark, and annexed to Holstein. This proposition appeared acceptable in the main to the German plenipotentiaries, though different views prevailed as to how the line of demarkation should run, the diplomats of the mediating Powers insisting that the Schlei and the Dannewirke ought to be the northern boundaries of the ceded territory, while their opponents wanted to encroach still further on Denmark, by so directing the line as to give Flensburg and Duppell to the newly created State.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Dano-German Conference.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Dano-German Conference.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ada9720c-f81c-5144-87bd-e800ed6c914c,565,nyt://article/ada9720c-f81c-5144-87bd-e800ed6c914c,

"Grant's Army, Butler, Lee",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/20/archives/the-situation.html,"Grant's Army, Butler, Lee","If the news from Gen. GRANT's army which we publish this morning fails to meet the expectations of the more sanguine portion of the community it must be put to the account of those conjectural reports which were allowed to come over the wires in advance of the succinct and modest statement forwarded to the War Office by the Lieutenant-General himself. The story of the fall of Petersburgh received here on Saturday, was the invention of an over-excited reporter. Its transmission by telegraph was little less than an unpardonable folly, especially when viewed in the light of the stupendous character of the movement which the army had to undertake before it had even secured its base south of the James. A careful examination of Gen. GRANT's report of that movement will enable even those least versed in military affairs to appreciate the extent and character of the labor which had to be gone through before the army gained its present position. Gen. GRANT started from LEE's immediate front at Cold Harbor, at a point within fifty yards of the enemy's intrenchments; marched the main body of his army, by a flank movement, a distance altogether of fifty-five miles, and crossed the James where it is two thousand feet wide, and eighty-four feet deep, ""without the loss of a wagon, or a piece of artillery,"" and leaving altogether but about 150 stragglers, to be picked up by the rebel cavalry. Simultaneously, SMITH's corps was transferred to its new position with no loss whatever, and arrived at Bermuda Hundred so thoroughly refreshed and prepared for duty, as to be able on the very night of its landing to take up its march direct from the river to Petersburgh, and to surprise and capture, the same night, the strong fortifications northeast of Petersburgh before LEE knew enough of the situation to order forward supports to BEAUREGARD. These herculean tasks surely needed no supplementary coloring from imaginative delineators. But even had it been necessary to enlarge the record in favor of the Lieutenant-General and his noble army, there was sufficient to be said without going a single step into the realms of fancy. We see now, for instance, on reading SHERIDAN's report, how brilliantly conceived that expedition was, viewed merely as a diversion in favor of the movement of the main army. That LEE was effectually deceived as to the scope of SHERIDAN's advance, is apparent in various ways -- first, in SHERIDAN's report of the strong infantry force he found brought to within five miles of Gordonsville, and occupying a strongly intrenched position -- second, in the fact of LEE's having failed to press as he might, and with terrible effect, upon GRANT's right flank, in the long roundabout march from Cold Harbor to the James -- and, third, in the weakness of BEAUREGARD's forced when SMITH attacked his intrenchments on Wednesday, northeast of Petersburgh.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Situation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Situation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/20c4f2b8-7be5-5e26-97a5-a24283d69097,973,nyt://article/20c4f2b8-7be5-5e26-97a5-a24283d69097,

The benefit of Miss JANE COOMBS on Wednesday evening last, was a graceful tribute to that charming actress, who has nearly overcome the habit of artists who have been starring for any length of time, viz., hurrying through her own part glibly, without giving the other performers, by waiting for them to make their points, an opportunity of appearing to advantage. She has one other fault which needs correction, viz., excessive modulation of the voice which causes the utterance of many of her passages more strongly to resemble a vocal recitative, than a spoken dialogue. This was unpleasantly, manifested throughout her rendition of Juliet in the ""Hunchback,"" which play will be repeated this evening. The changes being rung during the balance of the week, are ""The Wife's Secret,"" ""The Follies of a Night,"" ""A Bachelor or Arts,"" and ""Rosedale.""

They secured about £900 of the gold, paid FERGUSON $400 reward, and came back contented. During the forenoon, FREEMAN, the barber, informed officer KENNEDY of his interview with PENNOCK, and stated that he believed the thief was at Centreville. The officer had not then heard of the recovery of the gold, and be immediately started for Hamden. Arriving at FERGUSON's house, PENNOCK was found, partially intoxicated. KENNEDY arrested him after some resistance, took him into the house of CHARLES DICKERMAN, when the latter harnessed up and brought them to New-Haven.

The $300 Exemption Clause,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/21/archives/the-results-of-volunteering-and-the-300-exemption-clause.html,The $300 Exemption Clause,"The House Military Committee had yesterday under consideration the subject of commutation in connection with the new Conscription Bill, and it is understood that a majority of the committee favor the repeal of the $300 exemption clause. It is doubted, however, and we think with a fair show of reason, whether the House will sustain the views of the majority. If Senator WILSON reports the facts correctly, when he states that, mainly by means of volunteering, the Government has raised, within a period of little more than eight months, not less than six hundred thousand men, there is an argument presented in favor of maintaining the law as it stands, which we take to be altogether too cogent, practical and to the point, to be set aside merely to sustain an abstract theory of the policy of retaining a fixed rate of commutation. It is true, a very large portion of the six hundred thousand recruits of whom Mr. WILSON speaks, are reenlisted men. But that fact, so far from detracting from the merits of the argument, brings out its force, in the strongest possible light. It shows that the United States service, mainly sustained as it has been by volunteering, presents a claim upon those who have entered it, which would be altogether wanting in the case of an absolute conscription. Of the vast body of reenlisted soldiers, there was not a man who had not in the first instance volunteered for the army. And in so far as the exemption fee established under the existing act has tended to maintain the volunteer character of the service, by furnishing a fund for the dispensation of liberal bounties, it has been an unquestionable support to the military requirements of the Government.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Results of Volunteering and the $300 Exemption Clause.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Results of Volunteering and the $300 Exemption Clause.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/223b9fa7-fe3c-538f-87b9-21900882a0ba,764,nyt://article/223b9fa7-fe3c-538f-87b9-21900882a0ba,

The facts of the case, so far as they can be ascertained previous to the inquest, are as follows: An officer of the Twelfth Precinct was called upon Sunday morning to arrest a disorderly character on the corner of Third-avenue and One Hundred and Twenty-fourth-street. The latter was taken into custody, and the policeman started to the Station-house with him. He had proceeded but a short distance, when a gang of roughs numbering about thirty, attacked the officer, and made a determined effort to rescue the prisoner. An alarm was given, and a roundsman and two other officers immediately made their appearance. A severe struggle then ensued, during which KENNEDY, the deceased, seized a stone of four or five pounds weight, and threw it at the head of the officer who made the arrest. The missile missed its aim, and struck the prisoner, knocking him down. The roundsman, who saw the murderous assault by KENNEDY, instantly struck the latter a blow with his club, from the effects of which he died at the hospital as above stated. A partial examination made after death, showed that the skull was fractured. Deceased was 22 years of age, and had been in this country fifteen months.

The trot is much talked about not only in sporting circles, but among the general public, who have no financial interest in the result, but who delight to witness such gallant struggles between such noble animals as the above three. Few among the teeming thousands who were on the course last week will be absent, and their places will be more than filled by those who were absent then, but would not be on any account to-morrow. The last race was in harness -- the coming one is to waggons, and which will prove the better in the change of vehicle remains to be proved. The idle rumor that Fillingham would not start, we can contradict on the authority of his owner, who asserts that he is well and fit -- and the supporters of the horse aver that he will beat Butler this time. The latter is a notoriously good waggon horse, and his party say he is sure to repeat his triumph -- whilst the Morgan party declare he will make the race far too warm to be agreeable to either of the other two.

The testimony in the case all tended to corroborate the statements already published, with one exception. It had been reported that Roundsman MCCRUM, of the Twelfth Precinct, was the person who inflicted the deadly wounds on the head of deceased. MCCRUM was sworn on the inquest, and in his testimony he positively denies having struck deceased. None of the witnesses were able to tell who committed the deed. The jury rendered the following verdict: ""We find that the deceased, PATRICK KENNEDY, came to his death at the hand of some person unknown, on the morning of the 19th inst., at about the hour of 1 1/4 o'clock; the evidence being of an unsatisfactory character. The jury also recommend the closing of PETER MOUSAIRS's, and like establishments, before the hour of 12 on Saturday nights.""

All local jealousy is swallowed up in the general sense of the propriety of making special recognition of the peculiar desert of Southern loyalty.,,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Candidate for the Vice-Presidency Popularity of the Nomination.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Candidate for the Vice-Presidency Popularity of the Nomination.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3ebf5d3b-c8b6-5488-9888-f1a9d7d9c78d,1037,nyt://article/3ebf5d3b-c8b6-5488-9888-f1a9d7d9c78d,

Movement to Supply Men,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/22/archives/rxemption-from-the-draft.html,Movement to Supply Men,"A movement has been already commenced among some of the wealthier citizens of NewYork for the supply of men for the army, and in advance of the draft. And it is understood that many will subscribe who are exempt, either on account of age or for physical disability. It is highly desirable, for social as well as political reasons, that this should be kept up and carried on. There is nothing better calculated to produce discontent with the war and hostility to the Government, among the poor, than any appearance on the part of the rich of an indisposition to share the burdens of the struggle. The conscription is a tax, which, arrange it how we will, bears unequally on different classes of the community. There are no means of making it otherwise by any legislative provision. It is not possible to arrange matters so that when a man is wanted out of every ten, that each of the ten shall furnish a tenth part of him. The nearest approach the Government can make to the equal distribution of the burden, is to select its recruits by lot. Whatever is done to mitigate the inevitable hardships of the law, must be done by the voluntary efforts of individuals. The Government has to consider the national welfare above all things. Private griefs are nothing to it. It has to leave the right of furnishing substitutes to everybody who has got money enough to pay for them, as the only means of sparing that class of the community whose labors are of most value to the nation, and who, once lost, cannot readily be replaced; namely, those who work with their brains -- who do the planning and directing of the national industry.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rxemption from the Draft.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rxemption from the Draft.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4e23d235-a1c9-5af8-86f6-bb03e39cf006,721,nyt://article/4e23d235-a1c9-5af8-86f6-bb03e39cf006,

Speech at N. Y. Ninth Ward Union Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/22/archives/local-intelligence-ninth-ward-ratification-meeting.html,Speech at N. Y. Ninth Ward Union Meeting,"A ratification meeting of the Ninth Ward Lincoln and Johnson Campaign Club was held Monday evening at the Bleecker Building, Mr. KEECH presiding. A series of resolutions, indorsing the Baltimore nominations, were read and unanimously adopted. The Chairman stated that Gov. WRIGHT, of Indiana, who was expected to attend, was not present, but that he had the pleasure of introducing Hon. HENRY J. RAYMOND, who although suffering from indisposition had consented to comply with the request of the committee to address the meeting. Mr. RAYMOND, after the cheers which greeted him had subsided, said he did not think he would have attempted to speak that evening on any political topic, except at the old Ninth Ward. He referred to his early associations with the Ward, remarking that his first advent into public life was there. He knew that in the din of war it seemed like breaking in upon the affairs of the hour to speak of politics, but in the present campaign campaign we had to decide that war. The object of the nation had not been accomplished, the rebel armies had not been dispersed, and much depended upon the character of the Government. The Baltimore Convention had placed in nomination good and true men who would support that Government, and it had taken into consideration that ABRAHAM LINCOLN had been President for three years; that he had been surrounded by difficulties even greater than WASHINGTON, and had always been steadfast in his purpose to preserve the Union. He (the speaker) remembered the time when they met to advocate the election of ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Then it was not thought the South could plunge this country into civil war, but at the very threshold of going into power the Administration met with rebellion. The President had first, last and always called upon the people. Some thought he ought to have marked out a distinct path for the people, but the exigencies of the times had never been lost sight of, and the President had never taken a position from which he had receded a single step. The speaker thought that the people had done well in deciding to place ABRAHAM LINCOLN in power for four years more. It was always thought that Slavery was constitutional but local. The South proposed to build up Slavery into a political power, and it became a question between Slavery and the Constitution. A victory won, Slavery would cease forever. Our aim should be to show that the South was wrong, for everything had been done to satisfy that portion of the country that we did not wish to interfere with Slavery; and in that respect the President had done nothing except so far as it was necessary to preserve the Union. In a civil war we must rely upon events to educate the people. When we saw that the South did not believe in our disposition to let Slavery alone, everybody became convinced we must strike a blow at the institution. This was not done hastily. We are now in favor of putting a clause of prohibition of Slavery in the Constitution, so that it may never again be the cause of rebellion in this country. The speaker pronounced a glowing eulogy on the patriotism of the Union men of the South and said that he felt ashamed when their loyalty was questioned. He concluded by saying, that he believed, as far as the prospects were concerned, that, it everything went on fair, ABRAHAM LINCOLN would as surely be reelected as he is now President.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Ninth Ward Ratification Meeting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Ninth Ward Ratification Meeting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e111353-d1c4-536d-957c-a7b0869638d6,943,nyt://article/5e111353-d1c4-536d-957c-a7b0869638d6,

"-It may be computed with reason that LEE's family of consumers has been increased within the last ten days to the tune of full fifty thousand non-combatants, by the advance of our forces south of the James.

The speedy capture of the place is looked forward to by a still larger number, who refrain from meddling with dates, but expect the news of it every week. All this, we need hardly say, is but a repetition of what we have been witnessing ever since the war began. After the commencement of every new movement, if it should be attended with the smallest success, a portion of the public has at once rushed to the conclusion that ""the back of the rebellion was broken;"" that the rebel army was demoralized, and incapable of further resistance. We witnessed this after Mill Spring, after Roanoke, after Fort Donelson, after the fall of New-Orleans, and after that of Vicksburgh. No amount of experience of the risks and uncertainty of war, and of the desperation with which the enemy is fighting, seems sufficient to counteract this most unfortunate tendency to exaggeration.

The ship Kent, which had arrived at London, reports that a boarding officer from the rebel steamer Alabama stated that she had burned a large number of American vessels, and had a great number of prisoners on board. In the House of Lords, the matter of Irish enlistments in the American service was brought up, the Marquis of Clanricarde and Lord BROUGHAM speaking very strongly in opposition to it, and expressing the hope that European Powers would soon interfere, and stop the present war. The Marquis of Clanricarde also stated that it was notorious that Federal recruiting was going on in Ireland. Earl RUSSELL, in reply, defended the conduct of Lord LYONS and himself, but also thought the action of the American Government highly discreditable. He wished that proofs might be furnished that Federal recruiting was going on in Ireland, that the proper parties might be punished. The Times thinks the matter has been greatly exaggerated, and believes the number of men obtained by the Federals from the British isles to be very small, and also that if they had received twice the number, England could not reasonably make it a cause of war, on the ground that the Government cannot prevent emigration, and that if emigration ends in enlistments, that is a matter beyond their control. The Dano-German Conference Committee met again on the 9th inst. The armistice has been extended until the 26th of June. The Germans insist on the lines proposed by them.

Again it is our duty to correct misrepresentation, and to mend bad logic. We did not say that the Confederate bonds, generally, were equal to ours in Europe, but that their Cotton Loan was, whose only value consists in the fact that cotton, in the Southern States, is pledged for its payment, and that the blockade is of so inefficient a character that this cotton can come out to perform its pledged duty. Is not this true? And eannot the Post perceive that the utter worthlessness of the common bonds of the South makes the high value of their ""cotton bonds"" the more striking, since it is evident that there is no general responsibility behind them, but only the certainty that cotton can run the blockade? If Confederate bonds generally were worth as much as ours in Europe, the fact that these cotton bonds were also equally valuable would prove nothing -- otherwise it proves that the blockade is worthless.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Navy and the Blockade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Navy and the Blockade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BLOCKADE', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0488db22-e10b-5654-8c69-a93cf28219bd,711,nyt://article/0488db22-e10b-5654-8c69-a93cf28219bd,

"The recent advent of &#194;&#163;1,039 in gold sovereigns in New-Haven has already made more or less trouble for three Englishmen. But, as many anticipated, the legitimate owners belong in England, and its disappearance has created a good deal of excitement there. It appears that on Thursday of last week, Mr. JOHN E. HUNT, Inspector of the Detective Department at Town Hall, Leeds, arrived in New-York, per steamer Scotia, accompanied by Capt. WARD, an officer connected with the Leeds Banking Company. They were in search of JOHN SPENCE, alias Gill, who, they claim, had absconded with nearly $25,000 belonging to that institution. It appears that, upon arriving here, Mr. SPENCE assumed the name of GILL. The detective first heard of the man at the United States Hotel, in New-York, and subsequently traced him to New-Haven. Here he communicated with the police, and yesterday noon Mr. GILL was taken in custody. Deputy Sheriff MIX, accompanied by Chief of Police POND, made the arrest in Fair Haven, while GILL was returning from a fishing excursion. Mr. GILL was welcomed by the Sheriff with. ""How are you, Mr. SPENCE?"" which cognomen the foreign gentleman had not heard pronounced for so long, that it quite surprised him, He was taken to the station-house where ""lawyers for the Crown"" and ""lawyers for the prisoner,"" were full of business.

But, as many anticipated, the legitimate owners belong in England, and its disappearance has created a good deal of excitement there. It appears that on Thursday of last week, Mr. JOHN E. HUNT, Inspector of the Detective Department at Town Hall, Leeds, arrived in New-York, per steamer Scotia, accompanied by Capt. WARD, an officer connected with the Leeds Banking Company. They were in search of JOHN SPENCE, alias Gill, who, they claim, had absconded with nearly $25,000 belonging to that institution. It appears that, upon arriving here, Mr. SPENCE assumed the name of GILL. The detective first heard of the man at the United States Hotel, in New-York, and subsequently traced him to New-Haven. Here he communicated with the police, and yesterday noon Mr. GILL was taken in custody. Deputy Sheriff MIX, accompanied by Chief of Police POND, made the arrest in Fair Haven, while GILL was returning from a fishing excursion. Mr. GILL was welcomed by the Sheriff with. ""How are you, Mr. SPENCE?"" which cognomen the foreign gentleman had not heard pronounced for so long, that it quite surprised him, He was taken to the station-house where ""lawyers for the Crown"" and ""lawyers for the prisoner,"" were full of business. The result of all this legal advice is, that Mr. SPENCE is now at liberty. It is understood that he produced such funds as he could command, sufficient in fact to satisfy the foreign officers, who were content to take up with a portion. Mr. GILL has conducted himself in a very gentlemanly manner since his debut in this city, and even now insists that the whole affair is the result of misunderstanding on the part of the English officer. -- New-Haven Journal, June 22.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Important Arrest--The Gold Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Important Arrest--The Gold Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d83866d-2131-51ea-9baa-9f03e51b7d0d,307,nyt://article/0d83866d-2131-51ea-9baa-9f03e51b7d0d,

and the Union; the Constitutional Amendment,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/26/archives/slavery-and-the-union.html,and the Union; the Constitutional Amendment,"We trust that we shall receive from those who are opposed to the abolition of Slavery by an amendment to the Constitution, a full and particular statement in the course of the Summer, of the manner in which they expect to see the Union restored and preserved without the abolition of Slavery. As far as we have been able to extract any definite meaning from Democratic speeches and letters on this subject hitherto, they acknowledge Slavery to be a source of danger to the Union, but solely owing to the extreme sensitiveness of the slave owners. Slavery, they say, is the proper condition of the negro, the only one suited to his powers and weaknesses, and the only one in which, as a race, he can receive all development of which he is capable. The strongest argument in its favor is that drawn from his needs. The benefit derived from his labor by the master is, after all, but a secondary consideration. If it were twice as great as it really is, it would be, urge these men, but a poor return for the education and protection bestowed by the master -- not, certainly, the education of books, but that better and more effectual kind, which consists in continuous restraint and judicious punishment. Socially, therefore, Slavery is an unmixed blessing, both for the negro and his owner. Politically, it may, in a Republic such as ours, become dangerous, not through any fault of its own, but through the turbulence and combativeness of its enemies. It becomes a source of anxiety only when the people of the Free States refuse to let it alone. If the North would make up its mind not to meddle with the institution, it would continue to be in the future, what it has been in the past, the great elevator of the negro, and the great enricher of the white man.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Slavery and the Union.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Slavery and the Union.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Slavery', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/311ab907-5299-5932-b60a-f285c25b0f60,967,nyt://article/311ab907-5299-5932-b60a-f285c25b0f60,

As that anniversary comes round again, and they see that GRANT and his army persist in continuing to attack Richmond, when by all rules they ought to be in full retreat; and as the news comes to them of the destruction of the railroads in every direction, their thoughts naturally go back to the Fourth of July of last year, when PEMBERTON surrendered Vicksburgh to the same indomitable man, after a somewhat similar series of performances. The Richmond Examiner, in perhaps not the very best taste, refers to this surrender of PEMBERTON's in an article upon the political prospects of the Summer. JEFF. DAVIS and his protegee PEMBERTON, we should think, would hardly thank the Examiner for the allusion.

"TRIAL TRIP OF THE CHAUNCEY VIBBARD. --This new and swift North River clipper passenger steamer made her first trip from New-York to Albany, on Saturday, the 18th. She unmoored from her berth, foot of Desbrosses-street, at 7 A.M., and reached the dock at Albany at 3:30, having made a passage of remarkable speed, considering the usual disadvantages of foaming boilers, heated journals, &c., attending new engines. Indeed, her time between Rhinebeck and Catskill, one hour and six minutes, was the fastest ever made on the river between these points. From New-York to Rhinebeck, 100 miles, she ran in four hours forty-two minutes, making four landings. Her lines are singularly fine, and she cute the water forward and leaves it aft with almost no disturbance whatever. She made not more than twenty-five or twenty-five and a half revolutions a minute at most, upon her present trip; but experts on board say that without doubt she can make 25 miles an hour with 28 turns, after her machinery and boilers get into working order; and they anticipate that she will be the fastest boat on the river. The Vibbard is 285 feet long over all, 275 feet keel, 34 feet beam, 62 feet over the guards, 9 feet deep 860 tons burden, and draws 4 feet 7 inches of water. She was built for Messrs. VAN SANTVOORD & DAVIDSON, by LAWRENCE & FOULKS, North Fifth-street, Williamsburgh. Her engines are by FLETCHER, HARRISON & Co., and are of their usual style, having all the recent improvements. Her cylinder is of 55 inches diameter, 12 feet stroke; wheels 30 feet diameter. Her joiner work is by King & Eells, painting by Stephen Rogers, ornamental work by Barney & Styles, gilding, mirrors, &c., by J.B. Downing, and upholstery by A.T. Stewart & Co. Her frescoing and decorative finish are in cool and pleasant colors and graceful designs, showing uncommon good taste. Her appointments of every kind are very complete; they are in general of the usual character, one feature only requiring notice. This is her large extent of state-room accommodation secured by throwing into state-rooms the whole after-hold, commonly fitted with berths. The smoothness of the Hudson renders this practicable, permitting window ventilation under the guards. The Vibbard's officers are as follows: Captain, DAVID HITCHCOCK; Mate, Peter Bishop; Clerk, Alonzo W. Collyer; Chief Engineer, Wm.H. Gage; Second Engineer, Lewis Reiffenberg; Pilot, Guernsey Belts; Steward, C. Fairchild Steward John H. Conover of the Armenia was also, on board, and promoted efficiently the pleasure of the trip. Messrs. Van Santvoord, Foulks, and Fletcher, Supervisor Smith of this City, Capt. Peck of the St. John, and other steamboat men of renown, were present. The day was perfect, the guests well pleased, the boat very successful, the cooking and the table very good indeed, the officers attentive in that wisest of ways which enables the guest to feel himself welcome and at home.

The latter testified that she is a resident of New-Brighton, Staten Island; that on Saturday afternoon she came up to the City for the purpose of finding a relative of hers named JAMES WELSH, who she was told lived in the vicinity of Second-avenue and Twenty-second-street; that she was an utter stranger in the City and searched until after dark before she found the street above-mentioned. On the corner she saw the prisoner CONNOLY, and asked him if he could direct her to the house of JAS. WELSH. He at first replied no; but immediately after another man came up, and CONNOLLY spoke a few words to him aside, and then prisoner said to BRIDGET that if she would go with the other man he would put her in the way of finding the person she sought. Complainant suspected nothing wrong, and never, having seen either of them before, she went with the stranger several doors from the corner to a house in Twenty-second-street. They entered a dark hallway and proceeded upstairs to a room, the door of which was unlocked by her conductor, and she was suddenly and rudely thrust into a dark room. Complainant became frightened at this, and felt confident that she was being foully dealt with. She began to scream as loud as possible, when a hand was quickly thrust over her mouth and she was told that, to make any more noise, would be at the peril of her life. The man continued to hold her down, and did all he could to violate her person. In the struggle her clothes were nearly torn from her person, and she was struck several times by the man in order to keep her still. After a time the prisoner, CONNOLY, made his appearance in the room, and he also assailed her, striking her in the jaw with his fist because she would not comply with his demands. The latter finally lighted a lantern which he had brought with him, and, after several gross insults had been offered to her by the men, they both departed, leaving her in the room alone and in the dark. As soon as possible after they had gone, she got out of the building, and finally found her way to the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house, where she told her story, and described the prisoner CONNOLLY so accurately that Officer HUTCHINSON was able soon after to effect his arrest. The other villain has not been secured. Justice LEDWITH committed CONNOLLY for trial in default of $1,000 bail. The prisoner says he is a native of this City, aged 27 years, resides at No. 349 Second-avenue and is by occupation a wire-drawer.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/149982dc-2ff7-5f30-a3d1-5290f6dc6fca,506,nyt://article/149982dc-2ff7-5f30-a3d1-5290f6dc6fca,

British American Confederacy; Steps Toward a,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/27/archives/a-british-american-confederacy.html,British American Confederacy; Steps Toward a,"A Quebec correspondent, whose letter we publish in other columns to-day, gives some particulars supplemental of the telegraphic report, as to the political movements at the Canadian seat of Government. These movements -- if we are to suppose the actors sincere -- are not without interest to the outside world. The faction fights which had brought the Province almost to the verge of anarchy culminated some two weeks ago in the defeat of the Tory Ministry. The latter proposed to appeal from the House of Assembly to the country. But Gov. MONCK, although obliged according to constitutional usage to permit the appeal asked for by his advisers, appears to have urged his Council to make some attempt at cabinet reconstruction before going to the polls. He seems to have feared that a general election would supply no remedy for the sectional antagonism which practically threatened to make common legislation for the Gallic and Anglo-Canadian divisions of the colony impossible. Lord MONCK, doubtless acting according to secret instructions from Downing-street, and under the inspiring influence of the Lombard-street creditors of the Province, is understood to have strongly urged his Ministers to invite a coalition of parties, by making room in the Executive Council for several of the more violent and dangerous members of the Opposition; and he seems indeed to have employed the strongest kind of indirect influence to accomplish his purpose.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A British American Confederacy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A British American Confederacy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c5eca5e-c6c5-5b61-a8cc-81665065694b,1379,nyt://article/1c5eca5e-c6c5-5b61-a8cc-81665065694b,

Magazines for July,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/27/archives/the-july-magazines.html,Magazines for July,"-- The Atlantic Monthly (Boston, TICKNOR & FIELDS,) commences with the present number its fourteenth volume, and bears itself proudly, pointing with complacency to an unrivaled list of contributors as an earnest of what may be expected in continuance of the exertions hitherto so conclusively crowned with success. The first article that most readers will turn to is undoubtedly a chapter, by HAWTHORNE, of the romance that he had been for some time engaged in writing for the Atlantic. Resembling his English cotemporary novelist, THACKERAY, in the circumstances of his decease, there is a further similarity in the fact that the last work of both was for the magazines they had been connected with, and the readers of the Cornhill and the Atlantic have alike seen with sadness the last incomplete efforts of their creative minds. HAWTHORNE's scene from the ""Dolliver Romance"" -- a detached passage elaborated with the finish of a cabinet picture, strikes a chord of psychological romance, which is now mute for a generation, at least. In this walk he had no rivals, and the public would certainly not at present endure mere imitators. ""Glorying in the Goad,"" by GAIL HAMILTON, is full of common sense, and must be taken as a corrective to the pictures of rural elysiums, that are generally the product of a city imagination, ""Saadi,"" by RALPH WALDO EMERSON, is apparently prefatory to the translation of the principal work of that poet, the ""Gulistan, or Rose Garden,"" for some time announced as in preparation by Mr. EMERSON, IK MARVELL, continues his pleasant talks on ""Farming, and Country affairs,"" with agricultural worthies of the last generation. ""Meyerbeer,"" by FRANCIS WILLIAMS, gives some new particulars of that great composer's last days. The poetry, it is enough to say, is contributed by LONGFELLOW, BRYANT, and Dr. O.W.

Deceased had been complaining for several years, but as a general thing he has not been confined to his house. On Saturday he was out, and returned to his residence, No. 155 East Thirty-fifth-street, between 12 and 1 o'clock yesterday morning. He came in a light wagon, accompanied by a friend. He sat on his front stoop about fifteen minutes, when he complained of illness and asked for ice water, which was furnished. Soon after he was taken to bed and continued to grow worse, breathing shorter and shorter and with greater difficulty until 5:30 o'clock yesterday morning, when he expired. Dr. THOMAS ROBINSON made a post-mortem examination of the body. He found the heart very large and fatty, and the pericardium filled and distended with serum. The liver was also very much diseased, and the whole structure of it entirely degenerated into a schirrus mass. The spleen was enormously large, measuring 10 1/2 inches in length, 8 inches in width and weighed several pounds. The doctor was of the opinion that the immediate cause of death was cardiac dropsy.

"The steamship Bavaria, from Southampton 15th inst., arrived at Cape Race yesterday, with two days later advices. The London Times says the comparative ease of the French discount market, and the recovery of the stock of gold in the Bank of France, fail to counteract the chronic distrust of the financial and commercial classes in NAPOLEON's foreign policy. It also says that the high price of gold in New-York indicates the want of confidence the public have in the position of the army in Virginia. A rumor is talked of confidently on 'Change, of the possible break-up of the Cabinet on the Danish question. A Copenhagen dispatch says, that ""The Danish Notables, in an address to the King, intimate that the personal union of Schleswig and Holstein with the kingdom would entail the loss of Schleswig, while the incorporation of the Constitution of Schleswig with that of the kingdom would endanger the independence of Denmark.

Meeting in New-York; Fremont and Cochrane Ratification Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/28/archives/the-fremont-meeting.html,Meeting in New-York; Fremont and Cochrane Ratification Meeting,"The Fremont ratification last night was a curious affair, -- admirably in keeping with the movement itself. It was respectably large, and reasonably enthusiastic, -- but both its size and its enthusiasm were due to everything else than the Fremont element. Inside the meeting seemed to be about equally divided between the friends of MCCLELLAN and those of LINCOLN, -- while outside it was almost exclusively a MCCLELLAN gathering. Occasional cheers were given for FREMONT and COCHRANE, but without any special zest or heartiness. To all intents and purposes it was a Democratic gathering, -- just as the movement itself is neither more nor less than a Democratic demonstration. There was not at the meeting, nor is there anywhere, either in this State or any other, the slightest desire to make FREMONT President -- or the faintest shadow of belief that, upon any ground, personal or political, he ought to be elected. He is used as a willing tool by men who, like himself, have revenges to gratify, or by others who seek a party triumph to aid in the defeat of Mr. LINCOLN. Just now the Democrats are using him to swell the roll of Mr. LINCOLN's enemies. They are trying hard to make it appear that he has a very formidable opposition among those who have formerly been his advocates. When they have made FREMONT sufficiently serviceable in the accomplishment of this purpose, they will throw him aside like any other tool for whom they have no further use. This is the simple meaning of the whole movement.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fremont Meeting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fremont Meeting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/df0c2b9f-de2a-5019-8904-2df0d67d1baa,532,nyt://article/df0c2b9f-de2a-5019-8904-2df0d67d1baa,

Our capitalists are beginning to realize the act that twenty-year bonds of the City, bearing six per cent, interest, will prove a good investment. Nearly a half million dollars have been subscribed at par, or above. The plan adopted by Supervisor BLUNT will be adhered to, and the entire matter of recruiting will be under his immediate supervision. Arrangements with the authorities at Washington have been perfected so that there will be no mistake concerning the manner in which the newly-enlisted men shall be credited to the City under any call of the Government. The want of action on the part of Congress in net deciding as to the repeal or retention of the commutation clause, is an embarrassment in the way of determining what action the Board of Supervisors will take with reference to extra inducements to those desiring to enlist; for should the clause be repealed the prices paid for substitutes would be greater than the county bounty. It is, therefore, necessary to know what action Congress will take in the matter, in order to determine the prospects for rapid enlistments. Although it has been settled that all enlisted men are to be credited to the quota of the County under any new call, yet it is not known what that quota will be, or on what terms the men will be received. There is now an excess in favor of the county, under the old call, of over 1,100 men, which will, of course, be credited to any new quota. The clerks and others who were engaged while the last quota was being filled, although not under pay, are holding themselves in readiness, to resume operations. There are a large number of applications daily at the Park Recruiting Barracks to enlist, all of which are refused, and regretfully so, as hundreds might have been enlisted in anticipation of a new call. It is, however, quite evident that there, will be no difficulty in filling any quota required of the County. The HancocK Substitute Recruiting Committee are doing well, when it is considered that none but aliens are taken.

The premises were mainly occupied by Mr. E. KINGMAN, manufacturer and dealer in cabinet furniture. The fire originated in the varnish room, where one of the men was at work at the rime. The cause of it is, however, unknown at present. The Fire-Marshal is engaged making an investigation as to its origin. The three upper floors were entirely destroyed, and all the lower portion of the buildings badly damaged. Mr. KINGMAN's loss on furniture, fixtures, &c., by fire and water will not fall far short of $40,000. He is insured for $30,000 in the North River, Lenox, Tradesmen's, Atlantic, St. Mark's, New-York, Equitable, Firemen's, Astor and other insurance companies. Mr. T. THOMPSON occupied the corner store as a porter-house. His damage to stock and fixtures by fire and water is about $600; insured for $1,500 in the Jefferson Insurance Company. Mr. L. ST. JOHN, who kept a broker's office on the first floor, was damaged to the amount of $200; no insurance. Mr. R. HUTCHINSON occupied a small store under the buildings on the Baxter-street side as a second-hand clothing establishment. A portion of his stock was removed, but he has sustained a loss of about $300. The buildings were owned by Mr. H.B. HOFFMAN. The loss on them is between $12,000 and $15,000; said to be fully insured in City companies. Capt.

The remaining three, whose names were ascertained to be JAMES CROWDERS, CHARLES DRAKE and J.D. ALLISON, were discovered to be Kentuckians, formerly belonging to the guerrilla band of Gen. MORGAN. They had been captured and confined at Camp Chase, Ohio, but contrived to make their escape into Canada, whence they proceeded by way of Halifax to Nassau. From Nassau they sailed in the blockade-runner Thistle, for Wilmington, with the avowed purpose of rejoining Gen. MORGAN. The capture of the Thistle produced an awkward derangement of their plans, and brought them into the custody of Marshal MURRAY. These facts were elicited by a long and close examination, As the prisoners appeared to be possessed of considerable shrewdness and ability, the Marshal transferred them yesterday to Fort Lafayette, under a guard provided by Gen.

Schools Investigating Committee,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/06/29/archives/the-public-schools-investigating-committee-mittee.html,Schools Investigating Committee,"-- A morning cotemporary gives place to an insinuation against the Investigating Committee of the Board of Education, which can only be characterized as cowardly. The board is praised for its commendable alacrity in ferreting out the iniquities practiced in the Fourth Ward school. But to this is added the sneaking assertion that ""there is an impression abroad that the board shows more zeal in overhauling schools in the Fourth and Sixth Wards, than in those situated in more aristocratic quarters."" The answer to this is plain: The Investigating Committee has been instructed to continue its examination into the condition of the Ward schools generally. It neither shirks nor seeks to postpone that duty. And if, as is alleged in the journal from which we have quoted, the Fifteenth Ward schools need overhauling, why are the complaints relating thereto not lodged with the Board of Education, instead of being carried to the office of a partisan journal, which seeks to screen the evil-doers of the Fourth Ward by representing that the committee, while punishing them, has been careful to spare others? The committee needs no apology or defence put forward in its behalf. But it is right that the public should know the baseless character of the charges leveled at it by the organs of the villanous crew which had possession of the public schools in certain wards before the committee commenced its labors.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.; MITTEE.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.; MITTEE.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/deaa5a85-7c38-5e08-9b51-fa4cf604a4e1,234,nyt://article/deaa5a85-7c38-5e08-9b51-fa4cf604a4e1,

SEMMES has written a long letter to the London Times, explaining why the Confederate cruisers burn their prices, and says they would much prefer sending them for adjudication into the ports most convenient for the parties concerned. The British Government has sent instructions to Governors of Colonies respecting the treatment of prizes captured by Federal or Confederate cruisers, if brought into British waters. The captors shall be notified immediately to depart and remove the prize. If they do not depart at the time prescribed by the Governor, the prize is to be detained until Her Majesty's pleasure shall be made known. A vessel which has been converted into, and used as a public vessel of war, is not to be deemed a prize within the meaning of these rules. The London Times says that a quantity of forged Confederate Bonds of twenty pounds each, have been put incirculation in England, also that an enormous amount of counterfeit Confederate bonds have been received from New-York and put in circulation. The Daily News says that the plot for overturning the Government is believed to have broken down and been abandoned by its authors.

It would seem, therefore, that the only hope now of getting the measure through in any workable form will lie in an acceptance by both Houses of what is the clear, unmistakable judgment of the public that there should be a fixed commutation fee, big or little, And in this matter public opinion, as well as merely official theories, must be consulted, to insure cordial cooperation on all hands in the great work before us.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE SIXTY DAYS' NOTICE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE SIXTY DAYS' NOTICE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-06-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0016e0de-7149-5eea-9233-b3c4af1714eb,153,nyt://article/0016e0de-7149-5eea-9233-b3c4af1714eb,

The Tories have failed to get their courage up to the sticking point in the matter of a vote of censure on the foreign policy of the Government. The trouble of the Opposition, and what makes them so feeble-kneed, is their utter want of sincerity in this matter of standing by Denmark in her unequal struggle for her territorial rights. But for the thorough distrust with which the Liberal friends of the assailed monarchy, in the House of Commons regard the professions of the Tory leaders, the life of the Palmerston Ministry would barely be worth a day's purchase. So long, however, as that distrust remains, there is no prospect of a combination strong enough to supplant the present Cabinet -- unless indeed (which is not improbable) it breaks up from internal dissensions.

"-- The new enrollment, which is now completed, shows an increase of several thousand over the enrollment of last year. This is partially owing to the careful manner in which the different districts have been canvassed, but more particularly to the extraordinary increase of emigration within the past six months of young men, most of whom have declared their intentions, and have settled in the City. The increase of foreign laborers in our iron foundries is alone, within the period mentioned, over 11,000. A large number of these men are liable to draft, and others will join the army as substitutes.

The increase of foreign laborers in our iron foundries is alone, within the period mentioned, over 11,000. A large number of these men are liable to draft, and others will join the army as substitutes.

Yet after that bill was passed, eighteen months ago, it was that very clause which the same party especially used to arouse popular passion against the Government. Their orators on the platform, their newspapers and their street talk were full of fiery indignation at the tyranny which forced the poor man from his family into the ranks, while the rich man was let off by the payment of money. In vain it was urged that the law, by keeping down the price of substitutes, was really for the poor man's benefit -- that by commuting, and so remitting to the Government the business of finding substitutes, personal exemption was placed within the reach of tens of thousands who otherwise would have no alternative but to quit home and serve. The changes were still rung with the utmost fierceness upon the atrocious distinction of the Government against the poor. It was that one act, incessantly kept up, that did more than all things else to produce the New-York riots, with all their terrible scenes of fire and blood. And yet when an effort is made to put an end to the distinction, the representatives of the party plant themselves dead against it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Repeal of the Commutation The Party of Indiscriminate Resistance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Repeal of the Commutation The Party of Indiscriminate Resistance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-06-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7485852-9a6b-52b6-b219-67d320e70f51,750,nyt://article/d7485852-9a6b-52b6-b219-67d320e70f51,
