"On Saturday morning last the rebel Gen. WHARTON, with 2,500 men, made a raid on SHERMAN's rear, and interrupted, for a time, his communications. Five freight trains, loaded with army supplies, were captured between Ringgold and Dalton, and destroyed. The rebel cavalry are very active, and occasionally meet with success. Their chief aim appears to be to raid on the communications of our army. About a week ago Capt. GLOVER made a dash at the railroad five miles from Resaca, and succeeded in capturing and destroying two trains loaded with provisions. SHERMAN feels secure in his position, and his lines are steadily advancing. Fighting occurs every day. The boom of cannon and the rattle of musketry are heard in the early dawn, and the thundering echoes and bright flashes make grand the twilight hour. The rebels hold their strongly fortified position on the Chattahootchie River. SHERMAN will take Atlanta by a dextrously-executed flank movement. We learn from a gentleman just arrived from the front, whose connection with the army affords every facility to learn of its movements, the above facts. He was in Atlanta one week ago, and states that the citizens of that place feel insecure, and are moving further South. The Governor of Georgia is becoming sensitive in regard to the invasion of the State. He is out with a proclamation in the Atlanta papers, warning the Confederate authorities, and JOE JOHNSTON in particular, not to attempt to destroy Atlanta or the railroads extending from the city. He says that they are the property of the State, and he will use every means in his power to preserve them for the State. If necessary, he will call out the militia, and recall the Georgia troops in the Confederate service, to aid him in enforcing his proclamation. This sounds much like buncombe, and we presume it will so be regarded by the Confederate authorities. Our informant says that if JOHNSTON is driven from the Chattahoochie, he will not attempt to make a stand this side or Atlanta, or even at the city. Cedar Bluff, nine miles below the town, has been strongly fortified, and is considered impregnable. JOHNSTON will at once retreat to this position, if forced from his present stand, and will there offer battle. The Bluff can never be taken by assault.

HARDEE's corps is composed of CHEATNAM's, CLEBURN's, WALKER's and BATES' divisions; HOOD's corps, of STEVENSON's, STEWART's and HINDMAN's divisions, POLK's, of LORING's and TENCHS divisions, and another of different commands; and WHEELER's cavalry corps consists of the divisions of KELLY, JACKSON and MARTIN. There are also two independent cavalry divisions, respectively commanded by RODDY and LEE, which act in concert with WHEELER in the field, though distinct in their organizations. The Georgia infantry, or ""Gov. BROWN's pets,"" as they are called, are sold to number between ten and fifteen thousand; they are principally employed in erecting breastworks, and as yet have done but little fighting. The other corps are each said to be about 20,000 strong. The rebel cavalry have not, until recently, effected much harm to our rear. The burning of the bridge at Tilton and the destruction of the trains there, and WHARTON's dash last week, have been the only damage since the burning of the mule train at Cassville. Gen.

HOVER, on Goerck-street. Mr. DANIELS served during the Revolutionary war under the immediate command of Gen. WASHINGTON, and was conspicuous for his bravery in the battles of Monmouth, Trenton and White Plains. He was one of the first who entered the City of New-York after its evacuation by the British, and assisted in hauling down the enemy's flag and planting the Stars and Stripes in its place. Mr. DANIELS also served through the war of 1812. He was born in Westchester County, this State, in 1754; was by occupation a farmer, but had resided in this City for the last sixty years. He was married young, and was the father of nine children, seven of whom are now living. He led a temperate life, retained all his faculties up to within a short time of his death, and died of old age. The funeral of the old soldier took place yesterday afternoon, from the house in which he died, and was largely attended. The following veterans of the war of 1812, acted as pall-bearers: Gen. H. Raymond, Col. Abraham Dally, Col. William Buttery, Lieut.-Col. Wm. Corbire, Capt. J.B. Fox, Capt. Henry Baker, Aid-de-Camp Thomas L. Watson, and Chaplain Joseph Hall.

The Imperial School of Mines at Paris, is familiar to Americans, many of our youth having frequented the lectures given there, although not more than two or three have ever taken diplomas, and the title of Engineer of Mines, from that school. The most celebrated in Germany, are the well-known ones of Freiburg, in Saxony, and Clausthal, in the Hartz. Hungary has a seat of instruction at Schemnitz. England established a Mining School in 1851, in connection with the National Museum of Geology. It was a necessity for the development of her East India possessions. This instituted a new calling and career for a large class of her gentry, who entered upon it with ardor. A School of Mines seems to be useful to all capitalists, who, when urged to invest in mining operations, are dependent upon the reports of interested parties.

We do not ascribe it to any anticipation of difficulty in carrying the financial department of the Government through the crisis which circumstances seem to have created for it, because Mr. CHASE is not the man to shrink from any duty or responsibility in which the honor and welfare of the nation are involved. The more threatening the aspect of affaire in his department, the more likely would he have been, other things being equal, to stand by the helm and do everything in his power to avert impending dangers. He has become involved, it is true, in a very embarrassing controversy with the State banks throughout the country, and has committed himself, perhaps too unreservedly, to certain theories of finance in connection with the war; and he may have thought that some other person could more gracefully introduce changes of policy, which experience has shown to be indispensable, than he could himself.

We publish sufficient of its text this morning, principally to show how susceptible of grateful feeling toward the British community, Capt. SEMMES really is. It is a singular return, this same letter, for the facilities first of all accorded to SEMMES and his masters in British ports, for making their first start as privateers. He charges the British Government not only with issuing orders of neutrality which bear unequally upon the rebel cause, but with having forced Spain and France, as well as the smaller commercial Powers, to similar orders. He derides the English people on their boasted fair play, and sneers at what he calls their ""pious horror"" of seeing innocent merchantmen burnt at sea. Nothing, he thinks, would have been easier or more natural than to have had his prizes brought into any convenient neutral port, quietly to lie there until they should be adjudicated on; and this simple arrangement, while bringing him profit where he has had none, would have saved much property from needless destruction.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Semmes to his Patrons.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Semmes to his Patrons.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/88a42eea-cf57-5b3d-8c10-d0ec4de100f1,485,nyt://article/88a42eea-cf57-5b3d-8c10-d0ec4de100f1,

WHITE, in Henry County, Tenn., and demanded $10,000 booty as a ransom for his life. As so much could not be found by them after a thorough search, they seized Mr. WHITE and dragged him from his bed, carried him a short distance from the house and shot him dead, three bullets entering his body. What conversation passed between these fiendish assassins and their victim is unknown, as Mrs. WHITE, his wife, who [???]ed after them, was driven back upon peril [???] [???]ing the late of her husband. Mr. [???] was a planter, and had resided in [???] a few years. He was raising [???] one hundred acres of cotton. He was born in this State, was the son of JOHN WHITE, and was about 42 years of age. He resided several years in Johnston, and was educated in the manufacturing business at Simmonsville, under the guidance of BENJAMIN PIRCE, Esq. After becoming prepared for the management of a mill, he and his family removed to Bahia, Brazil, where he was engaged in cotton spinning for about two years, when he returned to his native State and took charge of the Simmonsville mills for a short time. Thence he removed to Barnesville, Ohio, where he built a mill and engaged in the manufacture of wick, twine, yarn, batts, bags and wadding. The business was very successful, and his mill was the only one of the kind in the vicinity, and the articles were readily taken for home consumption.

The rebels of our day have claimed that the mantle of our fathers has fallen upon them, but we, for our part, see not a vestige about them of our fathers' garments. Respect for the opinions of mankind could not be a very prominent feature among those who, in their very outset, trampled upon principles which civilization and Christianity have prized most highly, and who have never hesitated to declare that if the ""opinions of mankind"" did not sustain them in their love of Slavery, it was so much the worse for mankind. But they have recently put on a little show of respect for those opinions, for the rebel Congress has issued a manifesto, which we find in the Richmond Whig, the purpose of which is declared, in the preamble to the resolution by which it was adopted, to be ""to enlighten the public opinion of the world with regard to the true character of the struggle in which they are engaged, and the dispositions, principles and purposes by which they are actuated.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Manifesto and the Declaration of Independence.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Manifesto and the Declaration of Independence.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'POETRY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/82996db2-9c10-5bf4-8d59-4dcdf82421a0,1846,nyt://article/82996db2-9c10-5bf4-8d59-4dcdf82421a0,

A motion was introduced on that evening by a private member, Sir JOHN HAY, on which it was found possible not only to rally the regular Conservative vote of the House, but various discontented members of the Ministerial party as well. Involving nothing in the shape of party political principle, the vote was precisely one on which malcontents of every degree might give vent to their personal grievances. It purported to censure the Government for a grave executive delinquency in landing forces on the African Gold Coast for the purpose of waging war against the King of Ashantee, without making sufficient provision for preserving the health of the troops. The case thus briefly stated was clearly proven. The utmost negligence was brought home to the War Department, and Lord PALMERSTON had to apply the ""whip"" to his following with no ordinary vigor to prevent the passage of what would have been equivalent to a vote of non-confidence. The best he could do was to come off with a majority of seven in a House of four hundred and fifty members -- a condition of party weakness, which but for two contingent events would be alarming. The first of these events is an early dissolution of the House. The next is the evident commitment of the Government to a war policy as the alternative of a rejection by Germany of the proposal to make the Schlei the territorial dividing line between her and Denmark.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Palmerston and the House of Commons.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Palmerston and the House of Commons.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96190b96-7750-529d-b4ba-04f402f44563,710,nyt://article/96190b96-7750-529d-b4ba-04f402f44563,

"Intervention, London Post and Herald on; Warning to South in 1860",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/03/archives/english-intervention.html,"Intervention, London Post and Herald on; Warning to South in 1860","The English Tories have again begun to talk very glibly of intervention on behalf of the South. The Morning Post, which, though it has always been an advocate of the Confederacy, speaks with far more weight and authority than the regular organ of the Davis Government, the Morning Herald, says that ""there can be no doubt that the feeling in favor of intervention is growing apace. The only evidence it offers in support of this assertion is that Lord ENFIELD has presented a petition from a number of people in London -- or as it expresses it, ""from the inhabitants of the Metropolis,"" in this sense; and that Lord BROUGHAM ""has refused during the last three weeks to present similar petitions from various mercantile bodies, because he felt that the time to interfere has not yet arrived."" This is not very strong proof, it must be admitted, that the feeling in favor of intervention is growing, for there is no doubt that any number of petitions of a similar character might have been got up, both amongst ""the inhabitants of the Metropolis"" and amongst ""mercantile bodies"" any day since the war begun. Moreover, the ground on which intervention is now urged is the very same on which it was urged two years ago, and is just as absurd now as it was shown to be then. It is neither more nor less than the greatness of the carnage by which the struggle is marked. It appears that the English Tories have established a maximum of slaughter which two foreign belligerents may be allowed to commit; but if they go beyond this, England is to interpose and force peace upon them by committing a little more slaughter herself. What this maximum is, they do not deign to mention. How many even England can conscientiously permit a foreign Power to kill or lose in action, has not yet been revealed; nor are we informed at what precise point in the progress of hostilities English humanity becomes so outraged, that the British Government has to fight itself to quiet the public nerves.

"The Paris correspondent of the Star, writing from Paris on June 10, says: ""LA POMMERAIS was this morning executed at 6 o'clock, in front of La Roquette. Yesterday at 5 P.M. orders were given to carry it out, the Procureur-General having a few hours earlier announced the Emperor's decision not to alter the judgment of the Assize Court of the Seine. This was not told the unhappy convict before 5 o'clock this morning. The Governor of La Roquette then entered his cell, and briefly conveyed to him the Emperor's refusal to interfere with the decision of the law officers. LA POMMERAIS was awake when the door opened, and, on hearing his fate, merely replied, 'I am ready to meet it.' The chaplain next made his appearance. He threw himself on the prisoner's neck, and embraced him several times. A private conversation, or rather a kind of confession, ensued, which lasted for some minutes. It is not, however, confidently supposed that this proceeded from any change of faith, but rather from an impulse to speak confidentially to another human being; for the evening before, LA POMMERAIS, on being asked by the governor of the prison if he required the consolations of the Church he replied. 'Buh! religion is good for nine out children.' The conversation with the chaplain over, Mr. CLAUDE, the Director of the Police of Public Safety came forward and demanded if the convict had any revelation to make, to which an answer in the negative was given. La POMMERAIS was then handed over the executioner's assistants, who brought him into the 'robing-room.' His hands and feet were then pinioned and his hair cut. He submitted with apparent resignation to this operation. Before it was finished the Chaplain asked to cut off one lock for Mme. LA POMMERAIS. This request was granted, and before the relic was folded away, LA POMMERAIS kissed it, asking as he did so, that it should be forthwith given to his wife, from whom the priest in attendance read a most tender letter. At five minutes to six the prison doors were opened, and the condemned man was directed to proceed to the scaffold. He advanced with a firm step. His face was of a death-like pallor, and, owing to the chill air of the morning, and the light clothing which he wore, he shivered as he advanced toward the scaffold. The language of those non-official persons who assembled to witness this expiation of a greet crime was brutal to the last degree. They hissed and hooted as the convict was about to mount the ladder, and were loudest in their brutal demonstrations when the crucifix was pressed to his lips. The blade had scarcely severed his head from his body, when a rush was made to do violence to the trunk. The troops were obliged to interfere, and had some difficulty in repeling the crowd, which was excited by the sight of a 'gentleman criminal' to a pitch of savage ferocity. When all was over, the chaplain turned round, and in a loud voice, said: 'I am, I am glad to say, consoled by what has passed between us.' The Pays, in noticing this expiation of a great crime, states that the crowd retired in silence. But I am in a position to affirm that the contrary was the case. The Presse and some other journals bear out the information I have this morning received from a private source.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/03/archives/execution-of-la-pommerais-the-foreign-troops-in-mexico.html,,"The Paris correspondent of the Star, writing from Paris on June 10, says: ""LA POMMERAIS was this morning executed at 6 o'clock, in front of La Roquette.

When Gen. WILSON arrived at Reams' Station, on the Weldon Railroad, he found the whole rebel cavalry force under LEE and HAMPTON, concentrated to cut off his retreat. This force he fought with great gallantry, and repulsed all their charges and attempts to cut him to pieces. The next morning, however, before daylight, he was impetuously attacked by a large force of rebel infantry, which had reached the spot during the night. A retreat was now ordered, but the rebels having destroyed the bridges over Stony Creek, all hope of saving the artillery and trains was given up, the guns were spiked and abandoned and the wagons and ambulances were destroyed. All the wounded, too seriously injured to ride horses, fell into the hands of the enemy. Gen. KAUTZ and a large portion of his command succeeded in escaping, but up to Thursday night Gen. WILSON had not reported. On Tuesday Gen. WILSON sent for infantry support, and the Sixth Corps was sent to his relief.

BROCKHURST kept the pistol for some time, but kept it locked up, and subsequently delivered it to a man named TURNER, who came for it in company with BRADY.

THOMAS recently sent out a fatigue party to the field of Chickamauga to inter, or rather reinter, the Union dead who fell in the fight last Fall. Most of them had been, buried by our troops after the battle of Missionary Ridge, but very lightly, and apportions of the bodies were, in a majority of cases, found protruding above the ground. The detail was accompanied by Mr. READ, the agent of the Sanitary Commission, who occupied himself in taking such notes of the bodies as might aid their friends in discovering their graves, or procuring their transmission to their homes if desired. He has recently sent in a report of his labors to Dr. NEWBERRY, the Secretary of the Commission in the West, and in it he states that they only in one instance discovered indications that any of our dead had been buried by the rebels, and in this the bodies were all found shot through the head, and their legs or arms tied or strapped together, affording all but conclusive proof that they had been massacred after capture and surrender. Incidents of this kind have frequently been reported before, but never, so far as we remember, in so authentic a shape as this. We mention this now, not for the purpose of urging upon the Government the propriety and duty of retaliation, but of placing on record, once more, an illustration of the character of the enemy with which we have to deal. The Administration has long had in its possession satisfactory evidence of the commission of the grossest atrocities by the rebels, and it has repeatedly threatened retaliation, but, so far, has never inflicted it. We have always thought, and think still, that some effort ought to have been made to inflict punishment at least on the guilty or presumably guilty parties. We think that, for instance, every prisoner taken from the gang which assaulted Fort Pillow ought to have had short shrift, and that it is neither just nor expedient nor humane to ask the negro troops and their white officers to incur greater risks than fall to the lot of the white soldiers, as long as we have it in our power to protect them from them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebels and their Deeds.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebels and their Deeds.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f78c4a51-ec18-5e00-8b12-89ebfa8a4c59,725,nyt://article/f78c4a51-ec18-5e00-8b12-89ebfa8a4c59,

After to-day there will be a general and judicious thinning out of theatres and shows. The Winter Garden, as our readers are aware, has already passed into the hands of the purifiers, and will remain closed until important changes have been effected in its internal arrangements and decorations. Mrs. WOOD's regular season came to a close on Saturday. It has been conducted with spirit and has ended prosperously. The company was not very good at the commencement, and had indeed to be reinforced for almost every new piece, but the conspicuous ability of Mrs. JOHN WOOD made all things bearable. For the present the house passes into the hands of an English opera company, composed of a portion of Mr. L.F. HARRISON's Philadelphia troupe. The opening opera is ""Maritana,"" and although not in the managerial confidence, we think we may safely announce that the ""Bohemian Girl"" will speedily be produced.

"There is as yet no satisfactory reason given for the collision between the Matanzas and the Locust Point, which resulted in the sinking of the latter vessel and the loss of seventeen lives. The only blame attached to any person is to the mate, ROBY, who was lost. It was his watch, and the course of the vessel was directed by him. Capt. HOFFMAN at the [???] of the accident, was in his cabin conversing with a friend, to whom he remarked, as he was about retiring for the night, that he would step out on deck and see if everything was all right. The collision occurred while he was in the act of opening his door. The captain immediately ordered the small boats to be cut loose from their lashings, and, although he could have easily entered one of them, he refused to leave his sinking craft, and went down with her. As he could not swim, his life was saved by accidentally catching a trunk as he rose to the surface of the water. But the hero of the sad scene was the second mate, Mr. JACOB GUNSTONE, who, with the only boat afloat of the Locust Point, remained in the vicinity of the disaster until six o'clock in the morning, regardless of the fact that the Mantanzas was rapidly drifting from him. When seen in the morning he was nearly five miles distant from that vessel still endeavoring to rescue those who were yet clinging to pieces of the wreck.

The English are beginning to see that in event of such a war two or three privateers would sweep her commerce from the seas, as two or three privateers, built by her subjects and in her ports, have nearly swept the American flag from the seas. Now, this would produce an immense development of French commerce; and it is well known that the extension and enlargement of the commerce of France has been for the last ten years the principal aim of the present Emperor, in his colonial and foreign policy, in his foreign wars and aggressions, such as those in Cochin-China, in the islands of the Pacific, and on this continent. To this end he has made and is making the most gigantic efforts, and is expending vast sums of money.

He has brilliant talents, a quick, keen and just judgment, fixed fidelity of principle and of purpose and untiring industry in the performance of public duties. As Speaker, he has won universal approbation and increased his already general and decided popularity.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/07/archives/from-europe.html,,"By arrival of the steamship Asia at Halifax yesterday, we have dates from Liverpool to June 25, and Queenstown 26th. The officers and crew of the Alabama captured by the Kearsarge were liberated on parole at Cherbourg. Capt. SEMMES has announced that he will embark on a new Alabama on the 15th of August next. It is generally believed that his next vessel will be the ex-British man-of-war Rappahannock. In London a committee has been fhrmed to present Capt. SEMMES with a handsome sword. The yacht Deerhound, which rescued Capt. SEMMES, is now thought to have been a tender to the Alabama. Capt. WINSLOW, of the Kearsarge, says the reason why he did not pursue the Deerhound was, that he did not believe any one carrying the flag of the Royal Yacht Squadron could act so dishonorably. The superiority of the Kearsarge seems to have attracted the attention of the English Parliament. In the House of Commons Lord HAY called the attention of the Government to the action and asked whether they would continue building vessels which could neither fight nor swing. The Admiralty are said to be anxious to examine the methoA which was used to strengthen the sides of the Kearsarge. The first English iron-clad is said to be a success. The Dano-German Conference held its last sitting on the 25th ult. It has succeeded in doing nothing, and hostilities will probably be immediately resumed. The documents relating to the Conference were to have been presented to Parliament on the 27th inst., the day after the Asia left. This German Powers, it is asserted, are still prepared to treat upon a line to demarkation, and to conclude an armistice for two months. Should Denmark accept these terms peace may yet be preserved. The new steamer Yeddo, believed to have been built for the rebels, at Bordeaux, is said to have left that port for Amsterdam.

It has been demonstrated by the desperate tenacity with which LEE holds his ground. If it was not of vital importance to him to be where he is, he would be elsewhere. If he thought the Confederacy could be saved by invading the North, he would now be on the Potomac, not with a single division, but with his whole army. Of this we may be sure.

This is the third Summer that they have been terribly frightened by an advance of the Confederates up the Shenandoah Valley, and it has been well known, ever since GRANT's campaign opened, that it was perfectly feasible for the rebels to make a dash into Maryland with a small foree, if they chose to do so. There is no way of guaranteeing that no body of them, great or small, shall under any circumstances cross the Potomac. There is, therefore, a touch of the comical -- to use a mild term -- in this calling out of the militia every year, after the enemy has actually crossed the border, and when he is threatening the State Capital, and when about thirty-six or twenty-four hours remain for recruiting, arming, equipping and drilling them -- a short space, it will be admitted, for the organization of a force which is expected to stand in the open field against such troops as EARLY's or EWELL's. What makes the matter worse, is that the volunteers are called out just at the moment when they themselves, as well as their friends and neighbors, are terribly scared, and busily engaged in removing their horses and other valuables, and when the air is thick with wild rumors of the enemy's strength and ferocity. They consequently ""fly to arms,"" with imaginations in a splendid state of excitability, to march under officers whom they have perhaps never seen, and in whom it is quite safe to say they place no confidence, and meet the foe, as he advances, without drill, discipline or organization.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Raiders in the North The Policy for Pennsylvania.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Raiders in the North The Policy for Pennsylvania.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10359e51-874c-5e12-a065-33d5855fd99d,548,nyt://article/10359e51-874c-5e12-a065-33d5855fd99d,

MORRIS died at his residence at 1 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, the 6th inst., aged 62 years. Mr. MORRIS was born at Philadelphia on the 10th of October, 1802. At an early age he removed to New-York, where, when in his fifteenth year, he commenced his literary career by writing verses for the New-York Gazette. In August, 1823, in conjunction with SAMUEL WOODWORTH, he commenced the publication of the New-York Mirror, a journal which employed some of the best literary talent of the country, and was one of the most prominent periodicals of its class, until Dec. 31, 1842, when it was discontinued under the financial disasters of the times. In 1843, he associated himself with Mr. WILLIS in the publication of the New-York Mirror. In 1844 he established a daily paper called the Evening Mirror. At the close of 1845 he commenced alone a weekly journal called the National Press, the title of which he changed in 1846 to that of the Home Journal, and from that time until his death he and Mr. WILLIS conducted it. Though well known as a journalist, he was much more widely known as a song-writer, and as such was one of the most popular of his day. Millions of copies of his ""Woodman Spare that Tree"" are said to have been circulated, and, with others, as ""We Were Boys Together,"" ""Land, Ho!"" ""Long Time Ago,"" ""The Origin of Yankee Doodle,"" ""My Mother's Bible,"" &c., proved sources of great profit to their publishers. The Melodies for many of his songs were written by BALFE, Sir JOHN STEPHENSON and other distinguished English composers, and have been sung in public by MALIBRAN, RUSSELL, Madame ANNA BISHOP and many other celebrated vocalists. Various editions of his poems have been published, including one in 1840 with illustrations by WEIR and CHAPMAN. In 1853 he published a volume entitled ""The Deserted Bride and other Poems,"" and he afterwards edited a volume of ""American melodies."" In 1837 he produced a successful drama, entitled ""Brier Cliff,"" founded on incidents in the American Revolution. In 1842, he wrote the libretto of the opera of ""The Maid of Saxony."" He has also published a volume of prose sketches, entitled The Little Frenchman and his Water Lots. Mr. MORRIS was for some time a Brigadier-General in the New-York State Militia. For many years he resided at Undercliff, a country seat on the Hudson, nearly opposite West Point.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'GEN.

The Invasion of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/08/archives/the-maryland-raid.html,The Invasion of,"We publish this morning a variety of reports, by telegraph and by mail, purporting to supply some details of the progress of the rebel raid on the Upper Potomac. The most direct and apparently authentic of these reports represents the rebels in considerable force near Frederick City. Five miles from that place an engagement or skirmish took place yesterday, and late reports represent the rebels as being within one mile of the town where Gen. WALLACE is said to have checked their progress -- the sick and the Government stores, meanwhile, having been removed to avoid capture. Apart from this report, however, the stories received by telegraph are sufficiently conflicting to bewilder any one seeking intelligible information. The only way in which we could expect to be furnished with trustworthy detailed intelligence is, for the moment, closed against us. The telegraph wires are either cut or in possession of the rebels both east and west of Maryland Heights, where Gen. SIGEL has posted himself; and the opportunity that officer has of watching the enemy's movements is practically lost, so far as enabling the military authorities or the general public to judge of the real nature of the emergency. We assume, however, from all that is yet reported, that Gen. SIGEL holds Maryland Heights without difficulty, and that, even if HUNTER is not already close upon the rear of the rebel raiders, there is no danger of any disaster to the force under SIGEL's command. The position is one of no common natural strength, and it would not be worth while for EWELL or EARLY, or whoever commands the rebel army, to waste time and strength in assailing it. From the accounts before us we can form, as yet, only a vague conjecture as to the numerical strength of the invading army. The more sober statements place it at 7,000 cavalry and infantry. The sensational reports fix it at from 30,000 to 40,000. The readiest way to bring these figures to a common-sense test is to ask, what the rebels -- be they many or few -- have been about since Saturday last? All the accounts agree that they have been plundering indiscriminately at every point they have touched; that they have shown almost a total disregard of everything like regular army discipline, such as even marked their former raids; and, beyond all, that they have been seen driving large herds of horses and cattle across the river above and around Hagerstown, toward the entrance to the Shenandoah Valley. All this certainly goes to prove anything but the presence of a large and thoroughly organized corps of regulars. Or at least it would seem to prove anything but a deliberate scheme of invasion, having any higher object than the recruitment of a used-up cavalry division or two, and the procurement of food and clothing for a few thousand of the starving ragamuffins who were sent in pursuit of HUNTER. At Washington, reports of the rapid advance of HUNTER toward the rebel rear appear to be fully credited. On what foundation these reports rest we find it utterly impossible to divine. They may be thoroughly trustworthy; but we are not disposed to be sanguine about it. The chances seem at the moment not unfavorable for EARLY'S escape whenever he pleases to go, with a very considerable amount of plunder, as it is open to him, we should judge, to take whichever side of the Blue Ridge may seem most advantageous in his retreat.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Maryland Raid.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Maryland Raid.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7a4bf393-085b-5be3-8384-2325fd8f1bcb,581,nyt://article/7a4bf393-085b-5be3-8384-2325fd8f1bcb,

We publish ample details of the different views and speculations to which the fight has given birth on the other side of the Atlantic. By telegraph from Port au Basque, in the St. Lawrence, we have European news brought by the Nova Scotian, which left Liverpool on the 28th, two days later than the Asia. By way of Cape Race, the Peruvian brings news two days still later than the Nova Scotian. Both vessels belong to the Montreal line; the first-named having taken the place of the disabled steamer, (reported by the Asia.) The news is meagre, and as relates to the vexed Dano-German question, altogether misty and unsatisfactory. It seems, judging from the tone of the London Times, that the British Government are backing down from their supposed determination to stand by Denmark. The Tories, taking advantage of this indecision, have resolved on bringing on a question of non-confidence in Parliament; but, as we gather from the Peruvian's skeleton report, they are not likely to command a majority -- so that Ministers are probably safe for the time. A Paris paper gives a report that two rebel cruisers are off Cherbourg watching for the Kearsarge.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32610feb-c970-53bd-9b48-5ab29a6faec0,221,nyt://article/32610feb-c970-53bd-9b48-5ab29a6faec0,

New-York; Woman Killed by Machinery,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/09/archives/general-city-news.html,New-York; Woman Killed by Machinery,"FRIGHTFUL ACCIDENT -- A WOMAN KILLED BY MACHINERY. -- A woman, aged about 30 years, whose name was unknown, yesterday called on Mr. D.G. McCUTTER, of No. 110 Liberty-street, for the purpose of obtaining employment as a domestic. She had been recommended by the Superintendent of the Flatbush Railroad to Mr. MCCUTTER, and the latter engaged her on condition that his wife was satisfied, and the woman left for the avowed purpose of calling upon the wife. It appears, however, that she proceeded to the rear basement of premises No. 112 Liberty, (next door,) descended a dark stairway, and while groping her way her clothes caught on an upright shaft which was at the time revolving at the rate of about fifty revolutions per minute. This shaft was a part of the machinery of Messrs. ALLEN & TAYLOR's saleratus manufactory. The terrible shrieks of the unfortunate woman speedily brought the engineer to the spot, and as soon as possible the engine was stopped. Life, however, was extinct, and the body and limbs were most shockingly mangled. From the investigation made by Coroner RANNEY, it would seem that her hoop-skirt was caught on the shaft, and in that situation she was whirled round and round for the space of two or three minutes. Seven or eight steel hoops of her skirt were found twisted into a rope and wound, by the force of the machinery, so tightly around her lower limbs, that one of them was cut off and the other nearly so. Deceased has left one child which is at a charitable institution in Flatbush. Her husband died several months since.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96928504-342b-5c8d-8f40-06a400d9a1c8,732,nyt://article/96928504-342b-5c8d-8f40-06a400d9a1c8,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/10/archives/general-city-news.html,,"REARREST OF A NOTED THIEF. -- CHARLES PATTERSON, who for a long time past has been known as a desperate thief in that part of the Seventeenth Ward known as ""Mackerelville,"" was rearrested on Friday night, last on a bench-warrant, issued by the Court of General Sessions. The arrest was made by Sergeant McGIVENS of the Seventeenth Precinct, on the charge is highway robbery. PATTERSON with an accomplice was first taken into custody on the 28th of December last for robbing Mr. MARTIN BALLARD of One Hundred and Twenty-ninth-street, at the corner of Third-avenue and Eighth-street, and was indicted by the Grand Jury. BURNS, his accomplice, was convicted and sent to Sing-Sing. PATTERSON was admitted bail, which he forfeited, but was rearrested. While awaiting trial he was claimed as a deserter by the military authorities and given up so them. He was sent to the Park Barracks, but made his escape after he had been confined there three days. Since then he has been at large, but kept out of the way of the Seventeenth Precinct police, who had the warrant for him. Friday afternoon, Sergeant MCGIVEN saw him walking along Fourth-avenue, and hailed him. PATTERSON immediately started to run, followed by the Sergeant in close pursuit. After an exciting chase, MCGAVEN was gaining on the fugitive so rapidly that PATTERSON ran into an oyster saloon at the corner of Broadway and Twelfth-street, and sat down at a table as unconcerned as possible, and called for refreshments. Here the Sergeant followed and arrested him. MCGIVEN deserves much credit for his prompt and daring action on this occasion, as the desperate character of PATTERSON was well-known to him. Fortunately for the officer his prisoner was unarmed, which is contrary to his usual custom. Capt. BROWN and Sergt. MCGIVEN, conveyed the prisoner before Mr. HALL, the District Attorney, who committed him to the Tombs to stand trial at the Sessions.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3039ac2d-5a04-5a96-a5a8-c5ac7e089678,657,nyt://article/3039ac2d-5a04-5a96-a5a8-c5ac7e089678,

Here was a sloop manned by a picked crew of as brave hearts as ever were borne upon the ocean, conquered by a vessel of similar size, and sunk with comparative impunity. The armament of the Kearsarge consisted of 2 11 inch Dahlgren guns and 6 32-pounders, with a small rifled piece for a chase gun, &c. That of the Alabama of the same number of 32-pounders, a ri[???]ed 100-pounder, and a solid 8 inch shot gun (68-pounder.) It seems to us that Capt. SEMMES had too high an opinion of his so-called 100-pounder, because it was a rifled gun -- ignorant probably that it was the size of bore and largeness of the powder charge which constituted the power of the gun. Measured by this standard, the rifled pivot 100-pounder was not half as effective as his 8-inch solid-shot pivot-gun, which in its turn, was not half so powerful as either of the Kearsarge's two 11-inch pivot-guns, and probably not one-third as effective when fired against a wooden ship entirely unprotected by armor. The 32 pounders on each side were about equal, and of comparatively small account as to influencing the fate of the action, which was evidently decided by the pivot-guns. In addition to his vessel's carrying a much more powerful armament, the Captain of the Kearsarge had taken the wise precaution to make use of temporary armor, consisting of chain cables fastened along her sides to some distance before and abaft the engines and boilers, which were thus so effectually protected that the Alabama's shell broke up against it and fell back harmlessly into the sea; her round shot, being of cast-iron, fared no better; and, beyond stripping off a little of the thin wooden sheathing which covered over the cable of the Kearsarge, this vessel appears to have received no damage.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.; A PROFESSIONAL VIEW.

Dano-German Crisis; The,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/10/archives/the-european-crisis.html,Dano-German Crisis; The,"The failure and dissolution of the London Conference, leaves the Danes and Germans at liberty to renew the conflict whenever they please; but whether it will expand into a great European war, depends on the action of England. The ministerial statement relative to the course which the British Government means to pursue, was waited for with intense anxiety. The nation at large is clamorous for war. The Times, however, thinks that, as the proposition of the neutral Powers was rejected by both belligerents, England is not bound to interfere as long as the struggle is confined to Schleswig, and such may be the opinion of the Cabinet, which is evidently most reluctant to embark in the conflict, and would gladly avoid doing so. Nor is this to be wondered at. From the days of MARLBOROUGH, the German States have been the steady allies of England in her wars against France. At Blenheim, at Ramillies, at Waterloo, Teutons and Britons were fellow-soldiers and fellow-conquerors, and the laurels gathered on those fields belong in common to the two peoples. It is not improbable, therefore, that the remembrance of these things influences British statesmen not a little, and makes them pause ere appealing to the arbitrament of the sword. England can easily rush into the war -- can easily find powerful supporters among the disaffected subjects of Prussia and Austria -- but would the reannexation of Venetia to Italy, or the reestablishment of the Hungarian kingdom, or the reconstruction and resuscitation of Poland, compensate England for the partial dismemberment of the great German Powers, and their reduction to the condition of second-rate States?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The European Crisis.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The European Crisis.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7dd27d15-dfd0-571d-b3a2-398ce90ce48c,454,nyt://article/7dd27d15-dfd0-571d-b3a2-398ce90ce48c,

Something will undoubtedly be learned in that line, but one thing which our naval officers will certainly not forget, is never again to trust the honor of a British sailor present as a spectator. Some of that class might and probably would be honorable men, but the safest way will be never to trust them. Capt. WINSLOW, when he found the Deerhound making off with his prisoners, ought to have ordered her back by a shot across her bows, and if that had not proved effectual he should have given her another amidships.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/11/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"We publish this morning some thirty telegraph ic dispatches, relating, more or less directly, to the rebel raid in Maryland and Southwestern Pennsylvania. The most alarming of these telegrams will be found to be that which we repro duce from yesterday's issue, and which takes the form of an official dispatch from the War Department, at Washington. It is founded, as most of our city readers doubtless learned yesterday on Gen. WALLACE's report of a rather obstinate fight which took place on Saturday at Monocacy Bridge, between a considerable rebel force, supposed to be BRECKENRIDGE's division, and a small body of our troops that had been sent to occupy Frederick City. The fight, it will be seen (and it is the only fight this raid has produced thus far), lasted probably about eight hours or so. We lost a thousand men in round figures, and Gen. WALLACE found himself compelled to retreat, leaving his dead and wounded, or most of them, we regret to say, behind him. A part from this fair, stand-up fight the reports we have of the rebel movements continue to be a mere mixture of bald and meagre statements from eye-witnesses at fifty different points, and a batch of conjectures as absurd, as it is possible to conceive. The rebel infantry can only be to-day a few miles farther down the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, than they were on Saturday at the close of the fight. They may possibly have got within forty-eight or fifty miles of Baltimore, if they are traveling in that direction. The rebel cavalry are here, there, and everywhere. A portion, under MOSBY, is in Fairfax County, south of the Potomac, and around Edward's Ferry. A portion was seen yesterday by a mail-carrier, at the village of Rockville, about fourteen miles from Washington. Another squad was reported yesterday at Ellicott's Mills, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; but this is probably untrue, since we find Gen. WALLACE dating a dispatch from that place yesterday, to Secretary SEWARD, announcing the safety (contrary to the previous official report) of Col. SEWARD. Still another portion of the rebel cavalry have crossed the Northern Central Railroad at Cockeysville, burning a bridge and doing promiscuous damage at that point. Doubtless there are many other points along the railroad lines where the rebel cavalry have already shown themselves; without waiting to fight or even to carry off plunder. From the flying movements they execute, it is impossible to reckon their numbers. There comes a rumor -- very absurd in character -- that LEE himself is in command. Respecting the movements of our own forces we can speak positively, if we speak briefly. Even if a portion of HUNTER's force has not yet reached Martinsburgh, as is reported, Gen. COUCH is in strong force at Hagerstown. Gen. WALLACE has been reinforced so as to make a sudden advance on Baltimore by any large body of infantry impossible; and more important than all, a body of veterans of the national army is now at a point within easy reach either of Washington or Baltimore, in case of further signs of trouble. The latest dispatch from Baltimore represents everything quiet in that city, and the train running through from Washington with no interruption whatever. To all this it may be added, that Gen. GRANT is in no way moved from his propriety by the so-called invasion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/211b9854-1e3c-5dec-a971-386f53781c18,647,nyt://article/211b9854-1e3c-5dec-a971-386f53781c18,

Invasion of; the Meaning of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/11/archives/the-rebel-invasion.html,Invasion of; the Meaning of,"What is the real magnitude and meaning of this new rebel invasion of Maryland? -- Just a week ago to-day the news of an advance movement of a large rebel force up the Shenandoah Valley astonished the incredulous country. The thing seemed so much out of keeping with the position of affairs elsewhere, that few people paid any serious attention to it. It was generally ridiculed as preposterous in itself, and the excitement along the border was thought to be but a great popular scare, produced by the sudden apparition of a few hundred Confederate cavalrymen. Even after the retreat of SIGEL from Martinsburgh to the north side of the Potomac, the appearance of the rebels in Hagerstown and Frederick, and down through all the rebel movements to the close of last week, the whole matter was treated by the people as a great fright rather than a great fact. The very excited, absurdly exaggerated, and entirely contradictory character of the telegraphic dispatches that followed each other in quick succession from Maryland and Pennsylvania, was in great part the cause of this want of faith and of serious feeling. It was only yesterday, on the publication of Secretary STANTON's official bulletin, that people could be induced to do anything but laugh at the ""great rebel invasion."" The effect of that bulletin was very sudden, and induced those who had previously been most hilarious over the affair to be most lugubrious over the new aspect of it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Invasion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Invasion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89ea0385-13c4-5a8f-9f60-d23265b8286b,1049,nyt://article/89ea0385-13c4-5a8f-9f60-d23265b8286b,

Had it, indeed, been true that there was a serious variance between the executive and legislative branches of the Government on this subject, it would have been very unfortunate. To hasten a general reconciliation, it is important that the reclaimed States should be relieved of military rule, and returned to their old positions in the Union, just as soon as they can be trusted. But neither the President nor Congress singly can do the work necessary to such restoration. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, has the power to appoint and maintain Military Governors, during the war, as long as in his judgment the military situation requires it. Congress, under the clause of the Constitution which gives the two bodies the exclusive right to determine the qualifications of their members, has the sole power to decide when the States shall be reinstated in the national councils. To make the restoration a substantial thing, there must be conjoint action between the President and Congress.

He does not deny any of the facts of the case, viz.: that Capt. WINSLOW requested him to do what he could to save the Alabama's crew, and that he having picked up SEMMES and the rest, set off with all speed for the shores of England. But he says, ""I was not aware then, and I am not aware now, that the men whom I saved were, or ever had been, Capt. WINSLOW's prisoners."" If he had only said that he was not aware then that such was the fact, we should have understood him as saying that he did not know that SEMMES had surrendered, which would not have been entirely improbable. But when he says that he is not aware of it, as he writes, he shows that he means that he is not aware that a man who has surrendered is a prisoner. He will hardly make people believe he is so ignorant as that. The man may escape afterward, but he is none the less a prisoner when he surrenders. And SEMMES was a prisoner as soon as he hauled down his flag. He undoubtedly had the right to try to escape; but so have all the rebels whom we hold here in safe keeping.

She was heavily laden with merchandise of various kinds, having just arrived at her dock, and owing to the highly inflamable nature of some of the articles on board, the flames spread with great rapidity through the vessel. In about half an hour from the time the alarm was given, the steamer and contents were wrapt in a sheet of fire. Soon the flames extended to the Pier (No. 1) against which the John Potter was lying. This pier was 600 feet in length, and was inclosed and roofed over from one end to the other with wood. A large amount of valuable property, consigned to various parties, and consisting of cotton, hemp, tobacco, hardware, and divers kinds of dry goods, was stored thereon. When the fiery element made its grasp on these articles of merchandise, the scene throughout all the lower part of the City became grand and sublime. The burning steamer and contents, the long dock with its wooden roof and sides, and the vast piles of highly combustible merchandise, with which it was crowded, all encircled in a sheet of flames. To add to the grandeur of the occasion, a heavy shower of rain came on just at this time. Amid the storm of rain, thunder and lightning, the fire-bells throughout the City pealed forth their solemn tones, fire-engines rattled down Broadway and along the side streets, and the firemen (those ever watchful guardians of the City) hurried rapidly on their way to the place of the conflagration.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Extensive Fire at Pier No. 1 North River.

As a Naval Fighter,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/12/archives/semmes-as-a-naval-fighter.html,As a Naval Fighter,"Firing at long range is the peculiar office of a rifle gun. ""A quarter of a mile,"" even three-quarters of a mile, cannot be called long range. Why Capt. SEMMES thought fit to throw away the greatest advantage he possessed over Capt. WINSLOW, is a mystery. We would have noticed the fact before this, but there were no proofs to hand that the Alabama really had a rifle gun on board. It was known that, when in the West Indies, such a weapon was stowed in her hold, but no one could say positively that it was mounted and constituted part of her battery. Privateering does not need pieces of very long range, except they be such articles as are used by Custom-house officers in searching for contraband goods in passengers' trunks; or by pirates in hooking out costly furs from the wardrobe of the honest skipper's wife. T.A. BLAKELY, the English gun-maker, whose heavy artillery was reported to be a great failure in the hands of BEAUREGARD at Charleston, settles the point as to the Alabama's possession of a rifle. Writing to the London Times, under date of June 22, 1864, he says:",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Semmes as a Naval Fighter.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Semmes as a Naval Fighter.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/263c8b73-5a16-527e-ad3e-614622b0b758,632,nyt://article/263c8b73-5a16-527e-ad3e-614622b0b758,

Arrested wearing part of a Union soldier's skull,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/12/archives/arrest-of-a-female-rebel.html,Arrested wearing part of a Union soldier's skull,"Mrs. HOUGH, wife of WARWICK HOUGH, Adjutant General of the State of Missouri under CLAIR JACKSON, and more recently Captain and Assistant Inspector-General on the staff of the late Gen. LEONIDAS POLK, was arrested in this city yesterday by Capt. TALLON's detectives, and taken before the Provost-Marshal-General. She stated that she was on her way to Jefferson City to see her mother, who she heard was sick. Mrs. HOUGH was closely questioned by Capt. BURDETT, Assistant Provost-Marshal-General, and was quite frank in some of her replies. In her trunk a number of letters were found, and a small piece of the skull of a Union soldier, on which was written ""Wilson's Creek, December 31, 1861."" Mrs. HOUGH said she had preserved this as a memento of the battle. She was sent to the Female Prison, and will be further examined by a military commission. The fact of a lady of refinement carrying about with her a piece of the skull of a human being, as an Indian wears the scalp of a slain enemy in his belt, is so repulsive to the finer feelings of our nature that we must regard Mrs. HOUGH as little better than savage. A short stay in the female Prison may modify her rancor toward Union soldiers, and teach her a lesson which she appears to have forgotten. -- St. Louis Democrat, July 8.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARREST OF A FEMALE REBEL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARREST OF A FEMALE REBEL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/64db1d72-addd-52b4-9b9e-17019d652f9f,229,nyt://article/64db1d72-addd-52b4-9b9e-17019d652f9f,

Beside the exciting military news of the day, we have the naval intelligence that on Friday last the Florida made her appearance near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and the Maryland shore, where she, up to Sunday morning last, captured one schooner and six barks, all of which she burnt, except one that was ransomed, and on Monday she captured the steamer Electric Spark, bound to New-Orleans, which is also believed to have been burned. How much more damage she has done since then it is impossible to say; but, undoubtedly, she is in a region where, for a few days, she can commit great havoc among the coasting and other vessels running from New-York, Boston and other places, to the ports of our Southern seaboard. If she can move quickly, however, so can we. The fact of her appearance can at once be communicated by telegraph to Fortress Monroe, and from thence conveyed to our vessels along the Southern coast; and some of our swiftest armed vessels engaged in the blockading and transport service, as well as such other gunboats as may have been dispatched by the Navy Department, will at once give chase to the rebel.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Naval Rebel Raid.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Naval Rebel Raid.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a671d3ec-8510-5745-bc10-f080d44c0112,602,nyt://article/a671d3ec-8510-5745-bc10-f080d44c0112,

DRIGOS -- whose name will be familiar to our readers in connection with the piano-forte and improvements he has made in its construction during the last ten years -- had entered into an arrangement with a number of capitalists for the manufacture of instruments under his patents. The matter has since crystalized into a very solid corporation. The ""Driggs Patent Piano Company,"" with a capital of half a million dollars, is already in active operation, and promises speedily to become one of the leading manufacturing interests of the metropolis. The warerooms of the company are at No. 3 Union-square, where, if circumstances should be favorable to the inquiring mind, it may be possible for the curious to see a few of the new pianos. The demand at present is so far in advance of the supply that it is with difficulty a stock of instruments is retained for the supply and satisfaction of the public. The Drigg's Patent Piano Company have, we believe, three manufactories, and will, in a short time, be able to turn out twenty-five or thirty pianos a week. Capital cannot materially hasten the mode of production, although in the end it has everything to do with the number produced. Every piano must go through a series of processes which require time for their completion. Especially is this the case with Mr. DRIGG's instruments, which are professedly constructed on a principle that insures their improvement with age, like the violin. The labor market has not been in a very satisfactory condition of fate. It has been disturbed by strikes and combinations for advanced prices that have -- to say the least -- been harassing to the manufacturer. These are now, fortunately, at an end. We learn with satisfaction that the Driggs' Company will, in a short time, be able to supply the market with a fair proportion of their wares. The importance of the piano trade can hardly be over-estimated. Now that a tax has been imposed on the use of the instrument, it is destined to be a source not only of pleasure to the community, but of very considerable income to the Government. Ten years ago it was calculated (rather liberally we think) that the piano trade of the United States amounted, or would soon amount to $50,000,000 per annum. However this may be, we trust that Mr. DRIGGS will come in for his just share of all that it is worth. For a number of years, extending over a period of three apprenticeships such as are usually considered sufficient to learn how to practice a craft, calling or profession, he has devoted himself to the one object of improving the piano. He has invented and reinvented almost every part of its internal structure, and, more than any other maker, has contributed to radical changes being brought into common acceptance and use. The originality of his ideas was of course a source of ridicule to other makers, and, in fact, it required a vast amount of hardihood and conscious knowledge for a gentleman with a theory to insist so tenaciously that the practice of the business for years had been a blunder. It remained only for the judicious mechanic to deny the soft impeachment, and first abuse and then use the ideas that offended him. A man of a less hopeful temperment than Mr. DRIGGS would have succombed to the hostility thus shown to every effort. Mr. DRIGGS, on the contrary, paid but little attention to the attacks made upon him. By a system of induction based on an original theory of acoustics, he quietly sought for truth in his own way, and found it. How to produce a large human sound from the piano -- more grand and continuous than any yet known -- was an early discovery with him. He had a glimmering of the idea in the tone producing plan of the Cremona violin, and quickly adapted it to the requirements of the piano. But there was so wide a difference in the nature of the two instruments that the work of regeneration only commenced here. The perfected Driggs piano of to-day is a novelty in almost every particular of its construction, and represents the ripened fruits of many years of unflagging perseverance; the slow but steady growth of a living idea that could not be killed by the chilling blasts it had to encounter. It is strictly and truly an American piano; simple and effective in its general principles, and ingenious in all its details. The pianos now being made by the company are of the square and oval kinds, and from a careful examination of their merits we are persuaded that they cannot be surpassed. The tone is unusually rich and full; equaling in power an ordinary grand piano, and yet absolutely free from the harshness that is too often a concomitant of strength. Great improvements have also been effected in the ""action;"" the one now used possesses many recommendations, and is pleasant and easy to the touch. Indeed, the many merits of the new instrument should be tested by all who take an interest in this highly important friend of the home circle. It will bear examination, and therefore we direct attention to it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Musical.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Musical.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff4554fa-c2e5-591f-afa0-079998d0a7a5,887,nyt://article/ff4554fa-c2e5-591f-afa0-079998d0a7a5,
"NIBLO's GARDEN. -- To produce a piece called the ""Sea of Ice"" on such a night as last night, was a mockery, a snare and a delusion.

It was in the tropical scenes that the illusion became perfect.

"-- A peculiar and serious accident occurred at the covered bridge near Wilmington, Del., on Sunday night, in which JACOB CHRISTOFFER, Company E, Tenth Regiment Veteran Reserve Corps, had his right foot torn off, and breaking the leg above the knee. It appears that the unfortunate man fell asleep, and while in that state pushed his foot through the open car window, and it coming in contact with the bridge, it was broken and torn off in the most terrible manner. The severed foot came through the next window, flying across the car, and struck one of the passengers, who, in the excitement of the moment, picked it up and thre[???] out of the car. Fortunately, Surgeon J.T. BURL[???]E, Thirteenth New-York Cavalry, was on board the train, who, in the absence of all instruments or bandage, tied up the shattered limb with a collection of handkerchiefs, and in that state the sufferer remained until the train reached Havre de Grace, where he was taken in charge by the Surgeon of the Post. It was feared that the wound would prove fatal. This is not the first accident of the kind that has happened at this bridge.

The latest information from Washington is brought to Baltimore by a gentleman who left the former city at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, at which time there was no fighting going on. Philadelphia furnishes its usual quantity of wild sensation reports, even going so far as to telegraph last evening that Washington had been captured. Telegraphic communication has been promptly restored between Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the damage to the Gunpowder Bridge is ascertained to be four hundred feet entirely burned, and about four hundred partly damaged. It is estimated that the repoirs will require frome four to seven days. The rebels appear to have moved away from the vicinity of the railroad, and from the immediate neighborhood of Baltimore. Yesterday morning, our cavalry dashed into Frederick City, routed the rebel guard of one hundred men left there, and recaptured the place. But little damage had been done ta the place, the citizens having paid a ransom of $20,000. From Hagerstown, it is reliably reported that there are no rebels west of South Mountain, and that Gen.

Particulars of Death,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/13/archives/the-death-of-lieutgen-polk.html,Particulars of Death,"-- The Atlanta Register of the 16th ult. gives the particulars of the death of Lieut.-Gen. LEONIDAS POLE, which do not differ materially from the accounts we have already published. He was in company at the time with Gens. JOHNSTON, HARDEE and JACKSON, upon Pine Mountain, in the rear of the batteries of the Washington Artillery from New-Orleans. They had all dismounted, and with their respective staffs had walked out to observe the Federal position, which was about 900 yards distant. Some one suggested that they would be apt to attract an unfriendly fire, and a few moments afterward a shell fell a little short of the party. The order was given to disperse, and the party divided and walked off in different directions, JOHNSTON and POLK together; the latter exposed himself by walking somewhat higher upon the brow of the hill, the former being below him. It was in this position and Gen. POLK was struck by the second shell which was fired. It went entirely through his breast, shattering the left arm about the elbow, crushing the breast and spine terribly, and shattering the right arm as it passed out. Col. YALE, his son-in-law and member of his staff, seeing him fall, rushed toward him, but, save a slight quivering of the chin as the Colonel raised his head from the earth, all other signs of life had fled. The Register states that after this the firing was continued, but our information leads us to believe that only the two shells were fired, as Gen. SHERMAN's object was entirely accomplished when he dispersed the group of officers who were making the reconnoissance of his position. Gen. POLK had in his coat pocket when killed his prayer-book and three copies of the Rev. Dr. QUINTARD's little work, entitled ""Balm for the Weary and Wounded,"" which were intended as presents for Gens. JOHNSTON, HARDEE and HOOD, as their names were inscribed on the fly-leaves, with ""the compliments of Lieut.-Gen.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/13/archives/amusements.html,,"OLYMPIC THEATRE. -- AUBER's opera of ""Fra Diavola"" was revived here on Monday evening, and attracted a good and fashionable audience. It has evidently been put on the stage in great haste, and without that regard to preparatory rehearsal, which the light but delicate music of the French composer demanded. Some of the principal singers were at fault, and the concerted music generally hobbled rather than moved. ""Fra Diavolo"" makes a rather serious demand on the limited resources of the company. The caste involves not only good leading artists, but very good secondary ones, and these in the present state of the musical market are difficult to supply. At the Olympic they are exceedingly bad. The gentleman who played the part of Lord Allcash must have been selected by mistake, and under the impression that the burlesque and not the opera was to be performed. The Lorenzo, too, was tender to a degree of absolute softness. Mr. CASTLE's Fra Diavolo was less angular than his Don Caesar, and his dress, if possible, more absurd. The music of the role does not lie in the best part of his voice, and hence in the concerted pieces the latter was not heard to advantage. Still the performance indicates improvement. Mr. CAMPBELL's Beppo was the best sustained part in the opera. His make-up was excellent. The Zerlina of Made. BORCHARD was good, but a little too mature for the ""Innkeeper's lovely, daughter."" The graceful vivacity which characterised this lady's acting whilst at the Park Theatre, Brooklyn, seems to have deserted her now that she is on a somewhat larger stage. Miss LOUISA MYERS, as Lady Allcash, acted very prettily, but is scarcely equal to the musical requirements of the part.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b494730b-c39c-5591-a1ac-3d684bd3ee5b,385,nyt://article/b494730b-c39c-5591-a1ac-3d684bd3ee5b,

This is the third time that these States have been invaded, and every time the enemy has found them totally unprepared to receive him, although the Governors possess full power, under the existing law, to put every able-bodied man under arms. Year after year, with full knowledge of the fact that a ""rebel raid"" across the Potomac was one of the likeliest incidents of each campaign, the people of these States have waited in perfect tranquillity until he had made his appearance in large force. The appearance of parties of cavalry, or even of a division, is not sufficient to rouse them. There has to be ""reliable"" information of the arrival of a corps or two before the great ""rush to arms"" is made, or the war meetings are convened. The Governor first calls for regiments; but as the regiments do not appear with the necessary rapidity, or, in fact, appear at all, the enemy continues to advance, harry and lay waste. The Governor then offers to receive volunteers by companies, and companies begin to be raised, but just at this moment telegraphic communication is suspended, and the curtain falls on a great mob of ""citizens,"" running into the towns for shelter, and threatening the rebels with vengeance dire, if he does not immediately run away, which he never does till the United States have been gathered from all quarters of the Union to repel him. What makes this all the more inexcusable is, that there is little doubt that the present raid will cost more to Pennsylvania and Maryland, in the destruction of property and the suspension of business, than it would have cost to have kept 60,000 militia under arms for the last four years.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Military Reserve of the Nation The Duty of the States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Military Reserve of the Nation The Duty of the States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da0b2472-9880-5c74-a20e-4f894ce474c6,770,nyt://article/da0b2472-9880-5c74-a20e-4f894ce474c6,

The guests were very numerous, upward of 2,000 visitors being present, of whom a large share were ladies. The entertainments offered this large assemblage were varied, and gave delight to all. At 6 P.M., there was an Indian clam bake; at 9 o'clock an exhibition of fireworks, interspersed with the performances of a brass band; at 10 1/2 o'clock dancing was the order for the remainder of the night, except an intermission at 12 o'clock for a substantial supper, crowned abundantly with ice-cream. The club-house is located on a charming promontory, on and overlooking Long Island Sound, and is surrounded with a spacious and pleasant grove. The dancing took place upon a broad platform in front of the house, and in a large hall level with the platform, and opening upon it with several doors and windows. The pyrotechnics were fired from a small island about six hundred feet out from and directly in front of the club-grounds. The intervening space of water heightened the effects of the exhibition in a high degree. Supervisor WM. M. TWERD, President, Ex-Alderman CHAS. H. HALL, Secretary of the Club, and Street Commissioner CORNELL, Aldermen JONES, SHANNON, and FOX, and Councilmen KEENAN, BRADY, and HAGERTY, and also Police Justices HOGAN and SHANDLEY, who are connected with it, were indefatigable in efforts to promote the comfort and pleasure of the guests, who departed with high opinions of the personnel of the Club, and filled with admiration at the neatness and taste everywhere exhibited about the house and grounds.

The absolute inutility of piling book upon book, while no guide is preferred to inform the student of their existence even, was never displayed more forcibly than in the United States, where the publicity attending all State proceedings, the general habit of reading and writing, among all classes, and the facility of printing -- combine to create a mass of documentary evidence greater in bulk and superior in authenticity to the archives of any other nation. How much of this is utterly unserviceable to the historical inquirer for want of proper bibliographical guides, is obvious to all. The neglect of this essential aid is the more remarkable when the passion (or mania, as it may almost be called,) for possessing and collecting rare books, tracts, manuscript, &c., on American history at prices that seems almost fabulous, is considered. But there is extant no general list of books on America, no catalogue of the legislative documents or Congressional papers of the United States Government, and until the publication of the volume before us, no State had taken the trouble to enumerate and classify the materials from which its history must be gathered. The Spaniards, even, are centuries before us in this matter. As early as 1629, Don LEON PINELO published a catalogue of writers on the Spanish possessions in America and the East, which, as enlarged by BARCIA, in 1726, forms three volumes in folio. England, too, has the American Bibliographies of WHITE KENNETT, (1713,) and REID, (1789,) and France can adduce the ""Bibliotheque Americaine"" of TERNAUX COMPANS, (1837.) We have nothing to compare with these but the ""Bibliotheca Americana,"" by Mr. O. RICH, which, though the work of an American, was written and printed in England, and two productions of a German scholar, M. LUDWIG, who devoted himself to the pursuit with ardor, and died prematurely, after preparing his ""Literature of American Local History,"" and of ""American Aboriginal Languages.' So comparatively unoccupied is the field in which Mr. BARTLETT appears as a gleaner, and though his labors are confined to a corner of its vast extent, it is only by a similar partition of industry that anything satisfactory can be accomplished. The plan of his bibliography is to give the title of every printed book and pamphlet that relates, in any way, to the State of Rhode Island, including the biographies of men prominent in its annals, and of natives of the State distinguished in public life, or who, by their virtues and good deeds, deserve to be remembered. The abundance of material afforded by this State, so small in geographical extent, may be judged when it is seen that the present bibliography contains nearly three hundred handsomely and closely printed pagesembodying, at a rough calculation, about two thousand titles of distinct works and editions, most of which are accompanied by the interesting bibliographical or literary notes of the laborious editor. Mr. BARTLETT is already most favorably known to the historical world by the noble publication of the Early Colonial Records of his native State, in ten volumes, an undertaking set on foot and most ably edited and superintended by him, in his official capacity of Secretary of State. The same industry and diligence are visible in every page of the Rhode Island Bibliography, and it leaves nothing to be desired in respect to printing and style of ""getting up."" It is printed by order of the General Assembly, and only a limited number are reserved for miscellaneous sale. It will undoubtedly, at no distant day, become a scarce book.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; BIBLIOGRAPHY OF RHODE ISLAND.

The case was sent to trial. An iron-plated vessel, supposed to be intended as a successor to the Alabama, had gone out from Bordeaux. From a statement made in the House of Commons, it appears that orders have been sent out to canada to have the British forces stationed in that Colony concentrated at Quebec and Montreal. An attempt to get a vote of censure on the British Government, in connection with their policy in Japan, was made in the House of Lords on the 1st inst., and failed by 30 to 11. On the third reading of the Oxford University Tests Bill in the House of Commons the Government were defeated, the vote being 171 for the bill, and 173 againts.

Parliamentary Test Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/14/archives/the-party-test-vote-in-england.html,Parliamentary Test Vote,"-- The British mail, received yesterday by the Australasian brings no new facts bearing on the proposed party test vote which was to be taken in the House of Commons on Monday, the 4th of July. We have some new and ingenious calculations, however, as to the strength the Conservatives will show on that occasion. The highest figuring gives them 271 votes, which would be all they want. But there appears to be not even the shadow of a chance of their showing any such a front. The policy on the Dano-German question turns out to be practically the same as that of the Whigs, to talk much, and talk sympathizingly of Denmark, but do nothing. The debate, however, will afford an opportunity for the indulgence, to the fullest extent, of that trenchant criticism of which Mr. DISRAELI is so thorough a master. His speech will doubtless be the chief feature of the discussion, as nearly everything the Government can say in self-justification has already been said by Lord PALMERSTON, in presenting the result of the Conference deliberations to Parliament.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PARTY TEST VOTE IN ENGLAND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PARTY TEST VOTE IN ENGLAND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ef57ae6-9c33-547c-bc00-939f89435e48,180,nyt://article/5ef57ae6-9c33-547c-bc00-939f89435e48,

The Magnolia Raid,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/14/archives/the-rebel-guerillas.html,The Magnolia Raid,"-- We publish an intelligent account of the rebel raid on Magnolia Station, on Monday last, from a gentleman who was a passenger on one of the captured trains. He puts the number of rebels engaged in this affair as very small -- less than a hundred; and shows that it was simply of a predatory and plundering character. The rebel robbers carried on operations after the true classic style of highwaymen. They protested that they would in no way interfere with the private property of passengers, and then coolly proceeded to rob all the folks aboard the train. They broke open and rifled trunks, valises and carpet-bags, stole money, watches, shirt-studs and everything they could lay their paws on. They stole eight hundred dollars from a sailor boy just discharged the service, and two dollars and fifty cents from a poor old man -- every farthing he had. All this time they were loudly proclaiming their honorable intentions. They also burned and robbed houses after the same fashion. The raid had no military object whatever. It was quite akin in character to the operations of a gang of Mexican guerrillas, though they did not carry the matter quite so far as is frequently done by the latter, who, often after robbing a train, strip the clothing from the passengers, and send them into the city in the costume in which Job came into the world.

This last movement of theirs is of that nature. We have pointed out more than once of late the immense strength Of GRANT'S position on the Appomattox. It has appeared, we think, conclusively, that if our great army but remain firmly planted where it now is, and if our cavalry arm operate constantly and trenchantly upon the communications of the rebel capital, it will be quite impossible for LEE and his army, or JEFF. DAVIS and his Government, to remain long in Richmond. ""A city invested is a city taken,"" for the simple reason that if the besiegers can but maintain their lines, the garrison must ultimately succumb from want. Richmond has never yet been, and is not now, invested, technically speaking; but the military axiom just quoted is perfectly applicable to it, if Gen. GRANT, from his impregnable position in its rear, can, by his cavalry arm, describe a line around it sufficient to cut off from it the essential supplies derived from the great producing regions of the Confederacy. Now, in the first place, Gen. GRANT has shown, within the past fortnight, that this is perfectly feasible and practicable; and in the next place, on the other hand, Gen. LEE perfectly comprehends the impossibility of dislodging GRANT from his present ground, either by direct assault upon it or by manoeuvering round it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Rebel Movement Its Character.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Rebel Movement Its Character.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/824b3f5a-5669-5fd3-b26e-136305e26961,777,nyt://article/824b3f5a-5669-5fd3-b26e-136305e26961,

Much praise is due to Capt. H.H. MARTIN and the crew of the Arctic, and also to Mr. E. LITTLEFIELD, Agent of the Fall River Line, who hired a wagon to take the man to the hospital on the Battery, and directed that he should be comfortably cared for at his expense.

Our troops at length took the defensive and charged upon the enemy, driving him precipitately from the position. The rebel column, it seems, at once took up its retreat, passing through Rockville at 3 o'clock yesterday morning, on the march to Poolesville and Edward's Ferry. At the latter place, the dispatch says, the rebels were engaged in crossing their wagons and plunder collected during the raid. Our loss in the fighting on Tuesday was about two hundred killed and wounded. The rebels left over one hundred of their wounded at Silver Spring. There was no damage done to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on the Washington branch, and the rebels failed to destroy the iron bridge over the Monocacy, on the main stem. Both Gens.

In the Tyrol, Switzerland, and many parts of Germany, rifle-shooting is a constant and popular sport. In England, the organization and drill of the Rifle Volunteers have developed through the country a very respectable amount of skill in the use of this arm. We now stand in fearful need of a better proficiency in the use of the long-range rifle. It does not differ in its construction, necessarily, from our old hunting rifles, except in the sight and the form of the projectile. The Swiss military rifle, according to Maj. MORDECAI's report, is essentially an American hunting rifle, with an elevating sight, and an elongated but simple projectile. The bore is quite small, being only about what is called seventy to the pound. The shot weighs about half the weight of our new rifle musket shot -- say 257 grains. This rifle has the longest range, and the most deadly flight, as well as more accuracy, than any military small arm in the world. An arm possessing every possible accuracy and good quality can be made in this country, in ordinary times, for about $30, and by the quantity for much less.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POPULAR PRACTICE WITH THE RIFLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'POPULAR PRACTICE WITH THE RIFLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f20ddf87-393f-5cdf-8322-9fbdcffe8ac9,475,nyt://article/f20ddf87-393f-5cdf-8322-9fbdcffe8ac9,
"It has so often appeared certain that the Hudson's Bay Company's monopoly of seventy thousand square miles of territory, on this continent, was about to be overthrown, when in reality the Company was only about to acquire a new lease, that the public, both here and in England, have ceased to believe in any official promises given in the premises.

London Star; Operations Against Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/16/archives/operations-against-richmond.html,London Star; Operations Against Richmond,"The ground we have recently and repeatedly taken as to the feasibility of reducing the rebel capital by operating trenchantly upon its lines of communication and supply from our superb position at Petersburgh, is well sustained by an astute military writer in the London Star of the 27th ult. He says that the problem which Gen. GRANT has to solve is one of the hardest in war -- viz., how to take a city, not a fortification in the ordinary sense of the term, which can be invested, but the centre of an intrenched camp, occupied by an army of one hundred thousand men. It is the very problem which all but baffled the united forces of England, France, Sardinia and Turkey, during the Crimean war. Nothing can exceed the strength of LEE's position, which is that of a General who has fallen back upon his base, to which the whole South is more or less open for the purpose of supplies in man, provisions, ammunition, hospital stores, clothing, and the various requirements of an army. Practically it would be impregnable to an army assaulting it from the north side, unless that army were nearly double in point of numbers, and even then the only omnipotent weapon would be the spade. The superiority of the James River as the Federal base consists mainly in its relation to Lee's line of supplies and retreat. The difficulty and apparent helplessness of the Allies at Sebastopol, lay in their inability to get at the routes by which the vast resources of Russia were poured into the city -- so much so that they were glad to act on the principle that half a loaf was better than no bread, and be content with the conquest of the southern portion only.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Operations Against Richmond.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Operations Against Richmond.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e4f24a9-8e77-597f-8ca6-2e52c5b15c62,636,nyt://article/9e4f24a9-8e77-597f-8ca6-2e52c5b15c62,

BROWN'S views of State rights bring him into collision with the Confederate authorities in reference to other matters than the Georgia railroads, which JOHNSTON was going to destroy as he was ""drawing"" SHERMAN toward Atlanta, but did not because of Gov. BROWN'S protests. It seems that the Rebel Congress some time since passed a law that every vessel which took cotton out through the blockade should take half of her cargo on account of the Confederacy. This was a very good move, because it enabled the rebel Government to get its cotton out in order to raise funds to buy supplies. Some of the State authorities also desired to export cotton, but they did not think it proper that this prohibition should be extended to the vessels owned or chartered by a Sovereign State -- and so the Governors of Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and North Carolina, in April last, joined in a representation to the rebel Congress, stating that, when they desired to send out cotton in this way, they were met by an order from Mr. MEMMINGER preventing the vessels from clearing unless they had taken half their cargo for the Confederacy; and the Governors argued the question not only on grounds of expediency, but also on Constitutional grounds, denying that the power ""to regulate commerce among the States"" gave the rebel Congress power to put such a restriction upon the States, although they do not seem to have denied its power to apply the same restriction to individuals, and they boldly declared that when it was ""in their power to assist the Confederate Government with State vessel they would do so with great pleasure, but they would not consent to do it under compulsion,"" not though State vessels were as plenty as persimmons.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'State Rights in Rebeldom.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'State Rights in Rebeldom.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BLOCKADE', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68ca5054-3df1-5eeb-a12a-11153b5ce76c,678,nyt://article/68ca5054-3df1-5eeb-a12a-11153b5ce76c,

It may be generally stated that all regiments sent from the City in answer to the call of the Government for one hundred days' men will be held until the expiration of their term of service. Those regiments which proposed to enlist for thirty, sixty and ninety days, to repel the invasion of Maryland, will probably not be called into the field. The regiments ordered to march to Washington are making preparations for their departure. Information has been obtained from headquarters that none of them will leave before to-morrow. The work of recruiting is going on rapidly. Supervisor BLUNT averages about twenty-five enlistments per day, and Col. NUGENT has obtained nearly one hundred men who are to enter the army as substitutes for commuters. This means of filling the ranks of the army has been largely made use of by patriotic gentlemen exempted from draft. In several instances men over sixty years of age have subscribed for substitutes. The preparations for the State draft, ordered by Gov. SEYMOUR, to fill up the National Guard regiments, are going forward, under the superintendence of Col. S.R. PINCKNEY. It is expected the work will be completed this week, when the enrollment lists will be ready for correction. Brig.-Gen. A.S. WEBB has been detailed by the Secretary of War as superintendent of recruiting of the Second Corps in this State, and will visit Albany and Elmira with a view to organizing Hancock recruiting committees in those cities.

According to those explanations, the conduct of the British Government has been from first to last altogether blameless. The sole object of Earl RUSSELL was to bring Denmark to reason, and to allay the irritation of Germany; and when he could not accomplish one or the other of these things, and war broke out, he philanthropically called a conference to effect a compromise, and to induce both parties to settle their differences. The conference, however, could no more accomplish this feat than Earl RUSSELL himself, and so the armistice is at an end, and the conflict has been renewed. But why should England be held accountable for these unfortunate results, or be bound any more than Russia, Sweden, or France, to succor the Danes? The great interests of England everywhere constrain her to remain at peace -- the looming up of a vast military and naval Trans-Atlantic Power requires her to act with circumspection.

It was high carnival time among the prophets of evil. They had foreseen it all. They bad spoken one to another, and it had come to pass even as they had said. They knew what would be the upshot.

"It is gratifyingto know that the frigate Neshamony, which is intended to operate against privateers, and which, by reason of her size, model and powerful machinery, is expected to do good service, is rapidly progressing, and that she will be ready for launching in the month of August. The frame of the frigate has been strengthened in a way that insures great resistance to ordinary-sized shot and shell; and as her boilers will be entirely below the water line, there is no fear of their being touched by any shot that may penetrate her hull. The Neshamony will be able to carry as large in armament as any vessel afloat, she being about 350 feet long and 4,000 tons burden. A large force is now engaged upon the frigate, and the Government desires her to be completed as soon as possible. Should she not be delayed by her machinery, she may be got ready for sea by the early part of the Fall.

Markets a d Currency,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/18/archives/the-markets-and-the-currency.html,Markets a d Currency,"The occurrences of the past few days in the produce and money markets show pretty conclusively how completely we may rely, after all, on the operations of the laws of trade to protect the public against the machinations of the speculators. For manyweeks back almost all the necessaries of life have been bought up in enormous quantities, and ""held for a rise,"" by a number of large operators. Prices did rise accordingly, and the consumers, and especially the poor, who have to make their purchases from day to day, suffered accordingly. As is usual after a period of great speculation, there followed what is termed a tightness in the market -- that is, difficulty in borrowing money at all, or at any but high rates of interest. The banks found themselves obliged to contract their loans, partly as a measure of prudence, and partly of necessity. The enormous rise in prices of course called for a greater quantity of currency to do the work of exchange, and the rashness of the speculators naturally inspired greater caution in dealing with them. When the price of things doubles, it of course needs -- not double the quantity of the circulating medium -- for the quantity required depends partly on the rapidity of circulation, or, in other words, the multiplicity of transactions -- but a very much larger quantity than before, to enable people to carry on their business. The speculators in this case calculated on having this required addition supplied by the Treasury in the shape of a fresh issue of legal tenders. But this relief has not come; in other words, the laws of trade have been left to take their course. They hoped to be able to borrow in order to enable them to continue to hold, and they relied on a fresh expansion of the currency to carry the prices up to the point at which they desired to sell. They have been disappointed in both cases, and have been left to get out of their scrape precisely as they would have had to get out of it in the old days of specie payments. Like all speculators, they have saddled themselves with more goods than they were able to pay for, and finding it impossible to borrow money to meet their engagements, there is nothing left but to sell out. Once this process begins, a panic of course sets in, and prices fall with a daily accelerating ratio. We have accordingly had a fall of thirty per cent. in gold, and from ten to twenty per cent. within the last three or four days in nearly every species of produce.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Markets and the Currency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Markets and the Currency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MARKETS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6bb78619-59e7-57c4-af96-982dc4c1d4fc,815,nyt://article/6bb78619-59e7-57c4-af96-982dc4c1d4fc,

They are not only a little blind to his faults, and very kind to his virtues, but in their indiscriminate admiration they seem to have lost all power of distinguishing between these two classes of qualities. Hence his arrogant and insolent treatment of all former laborers in the same track, passes current for honest intrepidity of speech; his tedious and vapid pedantry is accepted for humor, and the ""mud volcano"" of unsavoring epithets, that bespatters the unfortunate subjects of his wrath, is the outpouring of a righteous indignation to those who regard him as the most finished historian, the profoundest philosopher, and the most nervous writer of the age. There are many, no doubt, not prepared to go to these preposterous lengths, who will look with interest on this new installment of a work that will always command respect as a monument of strenuous labor, however great its misapplication. It embraces about thirteen years of FREDERICK the Great's life, including the Second Silesian War, Ten Years of Peace, and the First Campaign of the Seven Years' War. Just thirty years of a career always eventful in incident remain to be treated of, and these must demand at least three additional volumes, and may, at the uncertain pleasure of the author, be made to furnish material for a much greater number. The first duty of a historian is to write what will be read. Unless this point is secured everything else goes for nothing. Now, it is perfectly safe to say that a work in seven or eight volumes, of the style and composition of the History of Frederick, cannot possibly maintain its place among the standard living literature of the language, but must drift aside, and merely serve in the end to increase the number of the ""dry-as-dust sand heaps,"" ""unsifted marine stories,"" &c., that clog the way of the historical inquirer, and excite the measureless scorn of Mr. CARLYLE himself. For what results from his painful labors, in their dusty regions, that call forth groans so interminable from their self-appointed explorer? Are the matertals thus collected used for the construction of a symmetrical work of art; a book, in short, such as the world is always ready to welcome, displaying competent knowledge of its subject, and written with the honest aim of elucidating a portion of the history of the past? Nothing of the kind is to be found in CARLYLE's Frederick. It is simply a new tossing about of the contents of those ""sad Prussian Repositories,"" and ""dismal Literary Diatribes,"" in defiance of all human arrangement, and in a spirit so partial and strong in its prepossessions' that no student could safely accept its conclusions without a reviewal of the whole mass of authorities. The uncouthness of the form under which the writer's deductions are presented, is too well-known to all readers to need dwelling on, but his utter incompetence to grasp any but the coarsest lights and shades of FREDERICK's character is well illustrated in this volume, where the great King's legal and economic reforms -- the measures that gave his realm the strength necessant to support its existence through the awful crisis of a seven years' struggle -- are dismissed in two or three pages, as belonging to an ""orthodox dismal science"" that the writer has no sympathy with, while a closely printed chapter of twenty-two pages is devoted to M. VOLTAIRE's ""powerful Jew law-suit,"" a wretched and obsolete stock-jobbing squabble; and his indecorous relations with his ""divine EMILIE"" (Madame DU CHATELET) are investigated with equal minuteness in another. In spite of his denunciations of ""garbage"" and ""demon reporters,"" matter of this kind is not wanting in various portions of the book. Mr. CARLYLE's intellectual position is an unfortunate one. With all the fervor of wrath and stubborn obstinacy of opinion that inspired his countrymen, the old Covenanters, his philosophy has led him far away from their stand-point and their belief in the immediate divine government of the world has given place to mere ""inarticulate shriekings"" about ""the destinies,"" ""the immensities,"" &c., and with all the passions of a devotee nothing remains for his worship but an empty shrine, where his false gospel of ""brute force"" is installed, and hymned with uncouth praises of her favorite sons, the Cromwells and Fredericks, whom CARLYLE especially delights to honor; of course, one who formerly wrote so well cannot, even when willfully perverse, bring out a book without many striking touches of description, graphic bits of character painting, dramatic scenes, &c., and for the sake of these the pages of FREDERICK's life will be turned over by lazy readers, who enjoy the excitement afforded by a good hater; but for one who derives his idea of the Prussian King from CARLYLE's laborious farrago, a thousand will draw their impressions from the brilliant sketch -- unfortunately not completed -- that MACAULAY has devoted to his life and history. What is clear is often condemned as superficial, and the shallow profound will always have its admirers; but in this case the clamorous and turbulent research of the one writer has produced nothing that need modify the estimate of his hero formed by the other, whose exquisite art in the concealment of an was never more favorably displayed than in this memorable article. Messrs. HARPER's edition of The Life of Frederick is favorably distinguished from many American editions by the possession of all the illustrations, military maps, &c., of the English copy and a complete index.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH THE SECOND, CALLED FREDERICK THE GREAT.

Many persons come to look at an army as something by itself, outside of American life, and not very much open to any influence of a religious organization. We shall all understand the army and the work of the two Commissions better, if we simply reflect that this great and historic body of men is made up of young men, very much like the brother or son or kinsman of any one of ourselves. Each soldier has his past individual history, his own private struggles with the problems of life, his temptations, his hopes, his loneliness and heart-sickness, his desire for a more manly character, and his looking forward to the unseen and eternal, just like any one of our own nearest friends. His individuality is not destroyed in the army; on the contrary, it is often more developed. And, just as for our young boy or brother or cousin in camp, we would wish certain influences upon his character -- just as, if he were lying wasting with dysentery on the hospital pallet, or wearing the long hours away as the bullet-wound slowly heals, or recovering from the deep depression and prostration of the typhoid, or dying lonely in some sick ward, with only strangers around him, we would be glad to have cheering words spoken to him of the best and truest things, and the way of life pointed out, and the hope of immortality held up, and a prayer breathed out to sweeten the last moments, so we may wish for the whole army, and so we may understand the nature and value of such labors as those of the Christian Commission.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHRISTIAN COMMISSION.; Portsmouth Hospitals.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CHRISTIAN COMMISSION.; Portsmouth Hospitals.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90c5338c-772b-5755-a046-9e6efb71d3fd,1135,nyt://article/90c5338c-772b-5755-a046-9e6efb71d3fd,

The goods remain as they were left on Friday evening, after the fire. Nothing appears to have been removed. The large quantity of hides on storage is burned to a crisp, the guano is exposed and looks like a heap of dust, the sugar and molasses are mingled with the dirt, and the nitrate of soda, what there is left, lays about loose. Several persons anxious to try experiments as to the explosive qualities of nitrate of soda, satisfied themselves a little before noon yesterday. Some bags, which had been saturated with water, were tried. Matches were applied, and the result was -- a fire. There was a puff, and flame, and smoke arose sufficient to attract the attention of the Fire Department, which turned out very promptly. It was reported that the experimenters were blown overboard, but such is not the fact. They became convinced, however, that nitrate of soda would ignite on the application of fire. It is not definitely known in what manner the original fire was caused. Some of the workmen state that the men in the office threw stumps of cigars out of the windows, which fell among the explosive materials, while others think that it originated in some other way, which they cannot explain. The workmen were at dinner at the time the fire originated, and thus escaped harm. The buildings along Forman-street show the effect of the numerous explosions. The rear doors and windows were broken, the chimneys were tumbled down, and everything in the houses trembled with the concussions. The debris caused by the falling of the ceilings has since been carried into the street, and still lies there in remembrance of the disaster.

The words are applicable on this as well as on the other side of the rebel lines. ""Let us,"" he says, ""earnestly beseech our people to faithfully and steadily work and hope for results, but let us not imitate the enemy in vain and premature boasts. Let us not make ourselves a laughing stock of Europe, by winning victories on paper not yet won on the field. Let us not quicken the popular pulse at home with dreams and prophecies of glorious victory; for no expected evil harms half so much as the blood that leaps forth in the ecstacy of triumph, ebbing back in sick convulsion upon the disappointed heart. Often have our people been deceived by false and delusive hopes, gotten up with the best intention in the world, by those who think they help our cause by proclaiming victory in the thickest of peril.

In 1855 a suit was instituted by the Attorney General for Ireland, at the relation of Mr. JOHN REA, solicitor, against certain members of the Bellast Corporation, for having exceeded their borrowing powers, and the Lord Chancellor declared the defendants responsible for the sums overborrowed, amounting altogether to £183,000. Since that time several attempts have been made by the corporation and its friends to obtain the consent of their opponents, who are all of the Liberal party, to a bill of indemnity, but Mr. REA and those who act with him have declared that, inasmuch as the corporation has hitherto been exclusively in the hands of the Tories, who have used their influence to disfranchise their opponents, the only terms on which they will consent to an Indemnity Bill are the complete polical reorganization of the to loan council, to be followed, as they confidently assert it will, by the return of Liberal representatives for many of the constituencies in Ulster that now return Conservatives. Several bills introduced into Parliament to legalize the excessive expenditure have been vigorously opposed by the Liberals; and up to this time not less than £30,000 has been spent on either side, in a contest which has now lasted over nine years. In 1862 the matters in dispute were submitted to arbitration, the Right Hon. the Colonial Minister, who was the Chief Secretary for Ireland, acting as umpire, and a bill was introduced during the present session, and passed through the Commons, confirming the award, on condition that a public bill should be introduced to prevent, if possible, the further disfranchisement of Liberal ratepayers, and to remedy the other grievances complained of. The public bill introduced by Sir HUGH CAIRNS being considered wholly inadequate, no fewer than five petitions were presented to the House of Lords against the Private Indemnity Bill, and referred to a committee, consisting of Earl GREY (chairman), Lords NELSON, RIVERS, WROTTESLEY, and MELVILLE.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXTRAORDINARY SCENE.

Bavis vs Bayard; Wool Suit at Cleveland,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/18/archives/important-wool-suit.html,Bavis vs Bayard; Wool Suit at Cleveland,"-- A suit of some interest to dealers in wool is likely to come before the next term of the United States District Court. The facts of the case, as alleged in the statement of the plaintiff, are that H.C. DAVIS, the plaintiff in the suit, a wool-dealer of Philadelphia, contracted to purchase a considerable amount of wool from D.B. BAYRD, of Stark County, O. After the contract had been made, the price of wool advanced, and eigteen thousand pounds of wool, included in the contract, were sold by BAYRD to another person at a price above that for which it was contracted by DAVIS. But wool advanced still further, and BAYRD, instead of delivering to either first or second buyers, sold the wool to still another person at still higher rates. On learning these facts, DAVIS commenced proceedings in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and Deputy United States Marshal SIMMONS went down and replevined the wool while in transit to the last purchasers. It was taken to Alliance by the Deputy Marshal, and shipped to Cleveland. About an hour after SIMMONS left with his prize, another suit of replevin came from the second purchaser, but it came too late. The suit is of considerable interest, from the fact that there has been considerable looseness of ideas among some owners of wool and other property as to what constitutes a bargain -- Cleveland Herald, 8th.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IMPORTANT WOOL SUIT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'IMPORTANT WOOL SUIT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff051d21-33c3-56e0-8836-b88f44a2cf90,241,nyt://article/ff051d21-33c3-56e0-8836-b88f44a2cf90,

Of all places, you always expect to find in a military hospital discouragement and despondency. Whatever there is of low spirits in an army will be sure to be concentrated there. The great disease of the camps -- typhoid -- always lays its hand first on the hopeful tendencies of the man; then the forced inactivity, the weary hours, the time for thought and the pain of a sick bed, do not usually strengthen the will or raise the cheerfulness of the patient; so that, if there is any cause for discouragement, you will be sure to learn it in a hospital. I have been visiting now in the work of the Christian Commission, hundreds of these suffering men from the regiments of almost every free State. The soldiers of Maine and Minnesota, Maryland and Iowa, lie side by side. They must be in every respect a very fair representation of the Army of the Potomac, and I think I may say from scarcely one have I ever heard a word of doubt or despondency about our cause. A Maine lumberman, with his foot shot through said yesterday, with that kind of light in his eyes which means earnestness, that he would give the world to be back again and ""help it through."" Last week, I saw a Pennsylvanian from Luzerne County, whose father left a prosperous business and went to the first Bull Run, where he was killed, and who was followed successively by seven sons, every one of whom had been shot, or had died in the war, except my informant, the last of the family, and he had been wounded fourtimes. Three of his brothers, he said, were in the Chickahominy swamps. One died at Yorktown, another on the Mississippi, and so on. And yet he meant to see the thing through! He was one of those quiet, determined, religious men, who had evidently entered on this war, from duty, and did not mean to give up, while a hope was left.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PORTSMOUTH HOSPITALS.; Spirit of the Sick and Wounded Soldiers Their Devotion to the Cause.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PORTSMOUTH HOSPITALS.; Spirit of the Sick and Wounded Soldiers Their Devotion to the Cause.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1a2279a2-8341-590e-9518-3bba9ced2482,1212,nyt://article/1a2279a2-8341-590e-9518-3bba9ced2482,

The military authorities appear to be discouraged with this turn of affairs, and it is doubtful whether any energetic efforts will be made to fill the quota. The Fifty-sixth Regiment is substantially used up, and the Twenty-eighth has made but very little progress so far. The filling of the quota from Kings County will therefore be very uncertain.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Military Affairs in Brooklyn.; THE FIFTY-SIXTH REGIMENT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Military Affairs in Brooklyn.; THE FIFTY-SIXTH REGIMENT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ff85142-bbda-5d3a-adbb-61675b74a87d,234,nyt://article/7ff85142-bbda-5d3a-adbb-61675b74a87d,

Florida; Will She Go to Europe?,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/20/archives/will-the-florida-go-to-europe.html,Florida; Will She Go to Europe?,"It seems by the news from Europe Chat the Florida was expected to arrive in European waters during the early part of this month. The Kearsarge was on the lookout for her, and the Niagara put to sea very suddenly, in order to be on hand for her. We should not wonder if there had been some real foundation for this expectation. What if it had been planned by the Florida and Alabama to meet each other there, and together to attack the Kearsarge, or some other of our vessels? What if in pursuance of this plan the Florida left Bermuda, and ran round by our coast burning vessels as she was doing a short time since, and then kept on north and east across the Atlantic? If this was their plan, it has been frustrated. Whether because Capt. SEMMES did not count upon being ordered out of Cherbourg so soon, or because the Florida did not. come round in time, their joint arrangement, if any such there was, has been spoiled by the sinking of the Alabama; and instead of there being two rebel vessels to attack one of ours, the Captain of the Florida will find, if he goes there, that he has two of our vessels to escape from instead of one. The London Globe speaking of this says, that no doubt the Captain of the Florida will see to it that he is not caught between two fires. No doubt he will if he can. Indeed, we have no doubt that he will avoid exposing himself to one fire, to say nothing of two. He will have learned of the fate of SEMMES and of the ""great dissatisfaction"" which was felt in England because he lost the Alabama, and he will be careful how he exposes himself to that dissatisfaction by exposing his vessel to the shot of a ship-of-war. We may be quite sure that he will have no thought of fighting, but rather of ""living to rob another day."" Our only hope is that he may rely too much upon the aid and assistance of our neutral friends, and may put his vessel into a spot where the Kearsarge or the Niagara may get a chance at her.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WILL THE FLORIDA GO TO EUROPE?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WILL THE FLORIDA GO TO EUROPE?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea345755-e348-5f67-9867-065672574bda,374,nyt://article/ea345755-e348-5f67-9867-065672574bda,

Wilson's Raid at Staunton Bridge--A Hint to Border Towns,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/21/archives/a-hint-to-the-border-towns.html,Wilson's Raid at Staunton Bridge--A Hint to Border Towns,"We would respectfully recommend to those citizens of Hagerstown, Frederick, Greencastle and Chambersburgh, who are annually plundered by rebel raids, the following instructive occurrence: Gen. WILSON recently led a corps of some six thousand cavalry on one of his destructive expeditions. His horsemen are among the bravest men of the national army, the terror of the rebels, and truly a formidable force. They swept on, harrying and destroying, till they reached the Staunton Bridge, near the Roanoke. If they had crossed this, almost the whole of North Carolina would have been open to them; or if they had burnt it, one of the most important links of rebel communication would have been destroyed. Even a delay there exposed them to the risk of capture on their return. The rebels had collected on the other side of the bridge some six hundred militia, and as many old soldiers, with three pieces of artillery. We had 6,000, with sixteen pieces. After some lively skirmishing, Gen. WILSON found that we could not carry the bridge by storm without considerable loss, and that an artillery fight would take too much time, so he was compelled to retreat. He could, indeed, have flanked the position, but that would have cost two days' time, and given the enemy a chance to concentrate in his rear. So three cannon and a few hundred men drove off this brave and active little army, and the delay brought our cavalry back, just so as to fall into the rebel trap at Ream's Station.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Hint to the Border Towns.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Hint to the Border Towns.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/29063453-19fa-5dd2-93d2-3948aed3d874,503,nyt://article/29063453-19fa-5dd2-93d2-3948aed3d874,

The hordes of these Alabama and Georgia men that used to come crowding within our lines in the Southwest in the days of POPE and ROSECRANS, we should have thought would have considerably thinned the rebel cohorts belonging to those States.

They are generally, as in the present instance, in search of something green, and no doubt they find it. The strange and the painful part of the business is that they come in these miraculous droves almost invariably when there is an immediate prospect of a great battle. They did so, we remember, before Murfreesboro; they did so before Chickamauga; and although they were fewer in number, the desertions which preceded the battles of Fredericksburgh and the Wilderness formed the subject of a pleasing prologue, before we received the reports of these battles themselves.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Desertions from the Enemy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Desertions from the Enemy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b4d9c02-3056-59e2-a17a-4b7f1740d1a8,479,nyt://article/4b4d9c02-3056-59e2-a17a-4b7f1740d1a8,

BRAGG has gone to Atlanta to exercise a personal supervision over the movements of the rebel army. This only is sufficient to remove all doubts as to the ultimate success of SHERMAN's operations. There are not many Generals to whom the Union cause is more deeply indebted than to Gen. BRAGG, and the assistance which he has rendered it is all the more creditable to him, as his sympathies must of course be altogether on the rebel side. No matter how this war may end, no true Unionist can ever forget the valuable cooperation which Gen. ROSECRANS received from, him in Tennessee, during the retreat from Murfreesboro; and it was, in fact, in no small degree to the masterly combinations of the Confederate leader that we got into Chattanooga without firing a shot. If we were indebted to him for no other service than this, the burden of our obligations would be great; but he did not stop here. Finding our army was in great straits at Chattanooga for supplies, he generously let us have Lookout Valley, and believing that LONGSTREET's presence on Missionary Ridge was probably embarrassing us, he dispatched that officious and turbulent personage to Knoxville, and left himself for Dalton, when requested to do so by Gen. GRANT. There has, in short, not been a single stage in this excellent man's career since this war began, in which he has not afforded us valuable facilities for the accomplishment of the great work which our armies have before them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Inevitable Bragg.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Inevitable Bragg.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0ebf5b61-1e40-568f-aea6-ee9b5f453599,400,nyt://article/0ebf5b61-1e40-568f-aea6-ee9b5f453599,

We know, with something approaching to certainty, that particular corps and particular divisions fought at South Mountain, at Antietam, and at Gettyshurgh, and upon these ascertained facts we have founded some approximate estimate of the number of men LEE brought over the river on each occasion, and of the number he took back. And these estimates must supply the place of reliable returns, until the Confederacy itself, with all its official arcana, is fairly turned inside out. For it has been from the very outset of the war a fundamental point in the military policy of DAVIS and LEE to deceive as to the actual rebel strength, wherever such deception was possible, either in great actions, or in what might be called such by-play as the late Northern incursion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Enemy's Concealment of His Strength."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Enemy's Concealment of His Strength."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e78f33f-7747-59af-8095-bfd9c4bfd0d6,564,nyt://article/7e78f33f-7747-59af-8095-bfd9c4bfd0d6,

The task which this body has before it is one of no ordinary magnitude and difficulty. It has to find a candidate that there is some chance of electing, and plan out a policy which will satisfy at least a majority of the members of the party; and the prospect opened up by the pressure of these obligations is by no means a pleasant one. The candidate has to be a well-known man of war, who is decidedly in favor of peace; a strong upholder and admirer of Slavery, who believes Slavery had better be abolished; a firm believer in the theory of secession, who believes that the practice of secession ought to be resisted at any cost; an opponent of the rebellion, who believes that the South is fully justified in rebelling; a firm supporter of the ""Constitution as it is,"" who does not blame JEFF. DAVIS for trying to overthrow it; a great admirer of the military and political ability of the Southern leaders, who is fully satisfied that the State militia furnishes the best army that can possibly be put into the field; an opponent of the Conscription Act, and of all volunteering for the war, who thinks our armies ought to be stronger; a good old-school Democrat, who thinks the humble origin of LINCOLN and JOHNSON a complete disqualification for either the Presidency or the Vice-Presidency; in short, a man who would like everything done differently, and yet is opposed to all change; who wants everything that he cannot get, and who, while agreeing with everybody, differs from all the rest of the world. The General Committee is anxiously engaged in searching for a gentleman possessing the above qualifications, and hope to find him in time for the convention.

"The Marion (Miss.,) Clarion gives a brief military biography of this officer, recently appointed Lieutenant-General. He is a native of South Carolina and a graduate of West Point, where he was honored with a diploma in 1854. He was a classmate of Gens. J.E.B. STUART, J.B. VILLEPIGUE, W.D. PENDER and HORACE RANDALL. After leaving West Point, he entered the regular service as Second Lieutenant or the Fourth Artillery, and was subsequently promoted First Lieutenant of the First Regiment of Regulars. Shortly after his native State, left the old Union, Gen. LEE resigned his position in the service of the United States, and repaired to South Carolina, where he entered the army of that State as Captain, early in March, 1861. He served with BEAUREGARD in the taking of Fort Sumter, and after the strife was fully inaugurated and a hostile army on the soil of the Old Dominion, he repaired to Virginia with a battery of light artillery, and there, with the legion of HAMPTON, figured conspicuously and honorably in many of the sanguinary engagements. He was soon honored with the rank of Major, next Lieutenant-Colonel and then Colonel. He commanded a battery on the Potomac for some time; was in the battle of Seven Pines and the seven days' fight around Richmond; was next assigned to duty as Colonel of the Fourth Virginia cavalry and subsequently to a battery of artillery that gained distinction in the second battle of Manassas and at Sharpsburgh. When a commander was needed for the defences of Vicksburgh in the Fall of 1862, President DAVIS sent him to defend the stronghold of Mississippi, having conferred upon him the rank of Brigadier-General. He commanded at the battle of Chickasaw Bayou, above Vicksburgh, where, in December, 1862, he whipped SHERMAN and MORGAN SMITH, who brought a large force against his heroic little band. At the battle of Baker's Creek he commanded a brigade of Georgians, and during the siege of Vicksburgh held that portion of STEVENSON's line so furiously assaulted on the 19th and 22d of May.

JOHNSTON's career seems to be nearly closed, we may say that he affords one of the best examples on record of a great military reputation based on nothing better than college success. JOHNSTON had never won a battle, or done anything else by which soldiers acquire reputation, when he was appointed to the command of the force that was to relieve Vicksburgh; and yet it was the universal opinion both North and South that he was an able officer, and was capable of great things. It is hardly possible that his march from PATTERSON's front, and timely arrival at Bull Run, or his conduct during the brief period he had command of the main rebel army on the Peninsula, two years ago, had anything to do with this. The only service he rendered the unfortunate PEMBERTON, at Vicksburgh, was to send him some concise lectures on the art of war, just when it was too late to profit by them. When BRAGG had manoeuvred ROSECRANS from Nashville into Chattanooga, JOHNSTON was put in his place, and was immediately invested with the same unbounded and utterly baseless confidence as before. The Southern people expected to hear every day that he had destroyed SHERMAN's army, without being able to assign a single reason for it, beyond the opinion formed of him by his comrades at college. It is to be hoped that by this time the public, both North and South, is beginning to be aware of the wide interval which separates the brilliant student from the successful soldier, the strategist of the closet from the strategist of the field, and to recognize the large share which the moral qualities have in making an able General.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gen.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/23/archives/american-topics-national-and-confederate-cruisers-alleged.html,,"The Federal war steamer Kearsarge arrived in Dover Roads on Wednesday evening. It had been stated in some of the French papers that a successor to the Alabama would probably be in waiting off Cherbourg when the Federal vessel left that port, and that another naval engagement might take place, in which the South would have an opportunity of retrieving its late defeat. No new Alabama, however, seems to have yet appeared; but it is asserted that a steamer, the Jeddo, which left Bordeaux on the 22d June, is to take the place of the notorious privateer. On this subject the Geronde of the 4th says: ""It will be recollected that a mystery surrounded the departure of the Jeddo. This mystery seems likely to be maintained. In fact it was Wednesday, the 22d June, that the Jeddo quitted our port for Amsterdam; the voyage between the two cities being ordinarily four days, we ought five days ago at least to have heard of the arrival in the Dutch port of the steamer built and armed by M. ARMAN. But no commercial journal that we know of has said a word on the subject. The voyage of the Jeddo has certainly something strange and unusual about it, and the future will soon show that the anticipations, respecting her were only too well founded."" The Opinion Nationale asserts that the vessel here referred to will soon reappear, fully armed and manned, and with the Confederate flag flying. Capt. SEMMES, it is said, is too ill to take the command of her. This duty will consequently devolve upon the first lieutenant of the late Alabama, whose appointment is expected to arrive about the middle of the present month. If the statements of the French papers are to be relied on, there will soon be no lack in the channel of war vessels belonging to the opposing Powers. According to those statements, the Florida is already there; the Jeddo, as we have seen, is being got ready; and ""the South is probably preparing a display of fresh forces;"" while on the other hand, we learn that the Federal steamer Niagara left Antwerp on the 2d instant, to cruise in the Channel, and that a new Federal steamer, the Macedonian, built upon the same model as the Kearsarge, and armed with heavy guns, is expected. The Presse thinks that a far more ""dramatic engagement than that in which the Alabama perished"" may accordingly be looked for at no distant date.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMERICAN TOPICS.; NATIONAL AND CONFEDERATE CRUISERS.

A Te Deum and Jubilate are to be sung, and the Most Rev. Dr. MCCLOSKEY will deliver his first archiepiscopal sermon. The ceremonies of installation, comprising one of the grandest of the rituals of the Roman Church, are of very rare occurrence.

This occurred at Chang-chow, the most important, after Nankin, of all the rebel strong, holds, and which GORDON, in conjunction with the mandarin forces, is besieging. When the Major arrived before this city, he found it invested on three sides by about 60,000 Imperialists, who had breached the wall in seven places, but not yet ventured on an assault. The Commander of the mercenaries at one determined to put an end to this state of if action by storming certain earthworks held by the rebels, outside the west gates. These were all carried by the 26th of April. Then batteries were planted to widen the breaches which the native artillerists had made, am on the morning of the 28th a general onset was ordered. But the assailants encountered so desperate a resistance that, after the fight had continued for half an hour with the utmost fury, they had to retire, with the loss of some 400 officers and men killed and wounded. Notwithstanding this disaster, however, nothing can avert the capture of Chang-chow, and the overthrow of the rebels, save the speedy recall of GORDON. The rigid enforcement of the British order may once more turn the tide of victory in favor of the Taepings, but if the Commander of the Anglo-Chinese legion be left at its head for a few months longer, the Empire of Tien-wang will have vanished. Already, indeed, it is tottering to its fall, Kiang-soo being the only province where the rebels retain a semblance of power, and even there, three of the four cities which yet remain to them are beleaguered.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Civil War in China.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Civil War in China.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c45a7dfd-cc2c-56cc-a3d6-fc8ab43f4ecd,946,nyt://article/c45a7dfd-cc2c-56cc-a3d6-fc8ab43f4ecd,

From the evidence taken, it appears that GRINLINTON and THOMAS DUMPHY, both employed on a United States gunboat in the Atlantic Dock basin, left work at the usual hour on the above evening to go home. They called into DEPPERHAN's saloon, in Imlay-street, and took a drink. They met MCGRATH there. A soldier with a musket came in, and a conversation arose as to different styles of military tactics. They had several drinks, and all became more or less influenced by liquor. DUMPHY, who had seen in the English army, got into position to show some style of tactics, when MCGRATH pushed him over, and made a motion to strike him, when GRINLINTON interposed, and there was no further trouble. MCGRATH and GRINLINTON got into a conversation about work, and the latter promised to see the foreman of the boiler-shop, with the view of securing him a job. Taking another drink they walked together through Imlay-street, will talking about tactics, when MCGRATH turned and struck DUMPHY in the face several times, and knocked him down. GRINLINTON asked him not to kill DUMPHY when he [???] med ""Yes, and you too."" When that he struck GRINLINTON a blow, knocking him down. GRINLINTON got up and was seen to make a move toward MCGRATH, and making a thrust upward, as if with a knife. MCGRATH cried that he was stubbed. He fell and was picked up by some neighbors, who carried him to his residence No. 3 Van Brunt-street. He died soon after the injury. GRINLINTON then left. DUMPHY went home before the last [???]ray, it having been shown that he was so much under the influence of liquor that he hardly knew what he was about. No explanation was given why MCGRATH struck DUMPHY. One witness testified that MCGRATH was going toward GRINLINTON, and the latter was backing away from him about the time injury was inflicted.

America, indeed, can count few men like Mr. MARSH -- at once a scholar and a stateman -- who combines active and contemplative pursuits in a manner that scarcely meets with a paralell in our biographical annals. He has always been a profound and observant student of men, books and things, confined to no nationalities, but ranging from his great philological acquirements, over the most obscure and least known literatures of Europe, while equally familiar with those of the classic nations, ancient and modern. Great natural powers of mind, cultivated and heightened by this breadth and depth of erudition, have entitled him to speak on almost every topic of enlightened inquiry with the authority of an original investigator and discoverer. Unfortunately for his cotemporaries -- and as is too often the case with men of this encyclopedic stamp -- the passion for acquiring knowledge is over-mastering, and scarcely checked for a moment by the minor duty of communicating it. The chance delivery of his lectures on ""Language,"" and on ""Early English Literature,"" and their publication, first revealed to the world what had been hitherto only known to a circle of private friends. They have been received, both at home and abroad, with acclamation, and now take permanent rank among the most learned and philosophical contributions to the study of the elder literature of England that the present age has produced. Be it always remembered, too, that this was not with the author a special or exclusive pursuit, such as a College Professor lectures on and ponders over for long series of years. They were written almost ""off hand,"" from a general fullness of thought and knowledge, and form a mere temporary episode in the life of a scholar, whose intellectual drag-net brings in turn all subjects of human or inanimate interest within his grasp. Somewhat similar in its relation to the writer is the volume before us. The first suggestion of the train of thought exemplified in ""Man and Nature,"" was due to observations made in his New England home. Foreign travel deepened these impressions, and intimacy with a whole class of books devoted to similar inquiries, (which probably no American or Englishmen shares with him,) has led to the production of a work that opens a branch of research at once novel, interesting and important to the wellfare of civilized man.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MAN AND NATURE.; MAN AND NATURE; or PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, AS MODIFIED BY HUMAN ACTION.

What is the object whose possession justifies such an expenditure of both offensive and defensive force, when either antagonist needs every man and every gun it can muster, in front of the Confederate Capital? In the first place, it is Atlanta itself -- a modern, well-built city, now approaching its twenty-first year, but still sooner to reach its freedom birthday. Laid out in a circular form, with a radius of about a mile, it contains within its strongly intrenched circumference (now that the war has brought an accretion of a fourth to its numbers,) a population of about twenty thousand souls. From its protected situation, deep in the interior of the Confederacy, it was chosen at the outset as a great military depot of supplies and of material of war, and, furthermore, as a great military workshop. In this respect it has no equal in the central zone of the Confederacy. It is the Richmond of the West. Here are arsenals, foundries, furnaces, rolling-mills, machine-shops, laboratories, factories, which have been busily supplying the Confederacy with munitions of war for the past three years. Here the finest and largest rolling-mill in the South has been turning out iron rails for roads, and armor-plating for iron-clads, the latter in great abundance. Here are factories for shot and shell, for pistols, powder, cartridges and percussion caps, for gun-carriages, for small arms, for equipments, wagons and harnesses, shoes and clothing, and for many other purposes useful to the rebel commissariat. Here also, are railroad repair-shops of incalculable value to the enemy. At least two thousand people keep this valuable machinery in operation. We, with our surplus Springfields and Lowells, do not appreciate how illy the enemy can spare this single city. As a depot of supplies, also, as well as a manufactory, Atlanta has played an important part. But doubtless most of its stores and its completed goods, have already been prudentially removed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What is the Military Value of Atlanta?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What is the Military Value of Atlanta?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Atlanta', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/029a0847-6406-534a-b045-f8aca1652ed8,1323,nyt://article/029a0847-6406-534a-b045-f8aca1652ed8,

From the investigations that have been made, we learn that JOHN JACKSON, who occupied rooms on the third floor of the premises, is the guilty person. He has of late been much addicted to drinking, and when in his fits of intoxication he has beaten his wife badly, and upon several occasions set fire to her wearing apparel. At a late hour on Sunday night he returned home, and finding his wife absent, be stated in the presence of BRIDGET CONNOR that he would destroy everything belonging to his wife, and then he would set fire to the building. Mrs. CONNOR looked through a window and saw JACKSON taking clothing, &c., from a closet, and at the same time heard him say, ""I'll make a fire."" Soon after, he went to her door, and inquired if she were awake, saying he was going to fire the house immediately, and she could get out if she wanted to. Mrs. CONNOR implored him not to do it, when he, in reply repeatedly said that he would soon put the building in flames. Shortly after this Mrs. CONNOR saw smoke and flame issuing from JACKSON's bedroom. An alarm was raised, and when the neighbors rushed to the scene they found JACKSON holding up linen and cotton wearing apparel, which he had already set on fire, and was trying to make it burn faster by exposing it to the air. The fire had already made considerable progress, when Roundsman BLAIR, of the Fourth Precinct, hearing the disturbance, went to the scene, and with the aid of some citizens, extinguished the flames. JACKSON was arrested and locked up, in default of $1,000 bail. It is said by Fire Marshal BAKER, who is engaged in making an investigation of the matter, that the prisoner has been but two or three months out of Sing Sing. Several of his neighbors are able to testify as to his acts of incendiarism, and also as to the brutality which from to time he has inflicted upon his family.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Bold Attempt to Burn Tenement House.

"A curious, and by no means [???]mimportant case of Sea Wages, was decided yesterday by the presiding magistrate at the Thames' Police Court. Capt. W.A. BELL, of the barque Resolution, appeared to summonses taken out by aine of the crew of that vessel, claiming sundry balances of wages alleged to have been earned on a voyage from New-York to Jamaica, and thence to London. The men signed articles for $35 per month per man, and they claimed to be paid at the rate of 4s. per dollar, the standard price of the American dollar in London. It appeared, however, that the ship's articles contained the words United States currency,"" which, being applied to the payment of the wages, would make the difference between 4s. and 2s. 7d. the dollar, or between &#163;7 and &#163;4 10s. 5d. per month. A. question was raised as to whether this this proviso was inserted in the articles when they were signed by the crew. The magistrate held that it was, and that the men were bound by it, and could only claim payment of their wages according to the present value of the American dollar in New-York. In decl[???]ing that the intention of the agreement was, that the men should be paid in United States currency -- that is according to the current value of the dollar in America -- we have no doubt the magistrate was right; but should the payment be made according to the value of the dollar at the time the articles were signed or at the time the voyage was concluded Greenbacks, no doubt, as the magistrate observed, are current in America, as bank notes are here, but, unfortunately, they are liable to be occasionally at a discount, and the prolongation of the war has no had the tendency to increase their value. When the crew of the Resolution signed articles, therefore, at New-York, the value of the currency in which it was [???]pulated they should be pa[???] was considerably in excess of what it is now, and if the men were to be held to the strict letter of their agreement, they were entitled at least to the full benefit of its conditions. The difference of four months and six days, the period over which the voyage extended, makes, in the present state of affairs in America, a very great change in the value of every description of security in that country, and although greenbacks are a legal tender in America, and the Master of the Resolution had an admitted right to pay the crew's wages in that currency, the men, on their part, had an equal right to claim payment at the rate current when the agreement was entered into. The decision to this ease is important, because it shows the determination of the bench to be governed by the express meaning and letter of the agreement. It would have been most unjust to the Master of the Resolution or his employers to have denied him the benefit of an express supalation introduced into the articles, and which, it appears, the crew were cognisant of, and quite understood. On the other hand, as the proviso was applied literally and exactly, the men, as it seems to us, were entitle to claim their wages in the currency of the day when the articles were signed, if they thought proper to do so, The point, however, does not appear to have been raised on the part of the claimants, who have taken their wages at the current rate, namely at 2s, 7d. per dollar.

Composition of Objected to,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/26/archives/general-city-news.html,Composition of Objected to,"THE SPINOLA COURT-MARTIAL. -- Yesterday morning, the Court-martial appointed to try the case of Gen. SPINOLA, assembled at No. 17 State-street. Gen. PECK being absent, Gen. HAETSUFF presided. Gen. SPINOLA was present with his counsel. The detail, and Gen. DIX's order premulgating the same, were read by the Judge-Advocate, after which Gen. SPINOLA read a lengthy paper in which he protested against the composition and constitution of the court. He claimed that, as Gen. Dix was his accuser, his selection of the members of the court was not authorized, but was in violation of the principles of justice and the rules of law. An accuser could not designate the members of a court to try an accused. He further objected to the court on the ground that it should be composed of officers of his own grade, when they could be procured; and he contended that there were many such officers within reach of the Government not otherwise employed. In support of these objections he cited the act of Congress passed in 1861 relative to court-martials, and the 75th and 64th Articles of War. The paper being handed to the Judge-Advocate, the court was cleared for deliberation. Upon the reopening, the Judge-Advocate notified the reporters that an order had been made on the minutes that no part of the proceeding should be published. The members of the press then left. The Court finally adjourned to this morning at 11 o'clock.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c089e124-03b1-528d-b035-5096ce5c57b5,362,nyt://article/c089e124-03b1-528d-b035-5096ce5c57b5,

Brady's Photographs from the Seat of War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/26/archives/bradys-photographs-from-the-seat-of-war.html,Brady's Photographs from the Seat of War,"The war which we are waging for our national existence is, in its attendant circumstances, as well as in its origin and its vastness, unlike any other known to history. One of its peculiarities is the copiousness of its contemporary records -- records not made from hearsay or inference, but by correspondents and combatants who actually saw that of which they write. Not the least interesting of these contemporary memorials of our great struggle are the photographs ""from the front,"" which the eminent photographer, Mr. BRADY, brings back from, expeditions which carry him so far into the hurly-burly of the fight that they are only not military because he is not armed save with his camera. The fruits of his last visit to the seat of war in Virginia, made immediately after taking his remarkable series of views of the Metropolitan Fair which now adorn his gallery, are perhaps the most interesting of all that we owe to his enterprise, his taste and skill, and which he has now on exhibition and for sale. Among these some of the most noteworthy are, ""The Great Pontoon Fridge,"" by which the Army of the Potomac passed the James River -- the longest ever made and thrown over the deepest water ever thus spanned; a view of ""Belle Plain,"" a charming subject, worthy of KENSETT's pencil; the ""Burial Place at Fredericksburg,"" where shrouded heroes lie prepared for their long sleep beneath the sod; ""A Group of Wounded Men,"" at the same place; they sit upon the grass and talk cheerily together; views of ""Port Royal and City Point;"" a glimpse of ""Burnside's Corps"" in motion; ""Rebel Prisoners at White House"" -- a multitudinous and motley group; the ""Battle-field at Fredericksburgh;"" ""COOPER'S First Pennsylvania Battery,"" and ""Gen. POTTER and his Staff,"" both of which were taken under fire; in examining which the inexperienced observer will be surprised to see how quietly fighting men carry themselves under such circumstances. These photographs have one advantage ever many of a similar kind which come from abroad, in that, while they are sharp and clear, most of them are not too large to be placed in albums and portfolios that can lie upon the parlor table.

It seems that on Friday the rebels assaulted our lines with great impetuosity, striking the right, which was held by the Fifteenth Corps, under Gen. BLAIR. This corps held its ground firmly until the Sixteenth Corps, under Gen. DODGE, came up, when the enemy were repulsed with very heavy loss. Gen. LOGAN, with the Seventeenth Corps, was also engaged. These three corps constitute the Army of the Tennessee, under MCPHERSON, and the news of the death of their Commander having been communicated to the men before they went into battle, they fought with great desperation, their battle-cry being ""Remember MCPHERSON!"" Gen. MCPHERSON, it seems, was killed by a rebel sharpshooter from an ambush, while he was making a personal reconnoissance of his lines, before the battle. The dispatches to the Government represent that the struggle ended by the repulse of the enemy along the entire line. It was arranged that on Saturday the dead of both armies should be buried, and the wounded removed under a flag of truce. Our troops buried one thousand rebels left on the field within our line; besides which the rebels buried many of their own dead themselves near their works. Our loss will reach about 2,500 in killed and wounded. It is reported, though it would seem to be inconsistent with flag-of-truce operations, about which there must be some misapprehension, that while the work of burying the dead and removing the wounded was going on on Saturday, SHERMAN's heavy artillery was playing upon the city. At the same time large fires were observed in different parts of Atlanta, supposed to be caused by the destruction of supply depots and other rebel property, which the enemy could not carry off, and did not wish to fall into our hands. Several rebel Generals are reported to be killed, but their names are not yet given.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f3d1f386-5e69-531c-aad7-e861ffdc4c3b,424,nyt://article/f3d1f386-5e69-531c-aad7-e861ffdc4c3b,

The law in relation to joint captures, for instance, is modified in this way: The law of July 17, 1862, provided that ""when one or more vessels of the navy shall be within signal distance of another making a prize, all shall share in the prize."" The present law provides that ""all vessels of the navy within signal distance of the vessel or vessels making the capture, under such circumstances and in such condition as to be able to render effective aid, if required, shall share in the prize."" There may be a question, perhaps, whether the former provision is so inconsistent with this as to be repealed, and if not, whether a vessel within signal distance would not be entitled to share, although not able to render any effective aid in the capture. The new limitation was doubtless intended to be made general, and if it applies, it leaves open for many cases a very interesting discussion as to what shall constitute the power to give effective aid.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Changes in the Prize Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Changes in the Prize Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/256790f2-ba51-572a-afb5-21cace3b6018,575,nyt://article/256790f2-ba51-572a-afb5-21cace3b6018,

Movement; real drift of seen,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/27/archives/beginning-to-see-it.html,Movement; real drift of seen,"-- Some of the most prominent and influential actors in the Fremont movement are beginning to see its real meaning and drift. From the very outset it has been perfectly evident that there was nothing of principle in it, but that its object was simple personal and political revenge. FREMONT himself openly proclaimed his determination to aid in defeating LINCOLN by all the means in his power; he would accept a nomination himself, if necessary, to accomplish that object. This was the spirit of the whole movement. Every man hitherto a supporter of the Administration, or an advocate of its principles, who had suffered personal disappointments, whose advice had not been followed, or whose views of policy had not been adopted, availed himself of that occasion to seek his revenge. FREMONT, in his letter of acceptance, made a very bold and shameless confession of the spirit and motive which prompted the movement and gave it all its strength.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEGINNING TO SEE IT!', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BEGINNING TO SEE IT!', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7c73fe45-5b74-57b1-b5e8-a0f9c23d2560,331,nyt://article/7c73fe45-5b74-57b1-b5e8-a0f9c23d2560,

He proceeded to state his views, however, holding in substance that the act of Congress did not give a discharge in cases where the Grand Jury had no jurisdiction to take action; that these parties, as appeared by the papers and the admissions of counsel on the argument, were held by the military authorities for trial before military tribunals, and that the civil courts could not interfere to take them out of the jurisdiction of the military tribunals, any more than they could take them out of the custody of criminal tribunals, the country being in a state of flagrant rebellion, and the suspension of the habeas corpus having established martial law. He, therefore, denied all the applications. In Allen's case the papers had not been laid before him, and he therefore rendered no decision.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; The Fort Lafayette Prisoners Their Discharge Refused.UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JULY 26.Before Judge Betts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LAW REPORTS.; The Fort Lafayette Prisoners Their Discharge Refused.UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JULY 26.Before Judge Betts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b01e8aef-9d45-5c7f-8023-490f54f7eb43,296,nyt://article/b01e8aef-9d45-5c7f-8023-490f54f7eb43,

"This gallant young officer, the report of whose death on the field of battle is not fully confirm, graduated with honor from West Point in 1853. At the outbreak of the rebellion he was First-Lieutennant in the Regular cavalry, belonging, we believe, to the Mounted Rifles -- a regiment then stationed in New-Mexico, and largely officered by men of Southern proclivities. When the troubles first became serious in the region of northern Texas and in Arkansas, Lieut. AVERILL was selected for the very hazardous work of journeying from New-Mexico by the route through northern Texas to Fort Smith, in Arkansas, and thence to Washington, with highly important information to the Government. This he did, and then returned as successfully as he had come. Subsequently he came back again, and was commissioned Colonel of Volunteers, in which capacity he raised the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, and went through the entire Peninsula campaign under Gen. MCCLELLAN, serving with much ability in those days of an inefficient and lembryotic cavlary force. For this service he was made Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and remained with the Army of the Potomac, commanding a brigade of cavalry under Gen. STONEMAN, and when Gen. HOOKER consolidated the force into one corps, Gen. AVERILL received the command of a division, which he retained until about the 1st of June, 1863. Gen. AVERILL fought the first considerable cavalry engagement of the war, that of Kelly's Ford, March 17, 1863, where the Rappahannock River was crossed in the face of the enemy, and FITZ LEE's cavalry division forced back five miles. His loss here was nearly three hundred, and there had previously been no exclusively cavalry fights, where the loss reached a total of one hundred. Subsequently, in the Chancellorsville campaign, Gen. AVERILL took a prominent part, capturing Cul-pepper, and penetrating to the south bank of the Rapidan, In June, 1863, he was assigned to the command of all the cavalry forces in western Virginia. In this field he was eminently successful, securing the entire tranquility of that previously turbulent region. On the 8th of December, 1863, he started on his famous expedition to out the Virginia and East Tennessse Railroad, which was accomplished at Salem, on the 10th, and an immense amount of rebel supplies were destroyed. This is the first time this road was ever severed, and Gen. AVERILL's laconic sport to Gen. HALLECK, that he had ""rode, swam and slid three hundred and fifty miles,"" will long be remembered. Gen. AVERILL has also participated in all the later operations in that valley, including the recent expedition of Gen. HUNTER upon Lynchburgh, in which he had command of one of the cavalry columns, the other being under Gen. CROOK. Gen. AVERILL was very active -- always in the saddle, brave, cool, of excellent judgment, and serving always with the strictest fidelity. He was very young, not over 27, and if he has fallen, the country may rest assured that the gallant young officer was rallying his columns in a charge against the enemy.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/28/archives/obituary-briggen-william-m-averill.html,,"This gallant young officer, the report of whose death on the field of battle is not fully confirm, graduated with honor from West Point in 1853.

The result of the opening was surprising, although not wholly unexpected. Of the sum bid for, $410,000 were at par, and the balance of $348,000 at premium rates of from 101.03 to 6 per cent. The introduction of the new ""seven-thirties"" to the public by Secretary FESSENDEN, fully accounts for the failure of an entire disposition of the County Loan. At the time it was put upon the market for bids, it was likely to be taken at good premium rates, long-time loans being highly desirable. The result is something of a poser to Comptroller BRENDAN, who is undecided whether to accept the par bids or not. He could, no doubt, get good premium rates by re-advertising all of the loan not bid for at less than 2 per cent., by increasing the interest to 7 per cent., but this he would not wish to do, having heretofore rigidly insisted upon not paying over 6 per cent. Indeed, neither the City or County have paid 7 per cent. interest in years, except on the Union Defence Fund Bonds and the first Family Aid Fund loan. Mr. BRENNAN may be able to decline the par bids by inducing reinvestments in the loan by the old bondholders, or he may decide to wait till the attraction of the ""seven-thirties"" wanes, and meanwhile use money from other available sources to pay off the matured bonds.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4049625-a460-5748-a2cb-43c169736fd3,1105,nyt://article/a4049625-a460-5748-a2cb-43c169736fd3,

"Russell, W. H., on the War Situation",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/28/archives/russell-on-the-situation-trade-on-the-mississippi-incidents-of-the.html,"Russell, W. H., on the War Situation","Lieut.-Gen. ULYSSES GRANT seems to us to be in what he would most probably term, in his own nervous diction, ""a very tight place."" It is quite true that in his present position he must give much anxiety to the enemy, and that he menaces the Confederate capital with a greater danger than any the tenacious and valiant Southerners have yet had to encounter from Federal foes; but it is scarcely possible that he can retain that position under the fire of the July and August sun, and as vet any attempt to improve it by advancing has not been attended with encouraging results. As a line is length without breadth, and as a circle is bounded by a line, Gen. GRANT may maintain that he has not departed from his pledge to fight out the possession of Richmond ""on this line"" by moving round the Capital, but it is difficult to perceive what advantage he has trained by approaching it now from the south side it he fails in his purpose of cutting the Confederate communications. That the combination on which he relied for that purpose has signally failed cannot be doubted. HUNTER may have done damage to the western lines, but he has suffered dearly for his interference, and the injury was speedily repaired. The cavalry, in which the Federals seem to have established a decided preponderance, have failed to effect permanent destruction; and an attempt made by an expedition, under WILSON, to break up the line between Richmond via Petersburgh and Weldon, must have ended badly if it be true that the Confederates intercepted the horsemen and forced MEADE to march a whole corps and a division to their assistance, with results yet unknown to us. SHERIDAN, from whom a good deal was expected, has not turned out to be a ZEIDLITZ, a MURAT, or even a PAGET. He failed in a very feeble endeavor to reach HUNTER, and he has since lost, we are told, upwards of 1,000 men in a scamper across the Peninsula, south of Richmond, with the view of getting his corps across the James River to aid the cavalry force belonging to GRANT's army. The next great Federal army on which the hopes of the North have so long been fixed promises to become a source of fearful anxiety. SHERMAN, if not retreating, is certainly not advancing; and, if the Confederates can interfere seriously with his communications, he must fall back as soon as he has eaten up all the supplies of the district. At Charleston all is quiet, and Mobile has ceased to care for FARRAGUT's flotilla. The blockade cannot keep out arms, supplies and special correspondents, or keep in cotton in the South. On every point of the ragged circle which the Federals seek to penetrate they are encountered by skillful, resolute and successful opponents. All the enormous advantages possessed by the Federals have been nullified by want of skill, by the interference of Washington civilians, and by the absence of an animating homogeneous spirit on the part of their soldiery. Some fight for pay, others because they can't help it; some fight for the Union, others for abolition; some for confiscated land, others because they dislike a slave owning aristocracy. Every Southerner fights because, conscript though he be, he hates his enemy, and is striking for the principle of States rights, which converts the land of his birthplace into a fatherland for him against all the world. Who can be a native of a Union? A native of Georgia or Virginia has something tangible to point to when he is asked where is his country. If the Union were destroyed formally to-morrow -- as we believe it has been practically long ago -- the man of Maine or Ohio could go back to his home, not much damaged in any way, except in a certain windy pride, and in the happiness derived from the contemplation of excessive size, which rendered him a disagreeable companion to the rest of the world. New-York, indeed, would lose some trade, and tariffs would be modified in some States, but there the mischief would cease. Far otherwise would it be with Georgia or Virginia; if the South were crushed he would become an outcast, a pariah, the scorn of bitter enemies. Therefore the Southerners light to the death against the invading revolutionary North and all their hordes, sustained by such a spirit as would have animated the people of England had the First Consul thrown himself on their shores at the head of a Republican and Jacobin army That, all things considered, the North had the elements of military superiority to such an extent as justified an impartial observer in predicting they would obtain possession of the principal strategic points, the ports, arsenals, large cities, railway termini, and rivers in the South, cannot reasonably be denied. It is true they are very far from the attainment of their object now, after all their losses in money and in men; nor does it look as if GRANT were going to achieve it. Even if Richmond fell the South would fight long and desperately. But Petersburgh bars the way and GRANT is still sitting in front of the Confederate carthwoiks, whittling slicks, as is his wont, filling the hospitals with the living, and fattening the rank soil with his dead.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RUSSELL ON THE SITUATION.; Trade on the Mississippi.

Go into the smallest German hamlet, and you will find the inhabitants combined into one or more societies or clubs, each of which has in view some pleasant social object. You will find the drinking club a quiet, orderly, sober organization, generally composed of the middle-aged men of the community, with the pastor or village burgomaster at the head. Every evening, after the labor of the day has ended, they wend their way to the village inn, where in Summer they gather under the shade of trees or arbors, and in Winter in a neatly sanded bar-room. There they talk, about the news of the day, retail the gossip of the place, and sometimes, under the lead of the pastor, discuss the deepest themes of theological lore. At an early hour, fixed by law in nearly all the towns and cities, they break up, and return home as sober as they came. Then there are the musical clubs -- there is probably not a town in Germany that has not a musical club -- to which the young people belong, and which, too, always meet in the vicinity of a good beer-house. There is something sensible in the way the Germans set about enjoying themselves. They have been called a ""nation of thinkers and philosophers;"" but they have a practical instinct that esthetic pleasures never set well on an empty stomach. An evening concert in the open air or in a beer saloon, without the accompaniments of eating and drinking, would be a cheerless affair in Germany; and even at the theatres in Munich, ice cream and cake are handed round between the acts.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GERMAN GAMES.; Seventh Annual Festival of the New-York Schueizen Corps.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GERMAN GAMES.; Seventh Annual Festival of the New-York Schueizen Corps.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cead1d5c-341e-5360-a509-eae462120e63,1215,nyt://article/cead1d5c-341e-5360-a509-eae462120e63,

A servant on the premises discovered the thieves just as they were in the act of leaving. She pursued them and gave the alarm. Officer STILWELL, who was patroling in that neighborhood, heard her cries of ""Stop thief,"" and immediately gave chase. BEAL was followed to an unoccupied cellar, where he was found by the Officer secreted among some empty barrels. The cellar was searched, and the watch and chain found under some straw. One hundred dollars of the stolen money were found on the sidewalk, nearly opposite the cellar. CHRISTY was soon after secured by Officer BOOKSTAVER, of the Fifteenth Precinct. The prisoners were both taken before Justice DODGE at Jefferson Market, and, after an examination, were committed without bail.

One of the prominent Liberal Ministers -- the Provincial Secretary in the Coalition Cabinet -- has been defeated at the polls. His discomfiture will be laid at the doors of the Conservative electors; and the entente cordiale between the parties in the Executive Council is likely to be seriously impaired. Mr. GEORGE BROWN, the prime mover in the new arrangements, indeed, declared before this untoward election came off, that the rejection of the Provincial Secretary by his constituency would be almost a fatal blow at the coalition.

POLK's Funeral,"" it gives some interesting remarks. These consist of a malediction upon the Northern people and the Union army. Following this is a letter to the Mobile Register, which rings all the changes in praise of FORREST, and denunciation of our colored soldiers, whom it styles ""brutal negroes,"" and accuses the ""Federal Government"" of forcing them ""to murder white men and ravish white women."" This letter closes with a half expressed wish for the appearance of yellow fever. The batch of ""Late Southern News,"" closes with the following. ""The Columbus South Carolinian says it is stated on semi-official authority that the Hon. JOHN A. CAMPBELL, of Alabama, formerly one of the Supreme Bench of the old United States, and since the war Assistant Secretary of War, will, in all probability, be appointed as the successor of Mr. MEMMINGER, it being regarded as certain that the latter will resign.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/672886ac-e27c-5ec0-ba44-57af313b5f76,856,nyt://article/672886ac-e27c-5ec0-ba44-57af313b5f76,

Rockland Female Institute Commencement,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/30/archives/commencement-at-rockland-female-institute.html,Rockland Female Institute Commencement,"Wednesday was a gala day at Nyack, the Commencement of the Rockland Female Institute drawing a crowd of residents and strangers -- a customary annual and brilliant occasion memorable in the region roundabout. After the steamboats and cars had landed their visitors -- pilgrims from the city enjoying a day's breath in the country, as well as a literary treat -- the stream of pedestrians and carriage-riders added a new picturesqueness to a picturesque village. The audience was crowded and brilliant, the music admirable and the graduating exercises spirited and successful. The programme divided the day into a morning and an evening meeting. In the morning the graduating classes, consisting of seven young ladies, tastefully dressed in white, delivered their essays, many of which were remarkable for excellence of thought and skill of expression. The salutatory was by Miss Josephine Leonard, of Rockland Lake; subject -- ""Life, not Years, but Action;"" Miss Susie B. M'Graw, of New-York City, followed on ""The Spirit of the Nineteenth Century.""Miss Anna J. Benneson, of Quincy, Ill., ""Round the World at Sunset;"" Miss Alice A. Benneson, ""Silent Lives;"" Miss Alice G. Price, Elizabeth, N.J., ""Acting;"" Miss Kate A. Nichols, Nyack, ""Hawthorne and Thackeray."" The valedictory -- appropriate and touching -- was by Miss CASSIE LEONARD, of Rockland Lake. In the presentation of the diplomas, Rev. L.D. MANSFIELD, Senior Principal, made a fit and touching address to the young ladies, drawing tears from many eyes. The farewell hymn of the graduates, words by Miss LOUISA B. HENDRICKSON, and music by Prof. VAN OECKELEN, was the closing exercise of the morning.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Commencement at Rockland Female Institute.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Commencement at Rockland Female Institute.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6cd68eff-97fe-5ae5-985c-2c8d61baa175,446,nyt://article/6cd68eff-97fe-5ae5-985c-2c8d61baa175,

That there are thousands of men in nearly every loyal State who would readily join any secret organization calculated to bring the war to a close, is certain. That there are politicians malignant and desperate enough to engineer, if possible, such an organization into positive resistance to the National Government and overt treason, is just as undeniable. But that all this has been actually going on, for months, both through the West and the East, so that now the numerical strength of the Order is ""over half a million,"" embracing many of the leading men of the party opposed to the Administration, is utterly improbable. The Provost-Marshal-General of the Department of Missouri, we dare say, is a very sharp fellow, but it don't follow that every other loyal man is an idiot. Likely enough he has ""been taking testimony for months,"" but other people have not been all that time napping. We think that plenty of eyes and ears beside his own have been open, and that had this traitorous work been carried on to anything like the extent represented, somebody else would have got wind of it too.

Magazines for August,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/30/archives/the-magazines.html,Magazines for August,"-- Harpers' New Monthly Magazine, (NewYork, HARPER BROS.,) has secured a potentally in CHARLES DICKENS, whose current story, ""Our Mutual Friend,""reaches the New World through its pages. The present number for August, contains the third monthly installment, and displays the author's usual characteristics. The plot is, as yet, scarcely devoloped, and the interest depends, not on incident, but on the display of character and humorous description. Unfortunately, DICKENS seems to think it necessary, perhaps on the principle of contrast, to sandwich his high and low life scenes, offering alternately a slice of one and of the other, in each number. In one range he is supreme; in the other just as feeble. All the graphic reality and genuine humor displayed in Mr. Boffin and his friends, which have the force of actual transcripts from humanity, give place to a shadowy, would-be sarcastic, sketchy, style of treatment, where nothing is so conspicuous as the author's inaptitude for his theme when he touches on fashionable follies. In the hard-worked Curate and his wife, we have a study of her character, for DICKENS, showing how many veins yet remain unworked in the world of London, where his strength chiefly lies. The conclusion of THACKERAY's ""Denis Duval,"" and of Miss MULOCH's ""Unkind Word,"" are the other most important articles of fiction. The Editor, Dr. GUERNSEY, furnishes an analysis, copiously Illustrated, of READE's flippant book on Western Africa.

DEVLIN & Co., doing business at Nos. 459 and 461 Broadway, extensive dealers in clothing, has missed large quantities of goods in so mysterious a manner as to cause the proprietors of the establishment to take active measures to ferret out the guilty persons, and to recover the lost goods. Application was made to JOHN S. YOUNG, Chief of the Detective Force, a few weeks since, and officers RADFORD and KELSO were detailed to work up the case, and, if possible, secure the thieves and the property. The officers above named immediately commenced a system of espionage which is known only to New-York detectives. They worked long and vigilantly. They set a close watch over all the clerks in the establishment, and when it is remembered that there are over one hundred clerks in that establishment, it will be seen that the task was not an easy one. Day after day men in citizens' dress walked through that extensive store, and yet, with all their watchfulness, they for a time were unable to detect the culprit. Meantime the proprietors almost every day missed quantities of valuable clothing, Coats, vests and pantaloons disappeared in an unaccountable manner. As a general thing the goods taken were of the finest and most expensive character, and on some days properly to the amount of $100 was taken. After long and tedious watching and waiting, the detectives, Messrs. RADFORD and KELSO, came to the conclusion that there was only one thief in the business, and that he was an employe in the store REUBEN DECKER, a clerk of Messrs. DEVLIN & Co., was the person suspected. He was accordingly arrested. He was caught in the act of selling a new suit of clothes, which he had taken from DEVLIN's store to a couple of Frenchmen named PETER MAROCIER and JOHN DAGLO, whom he met at a lager-beer saloon, in Broome-street. The Frenchmen, as well as DECKER, were taken into custody.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Extensive Robberies in a Broadway Clothing Store.; A CLERK AND TWO RECEIVERS ARRESTED ON SUSPICION SOME OF THE PROPERTY RECOVERED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Extensive Robberies in a Broadway Clothing Store.; A CLERK AND TWO RECEIVERS ARRESTED ON SUSPICION SOME OF THE PROPERTY RECOVERED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-07-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/33e16056-524c-5599-a0ae-964dc6e61a86,484,nyt://article/33e16056-524c-5599-a0ae-964dc6e61a86,

"-Late on Sunday evening, a policeman brought to the Central Police Telegraph Station a bright little boy of about two years of age. He had been found in South Front-street, where a lady, instead of sending him to the nearest station-house, or leaving word that she had him, had kept him until the officer took charge and removed him to the Central Office. There had been inquirers during the day from the Third Ward for the child, and when he was brought in, word was immediately sent to the parents. The child fell asleep in the station-house, on the lounge. Shortly before 12 o'clock, a woman entered and inquired for a child, and the moment she saw the little fellow she claimed him as her own, and commenced a series of lamentations and endearments in true motherly style. But the operators at the telegraph station are very careful in regard to the release of children, and, perhaps, without any clear idea that the woman was an imposter, commenced questioning her as to the time and place the child was lost. Her answers soon established that she knew nothing about the child, and the operators at once charged her with being an imposter, to which she gave the most vehement denial. They refused to allow her to depart, and a few minutes after 12 o'clock the father entered and claimed his boy. He disclaimed all knowledge of the woman, although she insisted that he knew her.

Lastly, on the 1st of February, in this year, the Minister of Public Works addressed a circular to the French Companies, the directions of which are, we presume, founded upon the inquiries of the Commission.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FRENCH RAILWAY MANAGEMENT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FRENCH RAILWAY MANAGEMENT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-07-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c929d04-8a32-515d-9bd8-368fb25d5987,837,nyt://article/4c929d04-8a32-515d-9bd8-368fb25d5987,
"A case was commenced in the Chancery Court, York, on Thursday, and concluded yesterday, involving a serious charge against a clergyman of the Church of England. The promoter was Mr. T.S. NOBLE, and the suit was instituted against Rev. G.A. COCKBURN, Vicar of Pickering. Dr. TRISTRAM and Mr. MAULE, who wore specials retained, were advocates for the promoter, and Mr. SHEPHERD was the advocate for the defendant. The proceedings had been commenced in this court by virtue of letters of request from the Archbishop, presented under the authority of the Church Discipline Act. On the 16th of September last the defendant had been cited to answer certain articles charging him with having, within two years past, acted toward a female known by the name of JENNY WARDELL, with an unbecoming familiarity and in an indecent manner, thereby causing great scandal to the Church, and also with having committed adultery with the said JENNY WARDELL. who is between 20 and 30 years of age. In March, 1858, the defendant was instituted to the vicarage of the parish church of Pickering, and JENNY WARDELL had resided in the market-place of that town. The articles, twenty in number, alleged that on the 19th of June, 1862, the defendant was for some time alone with JENNY WARDELL in the kitchen of the house, and put his arms round her waist, and repeatedly kissed her. That, on the 21st of October in the same year, the Pickering Rifle corps attendee battalion drill at Scarbro', where the defendant met her, and after the drill he entered the railway station with her, deporting himself toward her with great familiarity and levity, and that he traveled in the same carriage with her between Malton and Pickering. That, in December, 1862, the defendant took, or attempted to take, an indecent liberty with JENNY WARDELL whilst she was standing on some steps in the church, at Pickering, engaged in decorating the chandelier. That, in November or December, 1862, he went into JENNY WARDELL bedroom whist she was in bed, and remained with her alone for a considerable time. That on four nights in July, 1863, she entered the private garden attached to the vicarage house, and that the defendant, who remained with her alone there for a considerable period. It was also alleged that on several occasions in 1862 and 1863. the defendant was in her house with her alone for long periods; that several of his parishioners had expressed openly and in his hearing, strong disapprobation; that since September, 1863, the defendant has been carrying on an [???] intercourse with JENNY WARDELL., and that the average attendance at the Sunday morning's service, by reason of the defendant's conduct has not during the past years exceeded fifty persons, whereas the congregation had previously [???] to five hundred. The twentieth article contained a prayer that the defendant be ca[???]ly and duly corrected and punished, having regard to the fact that the living of PICKERING is [???] sequestration, and also be condemned in costs. The defense of Mr. COCKBURN was in effect a total denial of the whole of the charges, and an allegation that they had been brought maliciously by his enemies. The hearing of the case occupied the court the whole of Thursday and yesterday, when the Chancellor gave judgment. The Chancellor said: Scandal was a fair ground for action against a clergyman who might have been guilty of habitual insurrection and indifference of opinion to his flock. What did the ordination services dictate but that a clergyman should frame and fashion his family, as much as in him it lay, [???] as to become wholesome examples and patterns to the flock of Christ? As to the defendant, he said that there was the gravest [???]cion that [???] familiarities had been brought home to him by [???]qute proof of most of the articles, and after a [???] warning which had been given by the archdeacon. Had the charge of adultery been brought home to him, he should have felt is this duty to have altogether deprived the defendant, whose conduct be could only say was suggestive of infatuation. He then spoke of the fair manner in which the case had been conducted, and briefly reviewed some of the strongest features of the evidence which had been tendered, and particularly that where it had been shown that the interview after the [???] warning took place in the rector's garden. There was not the s[???] pretence of business or official duty, he observed, proved to have been promotive of the intercourse which took place. As to the lady, he [???] she had not given way to the defendant's [???], and he had no reason to say that which would impeach her virtue; but there were the gravest reasons to impute indiscretion He trusted she would learn nothing worse at [???] than she had learned at Pickering. Under all the circumstances, and looking at his responsibilities, he had been led to hesitate whether, under any circumstances. he should be justified in allowing the defendant to resume his ministerial functions. But as a matter of comparative severity, and looking at the ordinary rules by which courts or justice had been guided, and the hope he entertained that a person after serious punishment, and with more time for consideration, might reflect on the evil which he had done, and turn over a new leaf and make himself more useful in the future than he had done in the past, he should content himself with the hope that it would prove a serious warning, and sentence the defendant to five years' suspension, and condemn him in costs, Notice of appeal was given.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/31/archives/scandal-in-english-high-life-a-church-scandal-in-yorkshire.html,,"A case was commenced in the Chancery Court, York, on Thursday, and concluded yesterday, involving a serious charge against a clergyman of the Church of England.

On descending the shaft, the first feature that strikes one with astonishment, is the solidity and finish of the masonry. At the entrance there is an immense iron cylinder, nine feet in diameter, extending downwards thirty feet. The remaining portion of the shaft to the bottom, seventy-eight feet below the surface, is built round with brick -- so finely finished in the building that it seems almost equally smooth around the sides with the cylinder.

Europe has forced forth her people to colonize America, and for the same reason which moved the Goths and Huns -- to better their condition. In fact, scarcely any people would leave their homes to find new ones, but for the strongest of motives. In some cases persecution has driven them forth, as when Holland, England and Germany received the best of the French artisans and manufacturers on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. In general, however, the pressing sense of physical wants, the instinct to provide better for themselves, has caused the movement of the greater number of emigrants. This is particularly the case with the people of Ireland, especially when the potato disease reduced the supply of food below the actual demand. Emigration from Ireland was quite large before this, but since the famine year of 1847-8 the migration from Ireland, especially to the United States, has been enormous. The population of Ireland has been reduced two and a half millions, who have left that island merely because they were cramped and furnished by the impossibility of supporting eight millions of people (which Ireland at one time had) in good and comfortable condition, on a space less than half the surface of Ohio. They were compelled to seek food and a better condition. The migration still continues, and the British Government has the folly to think that our Government is seducing them here to become soldiers.

"Since the party  fight over the Danes and Germans in both Houses of the British Parliament, the ferocious excitement of the nation over the wrongs of Denmark has died away as effectually as if everything had been set to rights with that unfortunate country.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/07/31/archives/a-philosophic-community.html,,"-- Since the party fight over the Danes and Germans in both Houses of the British Parliament, the ferocious excitement of the nation over the wrongs of Denmark has died away as effectually as if everything had been set to rights with that unfortunate country. Judging from the tone of the Liberal press -- including in that category Punch -- one would suppose that Lord RUSSELL's diplomacy had put European affairs generally upon a satisfactory basis. The congratulations of the multitude of friendly organs which Lord PALMERSTON appears to have at his service, seem to vary between a pleasing conviction that England has been kept out of war, and a quiet feeling of exultation that the Tories have been well beaten in a party fight. Copenhagen correspondents of the London press represent that this sort of thing is but indifferently well relished by the Danes. But that is a small matter. The self-complacency of the better portion of England is satisfied; and Punch's principal cartoon gives a perfect illustration to the prevailing popular feeling, by representing DISRAELI, the bully of St. Stephen's Academy and the plague of poor JOHNNY RUSSELL, in full receipt of a sound thrashing from GLADSTONE, the young chevalier of the school, and the protector of helpless urchins of the Russell class generally.
