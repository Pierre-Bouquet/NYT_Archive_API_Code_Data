"Having visited the extreme right wing of the army, going by way of the Chain Bridge, I devoted a day to that portion of it which lies along the main road to Fairfax. The country here is more open or less hilly than that on the right, and if it were not for the dense forests that occur at intervals, would not be bad for military movements on a large scale.

After having traversed so many of the great battle-fields of Europe, and examined them minutely, I have looked somewhat with dismay at the character of the region in which our vast army has got to manoeuvre.

I should say that fifty thousand men, well posted, ought to resist successfully an attack of nearly double that number. Wherever the forests are felled, it becomes totally impassable. On our right wing there are large tracts, so densely covered with the tops of fallen trees, that I defy an army to get over them under fire.

"To all who claim kindred to Ireland, it is eminently desirable that measures should be taken that some adequate share of the lustre which Irish soldiers may, in the present war, win for our national arms, should be reflected on the land of their nativity.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/01/archives/the-irish-brigade-to-the-public.html,,"To all who claim kindred to Ireland, it is eminently desirable that measures should be taken that some adequate share of the lustre which Irish soldiers may, in the present war, win for our national arms, should be reflected on the land of their nativity. Noris this object desirable to men of Irish race alone, but to the nation; for while the concurrent opinion of military men attests the fact that the Irish make as fine soldiers as the world produces, it also bears witness that their efficiency is much increased by their aggregation in regiments and larger divisions, without the admixture of other nationalities. They have a nature and characteristics in common, which officers of their own race share with them and can best understand stand. The same appeals which rouse the enthusiam of the individual soldier, touch electrically the whole mass; the same incentives to daring; the same motives for discipline; the same ancestral recollections, traditions and pride are common to all. Each man feels that the honor of his native land, as well as the cause for which he fights, is at stake in his conduct, whether in camp or on the field of battle. Hence the advantages of association, and hence the experience of all armies, in which Irishmen have served, affirms their unproved efficiency when united in organization. The English Government, whose experience has been larger than that of any other, has recognized and acted on these truths. Certain regiments in its service are always recruited in Ireland, and have borne for generations titles importing their origin and nationality. In the French service the historical glories of the Irish Brigade which, for a century and a half, maintained the prestige of the national valor, are imperishable. Even in our own recent experience, who can believe that the novices in war, who composed the rank and file of the Sixty-ninth, would have borne themselves so gallantly on the disastrous field of Manassas, had they been distributed through several regiments of various nationalties, having nothing in common with their fellow-soldiers, but the cause for which they fought? Aggregated together, the exploits of their countrymen at Fontenoy, Rainillies, Cremona, Badajos, and through all the battle-fields of Europe, appeal to the heart and nerve the arm or every man to an Irish regiment whenever the cry of battle swells upon his ear; he feels instinctively that the honor of his native land, and the military traditions of his race are committed to his personal keeping, and must at any sacrifice of self be transmitted untarnished to his posterity. Many other considerations concur to render it desirable that the Irish soldiers enlisted in the present war should, as far as practicable, be kept together, and not be carelessly suffered to become a mere dilution of the mass of the Union armies in the field. The President has, accordingly, authorized the formation of an Irish brigade for the service of the United States, and patriotic men have undertaken the work. Three regiments are to be raised in New-York; one in Pennsylvania, and one in Massachusetts. The command has been offered to Brig.-Gen. SHIELDS, whose arrivalfrom California is now looked for, and of whose acceptance satisfactory assurances have been given. The organization of the force is already in a state of forwardness; but come pecuniary means are needed, which the Government does not furnish, to advance it to completion with the rapidity necessary for the public service. Inevitable recruiting expenses are but partially defrayed by the War Department. Temporary subsistence of men from the time of enlistment till they go into camp -- an interval in the case of rural recruits of some days -- has also to be borne by individuals. The allowance made under the acts of Congress for military music -- indispensable for discipline, order and cheerfulness in the toils of the march or the entrenchment -- is found inadequate at a time when the demand has become so suddenly enlarged. The bounty provided by Government to the soldiers is payable only at the conclusion of their term or service; and their pay, although counted from the time or enlisting, is not received till the end of three months. Men who depend for the support of their families on their daily labor, absolutely need some temporary aid to enable them to bridge over the first three months, which happens, in the present instance, to be the hardest three months in the year. To aid in the formation and dispatch of the Irish Brigade, a Committee of citizens, who sympathize with the movement, has been organized, and now appeal to to the public, and particularly to all who claim Irish birth or lineage, for assistance in this most important object.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Irish Brigade.; TO THE PUBLIC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Irish Brigade.; TO THE PUBLIC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/79e3cd79-cc6f-5319-a62f-f02b7f13d43d,1154,nyt://article/79e3cd79-cc6f-5319-a62f-f02b7f13d43d,

I have reason to believe that the President has devolved the whole responsibility of a forward movement on Gen. McCLELLAN, and placed every facility in his power to accomplish it. If he fail to advance, it will be because his army is not perfect in all of its appointments, or that the enemy is too numerous, or too well intrenched, to justify an attack. Gen. MCCLELLAN's movements thus far have been characterized by extreme caution -- a quality, perhaps, which was required by the exigency of the times. He has shown great powers of organization, but that organization has not even yet been brought to the highest state of efficiency. It now remains to be proved whether he is possessed of that strategic skill, that power of wielding great masses, and throwing them with overpowering effect on a given point, which will entitle him to be enrolled among the great commanders. His onward course is beset with difficulties, but they are such as a great general, backed by the resources of the North, can overcome. In front, BEAUREGARD has withdrawn to his intrenchments, about Manassas Junction, and is busily engaged in preparing his Winter quarters. The nature of the intervening ground, between the hostile camps is impracticable for the manoeuvring of a large force; and his position, I have reason to believe, is so strong that it can be destroyed only by regular approaches, which is a slow and tedious process. In the meanwhile, his communications with the South and West are such that he can concentrate men and munitions by rail, quite as rapidly as we can by the common roads of the country.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/02/archives/european-intervention-in-mexico.html,,"The Hispano-Gallo-Anglican expedition to Mexico involves, it seems, a joint action, with a judicious distribution of parts. There were wrongs to be redressed, outrages to be punished, European subjects to be protected, and a stable government to be created; and these details of the business are assigned to the fleet and land forces of France and Spain. An army of six thousand men will be landed, and after the capture of Vera Cruz, will be marched to the City of Mexico. When once there, we are left in a maze of doubt as to its action. The Spanish official papers take pains to assert that the troops of that Government will lend themselves to the support of neither of the two factions now dividing the republic. But there is an apparent difficulty in achieving the task set down for the inland expedition if this programme be strictly adhered to by both its members. There must of necessity be a setting up and a putting down of factions, if anything like the contemplated reform of the Government be effected; and this Spanish declaration can only be construct as meaning that by a [???] partition of roles, France is to execute so much of the undertaking, as involves a forcible arbitration between the Liberals and Reactionists. But there need be no refining upon the subject. The mere fact of invasion, in the actual state of the Liberal Administration, practically settles the question. At the coming of the abhorred Gachupins, there may be a temporary rally of the people, forgetful for the moment of the priesthood, to the support of the Government. ""Death to foreigners"" will instantly become a national cry. The reckless massacre it will provoke will simply madden the invaders, and compel them to abandon the idea of relying upon the efficacy of a mere display of physical force; practical and positive warfare will ensue; and there can be little doubt as to which of the contestants will be driven to the wall. It will be a conflict between a disorganized and impoverished people; and two nations whose purses are long enough, and armies large enough, to fight thus conjointly the strongest isolated Government in the world.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'European Intervention in Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'European Intervention in Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-11-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f746c67-844c-533d-a8f9-8d958b848922,610,nyt://article/0f746c67-844c-533d-a8f9-8d958b848922,

He thinks the Navy Department, which did not send proper vessels, and more of them, is to blame, and not the force, which did the best it could. Perhaps he is right. But his explanations are certainly not of a cheering character. For three months out of the five since the establishment of the blockade, he tells us, a large steam-frigate, which did no service, and the Vandalia, a sailing vessel, drawing quite a heavy draught of water, and therefore incapable of capturing the small sloops and schooners that ran along the shore,"" composed the whole blockade off Charleston! What wonder, with this state of things, that the French Consul at Charlestos has recently been able to flaunt in Paris a schedule of three or fourscore ""vessels"" that had run the Charleston blockade! The writer of the communication cannot see how the Nashville could have escaped; there was the Roanoke commanding the entrance of the harbor, the Flag the southern channel, the Vandalia the northern, the Monticello cruising everywhere, and a bright moonlight all night! It is very extraordinary to be sure; but as not indeed the Nashville, but the Gorson really did escape, and carried Messrs. MASON, SLIDELL and suite to Cuba, we don't see but what somebody must have been napping. Perhaps they got out the same way the Thomas Watson got in.

The matter was placed in the hands of Detectives FARLEY and TIEMAN, and they at once set to work upon what was deemed an almost hopeless undertaking; but after much labor and effort, they succeeded in arresting a Mrs. MARKS and her sister, Miss ALBERTINA FLAUN, two Polish Jewesses who had accompanied the illfated FELLNER on his voyage to this City. They were taken to headquarters and there detained until Friday night, when Miss ALBERTINA FLAUN was taken to the Fourteenth Precinct Station-house and confined, enough having been ascertained by the officers to warrant them in the belief that she was an important witness in the investigation of the case. It was ascertained that on the passage over, the murdered man, Mr. FELLNER, and the two ladies above named, were very intimate -- so much so as to be noticeable to the passengers. Upon their arrival here FELLNER went to the Prescott House, and the ladies to a boarding-house, No. 45 East Broadway. Shortly after the two ladies called upon Mr. F. at the Prescott House, and during the interview there had, Mrs. MARKS is known to have charged Mr. F. with improper intercourse with her sister, Miss FLAUN, and demanded of him redress, with a dagger in her hand. Immediately after this meeting, FELLNER, who was known to have a confidant in the person of one RADETSKI, also a Polish Jew, boarding at No, 4 Carroll-street, Brooklyn, took counsel of him, and by his advice he removed his quarters from the Prescott House to Brooklyn. This was about ten days ago, and on the 22d ult., FELLNER disappeared from the boarding-house in Brooklyn, in company with his new-found friend, RADETSKI, and no more was seen of him until his body was found in the waters of New-Jersey. FELLNER was known to be possessed of a large amount of gold and diamonds, and it is believed by the police, that RADETSKI, with the aid of accomplices, had murdered him, and afterwards cast his body into the waters on the Jersey coast, in the hope that it would float out into the ocean, and never be heard or seen again.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW-JERSEY TRAGEDY.; Suicide of One of the Parties.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW-JERSEY TRAGEDY.; Suicide of One of the Parties.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2862e442-e75a-567b-b850-f7f9a117e08b,642,nyt://article/2862e442-e75a-567b-b850-f7f9a117e08b,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/03/archives/the-resignation-of-gen-scott.html,,"It cannot be otherwise than that the retirement of Gen. SCOTT from the command of the army, will be noted as an era in the military history of the country. His career, indeed, embodies all there is of the National military life since the revolutionary period. His first services as a soldier were in the second war with Great Britain. With all that was creditable and successful in that contest his name was associated; and when peace was concluded, it was found that while the honors of the navy were disputed by a half-score of heroes, between whose relative merits it was scarcely possible to distinguish, the palm of superior military skill was, by almost universal consent, assigned to Gen. SCOTT. It was after the conclusion of peace that Gen. JACKSON, by his gallant and successful defence of New-Orleans, appropriated a share of fame and respect, which his conduct of the Seminole war subsequently so augmented as perhaps to unduly overshadow and depreciate the genuine merits of SCOTT. But, while with less ambitious views than JACKSON, SCOTT confined himself strictly to a professional career, his hold upon the confidence and affection of the people was never weakened; and cotemporaries will recall the general expression of satisfaction, when he succeeded MACOMB as General-in-Chief of the army. It was not, as events proved, a succession to a sinecure. The South was about to precipitate the nation into a conflict with a neighboring Republic, the population of which had, in a random but continuous fashion, practiced themselves in the art and skill of fighting; while the existing generation of the American people, during a long period of peace, not otherwise broken than by frontier skirmishing with Indians, had lost all familiarity with the profession of soldiership. It fell upon Gen. SCOTT to convert a war, beginning with a series of victories in no wise earned by scientific management, or the observance of the maxims of practiced generalship, but rather secured by the exhibition of splendid valor, in a war of masterly conduct, where all the resources of military science were brought into action. No contrast could be greater than that between the operations of TAYLOR and those of SCOTT. The former carried into his campaigning the rapidity, courage and dash of a knighterrant; the latter moved slowly to his object, with a passionless adaptation of means to ends, a thorough appreciation of the relative strength and resources of the combatants, and the oversight of no element of safety and certainty. In short, he overcame the enemy by professional rule, and acquired the fame of a great General rather than of a daring leader. While such qualities command the respect of the masses of the people, the achievements of the cavalier are more to the popular taste. TAYLOR and JACKSON were heroes of popular idolatry; SCOTT was the object of profound regard; his reputation a matter of national pride: and his military talents have been looked to by the entire people as an always reliable defence, upon which, in case of danger to the country, confidence might be unhesitatingly reposed. Traits appealing to the imagination are the materials of which popularity is made. The characteristics of Gen. SCOTT appealed rather to the judgment and the understanding, and JACKSON and TAYLOR grasped the honors of the Presidency, which eluded the hand of the great soldier, as they had eluded the hands of civilians in their province equally great.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Resignation of Gen.

"The storm that passed over this city on Saturday evening was one of the most violent experienced here for many years. The rain fell in torrents, and almost without cessation, until midnight, and the wind blowed in fearful gusts, doing considerable damage, particularly to moveable fixtures. As usual on such occasions, signboards, awnings, chimney-tops, and ornamental frees were the first to yield to the blast, and were scattered in admirable confusion in every direction, so that pedestrianism was an unsafe experiment during the height of the gale. A new three-story brick house (unoccupied) on Elliot-place, between De Kalb and Lafayette avenues owned by JOHN BROPHY, was blown down, and a large number of buildings were more or less injured in different parts of the city.

It is easier to make a dyke that shall be invulnerable to the water on one side and to vermin on the other than to maintain a perfect blockade.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/04/archives/a-new-international-law-proposed.html,,"It is easier to make a dyke that shall be invulnerable to the water on one side and to vermin on the other than to maintain a perfect blockade. Three thousand miles of coast cannot be so walled in by ships that nothing can be thrown on the shore and nothing carried off. It was not an improved coastguard but a reduced tariff that suppressed the smuggling of French goods across the British Channel. It was not the force of our armies but the irresistible devices of commerce that broke down NAPOLEON's Berlin decrees. So we may be sure that, however legally effective may be the Federal blockade of the Southern ports, there will be always cotton ships crossing the Atlantic if the planters are willing to sell; and we may be sure that they will be the more willing the higher that prices rise through the rigor of the prohibition. But there is another fact no less certain, namely, that the quantity thus brought off will be quite insufficient for our wants, and at a rate far above our means. The world cannot afford to buy of us cloth, the raw material of which we have ransomed rather than purchased. Illicit supplies will help to keep us in work till the four quarters of the earth are teeming with the plant for which we have offered a reward. But if we try to make American cotton serve us as heretofore, we shall find the Indian weaver underselling us, by working up in his rude loom the fibres we have caused to be grown. We must have free trade in cotton and free trade in bread, in time of war as in time of peace, if ever again we are to be at ease touching food and labor. In place of idly speculating upon the supplies that may reach us in driblets, or madly threatening the belligerents with European intervention, our politicians and manufacturers should address themselves in earnest to an amendment of the law of nations. Seeing that all the great Powers are, more or less, concerned in the relaxation of the American blockade, why should they not address to the United States Government a proposal based upon its own language in 1856 and 1857? Why should they not invite its assent to a general agreement, exempting all private property not of a warlike nature from blockading and privateering? Such an agreement would afford no special advantage to the Confederates -- for it would leave exposed to confiscation all cotton consigned to their Government. It would, therefore, do no injustice to the Federalists -- reopeningto them, indeed, a lucrative trade, from which they are now shut out. It would involve no presumption on the part of the European Powers -- and no humiliation, save to the Government by whom such proposals were scouted when they came from Washington. Our Chambers of Commerce then urged their acceptance. Let the same and other Mercantile Associations unite now to press the matter upon the attention of our statesmen. Let the French manufacturers be invited to join with those of England in addresses to their respective Governments for this just and beneficent object. The success of such a movement would do far more than relieve the severity of a present exigency. It would establish as a principle the liberation of peaceful commerce from the bonds of war, and secure at least one great benefit to mankind from a war of uncertain though unfolding issues.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NEW INTERNATIONAL LAW PROPOSED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A NEW INTERNATIONAL LAW PROPOSED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Star', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6ac38b1-e6fd-5c91-afbc-9bcda6bcf4d6,581,nyt://article/e6ac38b1-e6fd-5c91-afbc-9bcda6bcf4d6,

That difficulty has been considerably diminished by the proceedings of the meeting referred to. The speeches made on that occasion, and the specific claims of the candidate whose election it was designed to aid, leave very little to be learned upon that subject. If we were to hear that the City of New-Orleans had elected for Sheriff a man who refused to fight against the Union, -- who had quit the field of battle on the eve of an engagement, -- who had left the ground just as the action commenced, and who had been branded in the official report of the commanding General as having ""marched to the rear to the sound of the enemy's cannon,"" -- we should have no difficulty whatever in coming to the conclusion that the City of New-Orleans had very strong sympathies with the Union, and was only half in earnest in its pretended support of the Union cause.

"vestigation in the case of the two men, JOHN GALLIGAN and JAMES ENGLISH, the victims of the tragedy at Marcellus last Monday night, resulted last evening in the rendering of a verdict that they were killed by ALBERT BESSY and JOHN ENGLISH, all the parties being under the influence of liquor at the time. A warrant for the arrest of the implicated parties was immediately issued by Coroner DIDAMA, and Deputy-Sheriff GILBERT, aided by Chief MULHOLLAND, immediately arrested BESSY and ENGLISH. BESSY and his wife had been before the Coroner's Jury, and they were still at Alvord's Hotel, in Marcellus, where the investigation was held, when he was taken in custody. ENGLISH was at his father's house, three-quarters of a mile from Marcellus, and was greatly surprised when the officer called for him. His father and mother were much distressed that their youngest boy should be charged with his own brother's murder.

She had been confined there since Saturday last. Previous to her entering the cell, a search was made by a matron to see that she had no instruments or means of self-destruction. Notwithstanding this precaution, it appears that she had secreted about her a penknife, with which she attempted to end her existence. The female in charge of her was in the room at the time, and so well was her plan of self-destruction put into execution that she did not suspect her purpose. Mrs. MARKS was sitting on a lounge, with a shawl around her, and her right arm thrown over the back of her seat, and her left hand she used for the purpose of taking from her secret pocket the penknife, and thrusting it into the main artery of her right arm. She was careful to hold her wounded arm so far over the back of the lounge that her keeper could not discover the blood as it flowed from the wounds, especially as it was covered by her shawl. It happened, however, that very shortly after she had inflicted the wound, the female guard had occasion to go out for a few minutes, and during her absence an officer took her place. He at once discovered that his prisoner looked very pale and languid, and went to Capt. HELME, telling him his suspicions that all was not right. Upon the Captain's arrival, he immediately removed her shawl, and discovered the blood running in a stream from the wounded arm. The prisoner fast becoming insensible, a surgeon was called forthwith, the artery closed, and the wound dressed, but last evening the unfortunate woman was so low that little hopes were entertained of her recovery by the surgeon. When asked by the officers why she had attempted to end her existence at this time, she replied that she felt sad on account of the death of her sister, Miss FLAUME, and that she had a fear that she herself would be convicted of the murder of FELLNER unless she died before they had a chance to try her.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FELLNER MURDER.; Attempted Suicide of Mrs. Marks--Confession, &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FELLNER MURDER.; Attempted Suicide of Mrs. Marks--Confession, &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/86d805a2-f94b-5ff6-b256-48ba8379b961,541,nyt://article/86d805a2-f94b-5ff6-b256-48ba8379b961,

It is understood that he intends to make this City his home, and that he will enter at once upon the practice of the profession in which he has won such conspicuous honors abroad. In spite of the barriers that oppose the progress of mere talent, however great, to high success in England, Mr. JAMES had achieved, without the slightest aid from aristocratic connections, the very high distinction of standing among the foremost members of the British Bar. Since the elevation of Sir FREDERICK THESIGER to the chancelorship and that of Sir ARTHUR COCKBURN to the Chief Justiceship of the Queen's Bench, he has been almost without a rival, in some branches of the profession. As a parliamentary counsel, even previous to their elevation, he held the highest position No member or petitioner believed his chances secure until Mr. JAMES had been retained, and the statute book of England is indebted to him for the new bankruptcy act, and many of the wisest measures which have marked the course of legal reform in the past few years. In all the ""causes celebres"" which have awakened interest here, he has figured as leading counsel either for the prosecution or defence. The conduct of the case against PALMER, in the celebrated Rugeley poisoning, was committed to him. In the prosecution of BERNARD for conspiracy against the life of LOUIS NAPOLEON, he led for the defence, and his eloquent vindication is almost as familiar among us as it is over Europe. But recently, in the case of Col. DICKSON against the Earl of Wilton, he did battle for the soldier's rights and honor against the whole power of the Court and Horseguards, and obtained a verdict of twenty thousand dollars.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Admission of Edwin James to the American Bar.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Admission of Edwin James to the American Bar.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fb57e2d2-888a-5a39-8fd2-6cdbe0326fbd,727,nyt://article/fb57e2d2-888a-5a39-8fd2-6cdbe0326fbd,

The former is only about twenty-five miles above Charleston, while the latter is about fifty-five miles below -- the coast line running northeast and southwest. The steamer Monticello, from the blockading fleet off Savannah, arrived at Fortress Monroe on Monday, and reports that she passed the fleet on Saturday night, opposite Cape Roman, within thirty miles of Bull's Bay, moving along in fine style. The officers of the Monticello express the belief that the landing was made in Bull's Bay, where there were no fortifications of consequence. On the other hand, a Norfolk paper of Monday, received at Fortress Monroe, asserts that the destination of the fleet was known to be Port Royal, though no information had been received there relative to its movements. There are various reasons in favor of the supposition that Port Royal is the place aimed at. Beaufort, the harbor of which it commands, is about equidistant between Savannah and Charleston, and it is a good point from which to conduct operations against either of these cities, should such a course be contemplated. It is situated on the west bank of the Port Royal River, a narrow arm of the sea, and contains about nine hundred inhabitants. The harbor, which is sixteen miles from the main ocean, is spacious, but a bar prevents the entrance of vessels drawing more than eleven feet of water -- consequently the larger vessels of the fleet cannot pass in.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1fd5daf1-73c1-5a69-a15f-be6f4d714625,1174,nyt://article/1fd5daf1-73c1-5a69-a15f-be6f4d714625,

In a few hours' run down the Bay, she displayed qualities of speed which seemed to place her at the head of the screw steam fleet belonging to the commercial world. In every other respectshe seemed to be the equal of any vessel that leaves our port to cross the Atlantic. Since then the City of New-York has made an eastern and a western passage, both of so remarkable a character that the best expectations excited on the occasion we have referred to were more than realized. She left her dock at Pier No. 44 North River on the 5th of August, and after being detained several hours by the tide, crossed the bar at 4 1/2 o'clock, P.M. Nine days and fourteen hours afterwards she was in the harbor of Queenstown, beating the Persia, which followed three days later, by several hours. During this passage, and the one just completed, the vessel was not allowed to run at her full pressure of steam, owing to the newness of the engines, which might easily have become heated. Hence it is reasonable to expect that in a more favorable period of the year, and when the motive power can be used to its fullest capacity, the vessel will exceed her best running this season. And yet it will be seen by the following extract from the log that the western trip was one of the most remarkable ever made, having been accomplished in the space of nine days and four hours. The storm prevented the vessel from reaching her dock on Saturday, and, indeed, she was compelled to put to sea during the most violent portion of it.

He was too timid to take the first place in politics, and perhaps he was too unsettled ever to be a safe guide. On the other hand, his administrative ability was of a high order, and his eloquence, his noble presence and his fine voice were extremely effective, and made him at once a formidable opponent in Parliament and a valuable member of any Cabinet.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Sir James Graham.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Sir James Graham.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DEATHS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-11-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6ca8191c-1d5f-5d71-a77a-ee8154df8622,449,nyt://article/6ca8191c-1d5f-5d71-a77a-ee8154df8622,

Whereas three months since a conflict with England appeared so nearly inevitable, that statesmen on both sides of the water had almost abandoned the hope of uninterrupted peace; and, whereas, only four weeks ago, the rebel agents at London and Paris seemed to have everything their own way; we have now the most satisfactory proof of the ascendency which the cause and success of this Government have acquired with the Governments of France and England. The London Post, an official exponent of the British policy, announces to the persons who have been actively agitating for a forcible rupture of the blockade, that the hope of such intervention may be dismissed once for all. The English Government will, in no event, interfere in the American quarrel. So long as a blockade is maintained, British shipmasters must run it at their own risk; nothing will lead the Government to desert its position of neutrality in order to protect them. And while the suffering and disturbance which the manufacturing interests must undergo, in the absence of the usual supplies of cotton, are apprehended at their full value, the unalterable resolution of the Government to resist firmly the temptation to relieve the agony of its subjects, at the cost of a violation of international law and the risk of a foreign war, is placed beyond the possibility of a doubt.

He received the order relieving him of his command on Saturday, and when the truth became known it created the most intense excitement throughout his command. Great numbers of the officers, it is stated, signified their intention to resign at once, and many companies laid down their arms, declaring their disinclination to fight under my other leader. Gen. FREMONT did his best to counteract this feeling, and urged upon officers and men the duty of obedience to the behests of the Government. He also issued a farewell order to the army, in which he expressed his regret at being obliged to leave upon the eve of a battle. On Sunday morning he left with his Staff and body guard for St. Louis -- the command devolving upon Gen. POPE until Gen. HUNTER's arrival. Gen. FELMOST's removal, it will be seen by our dispatches, has been effected literally in sight of the enemy, who at last accounts were encamped upon the old Wilson's Creek battle-ground. Small bodies of them came within twelve miles of Springfield on Saturday, and it was ascertained that their advance, 2,800 strong, was approaching. PRICE was reported to be at Cassville on Thursday last, with 25,000 men, and BEN MCCULLOCH ten miles nearer Springfield with 10,000 more, while still another 10,000 were expected from Arkansas, and accessions were being made from the rebel residents of Green, Jasper and other adjoining counties. The entire army of PRICE is estimated as high as 60,000 men. It appears certain that a great battle must soon be fought, and probably on the same ground made memorable by the death of the gallant LYON. The successor of Gen. FREMONT, we learn from Washington, is likely to be Gen. HALLECK or Gen. BUEL.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION. GENERAL NEWS. Gen.

To the task of recovering possession of the river, it was an essential preliminary that this force should be dispersed; and Gen.

There were four steamers, upon which were transported five regiments of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and a battery of field pieces; while two gunboats were in attendance to protect the landing. The landing was effected on Thursday morning; and hardly were the troops drawn up in line of battle when the action commenced. Notwithstanding the inferiority of numbers, the National force seems to have had all the earlier honors of the fight, driving the rebels back to their camp, and then beyond it; and with the National flag replacing the emblem of secession over CHEATEM'S headquarters.

"In nearly every militarydepartment, and in almost every column of the army, the commanding officers have been superseded or transferred since the opening of this brief war. In Baltimore, Butler gave place to Cadwallader, and he in turn to Banks, and Banks again to Dix. In St. Louis, when Harney made his incongruous treaty, the Government removed him, and gave Lyon command; Lyon was soon subordinated to Fremont, who now, in turn, gives place to Hunter. On the Upper Potomac, Patterson was superseded by Banks; at Fortress Monroe. Butler was superseded by Wool; in Kentucky, Anderson was followed by Sherman, who now gives up his command to Buel. A Cairo, Grant, took the place of Prentiss in Western Virginia, Rosecrans succeeded McClellan. At Washington, McDowell, or account of Bull Run, was superseded by McClellan; and now Scott himself gives place to the last named General. Some of these officers have been displaced for incompetency or blundering; others have been transferred to more responsible posts, or posts more adapted to their genius; intrigue may have had something to do with the removal of others; while some not named have been removed for drunkenness and immorality. When a General fails of success, we want him out of the road at once. In this we but follow the example of other nations in great crises. In the days of the first French revolution, unsuccessful or blundering Generals were speedily put out of the way by decapitation, and the quick guillotine performed the work now accomplished in a milder but equally effective manner. This was done in numerous instances until the military bunglers were all weeded out, and then the Republican army brought forth a list of great Generals unparalleled in the history of any other people. In the Crimean war, again, St. Arnaud died, and Canrobert was superseded, and Pelissier proved to be the man for the the emergency. In our Revolution also, and in the war of 1812, we had the same experience with our Generals in many cases that we are having now.

As well in the Old World as in the New, she has undertaken the laborious role of a first-rate Power. Having dispersed the Carlists, and expelled CRISTINA, the Government of ISABELLA has succeeded in courting the presence of foreign capital and enterprise, a transfusion which has given life to her dying industrial energies, and some revenue and more credit to the national exchequer. To create a navy and an army would naturally be the first use a military Prime Minister would make of his new resources; and Marshal O'DONNELL has created both, and by the war in Morocco, and participation in the attack upon Cochin China, has sought to afford both the practical drill and experience which the French military establishment has acquired in the finishing schools of Algeria, Crimea and Italy. Now it is observable that all those who bear about them maiden swords, are not usually free from a certain swagger and provocative bluster, which often impels them to flesh their maiden weapons rashly and indiscriminately. Spain, in resuming her youth, has not dispensed with these youthful attributes. Having seduced Dominica, and, wrenching as it were the very knocker from the gate of Portau-Prince, bullied and insulted the Haytian Republic, she turns to Liberia, that other and only remaining negro Republic on the map, and picks a quarrel with its sable Government. And as if practice upon the African races. Moorish and Hametic, had strengthened her arm for strife of a higher order, we find her also aiming a blow at Mexico, with a view of restoring, if not a Spanish viceroy, at least a decided Spanish influence, over the affairs of that country. By such demonstrations we are constrained to recognize the resolute purpose of the Spaniard to recover the place in affairs of the world, which he once conquered, and has so long lost.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spain as one of the Great Powers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spain as one of the Great Powers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Spain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-11-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32897ba9-771a-5f65-bb99-c30578a94f08,961,nyt://article/32897ba9-771a-5f65-bb99-c30578a94f08,

Necessarily there is a certain sameness about all African adventure; DU CHAILLU introduced a new feature in his story in the way of the gorilla; but he was a fortunate and exceptional mortal. Every one cannot light on a new species of ape. Like his predecessors, Mr. ANDERSSON seems to have found a peculiar pleasure in ""bagging"" beasts of the desert and jungle. Whether elephant or giraffe, graceful antelope or plain and practical rhinoceros, all was game that came before his rifle. Now Mr. ANDERSSON breakfasted on an elephant cutlet, anon he supped from stewed lion. And about this latter meal the halo of a poetical justice hovers. Even the sentimentalist who enters a sad protest against slaughter, cannot think it wrong to eat the animal that would feel no hesitation, be troubled by no delicate scruples as to eating you. In thus heaping live coals upon the juicy steaks of his enemies, Mr. ANDERSSON must have enjoyed a species of savage Sardanapalism that can only occur to a man once or twice in a lifetime, and then in Africa.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/42b3c41c-4e59-557f-8ad3-97b0b5fa3900,3503,nyt://article/42b3c41c-4e59-557f-8ad3-97b0b5fa3900,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/10/archives/general-city-news.html,,"A NOTED CONFIDENCE MAN CAUGHT. -- JAMES McMANUS, alias JAMES BRADY, was arrested by officer GOLDEN, of the Sixth Precinet, on Friday night, charged with grand larceny upon several occasions. The prisoner is a man of some note, and some time ago figured in the papers as the person who robbed a lady of money and diamonds, to the value of between $4,000 and $5,000, while on a steamboat passing down the Mississippi River. About 18 months ago, he made the acquaintance of Mr. GEO. HARRISON, a wealthy gentleman, residing at No. 146 Thompson-street, in this City, and by his superior address and line, manly appearance, so won the confidence of HARRISON that he loaned him money to quite a large amount, and upon one occasion bought two silk dresses for MCMANUS' wife. About the time the dresses, were bought, MCMANUS went to HARRISON's house at an early hour one morning, and by false representations forced his way into Mr. HARRISON's chamber while he was asleep, took from a dressing-table a watch and chain, valued at $200, and some other articles, and with them made his escape. The next we hear of him is in New-Orleans, where he represented himself as a Methodist minister, dressed as such and preached as he had opportunity. Some time in March last he made the acquaintance of Mr. MCCLUSKY, at the Park House, in this City. The meeting was apparently a casual one, and soon Mr. MCCLUSKY became so enamored with the learning and fine social qualities of MCMANUS, that at the conclusion of an evening's conversation he invited him to remain at the hotel with him during the night. MCMANUS represented to MCCLUSKY that he was at that time a Professor at Princeton College, N.J. During the night Prof. MCMANUS stole the gold watch of his friend, and also three gold chains and some other articles, valued in all at about $650, and made his escape. Mr. MCCLUSKY, who resides in Boston, at once made known to the police the loss he had sustained, and from that time Officer GOLDEN has had the matter in charge, and been on the lookout for the prisoner. When arrested, he at first denied the charge, but subsequently admitted that he was the person who robbed MCCLUSKY, and stated that he should plead guilty if a charge was made by him. Justice CONNOLLY held the prisoner for examination in default of bail. MCCLUSKY's watch and chains were recovered yesterday from a pawn-shop in Walker-street. MCMANUS is about thirty-five years of age, of fine personal appearance, converses very well, and is apparently a well-educated man. He says he is a native of Philadelphia. Mr. MCCLUSKY has been telegraphed to come on, and enter a complaint against the prisoner.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56a78a5d-d438-52c8-b3e2-e6ffe20b4bc3,934,nyt://article/56a78a5d-d438-52c8-b3e2-e6ffe20b4bc3,

"EXCITING CATASTROPHE -- Two LAKE SCOWS OVER THE FALLS. -- An exciting disaster occurred at Chippewa on Monday afternoon. The scows Hotspur and Atlantic, which had been locked into Chippewa Creek, from the Wetland Canal, on their way to this city, were rendered unmanageable by the freshet, and breaking loose from the tug Whip, which was endeavoring to check the velocity of their approach toward the liver, were swept at terrific speed through the village.

"CRANBERRIES ON HIGH LAND.?For several years past, we have been attempting to raise cranberries on high land, that had been allowed to mature the seeds of a variety of weeds indefinitely before the land came into our possession. The plants grew well enough on this soil,  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/10/archives/agricultural-and-domestic.html,,"CRANBERRIES ON HIGH LAND. -- For several years past, we have been attempting to raise cranberries on high land, that had been allowed to mature the seeds of a variety of weeds indefinitely before the land came into our possession. The plants grew well enough on this soil, but the incessant pulling of weeds so often disturbed the young ""runners,"" that they did not have time to get a fair hold of the soil, and of course did not succeed well. This experiment was continued two or three years, and then abandoned. The next attempt was upon a piece of underdrained ""swale"" land; that is, land such as we have all over New-England, bordering meadows, or the low ""runs"" among the uplands. The piece we selected was of the latter description, where the surplus water found its way out from a series of gently swelling hills. It would have been good corn land in a moderately dry season. The water, however, before it was drained remained in it late enough in the Spring to cause it to send up rushes, in some places, flags, and a variety of rank meadow grasses. This was its condition when selected for cranberries. Six months later it was thoroughly drained by the use of tile laid four feet deep, which resulted in bringing in timothy and red top, without the aid of plowing or adding seed -- on three sides of the piece there being a stout growth of both these grasses. The process was to cover the rushes and meadow grass with coarse gravel, so that none of it could be seen. A little fine meadow muck, say fifteen bushels to the rod, was spread over the gravel, and the plants set about one foot apart in each direction. The plants were taken from a common cranberry meadow, and set from the middle to the last of April. The only thing done to them since has been to keep out all weeds and grass that have made their appearance; and this must be done with care, so as not to disturb the sod or plant, which was originally set, or the ""runners"" which have started out from it. On the single rod where the plants have been set three years, in the first week of September, we gathered one bushel of cranberries, and we have seen but a single lot in market that will compare with them in size. On a rod set two years eight quarts were gathered. There amounts were in clean, sound cranberries, with probably not an imperfect one amongst them, as they were gathered by hand. A cranberry patch has a value beside that found in its fruit, as there is scarcely anything more ornamental in the vicinity of the dwelling. The plants have a dark, but brilliant green in the Spring and early Summer, and when in blossom, at a little distance, present the appearance of a slight fall of snow upon them; and on a nearer approach, the delicate line of pink on the blossom gives then a very beautiful appearance. They remain in this condition for more than two weeks. In the Autumn, when the leaves have matured, they present various shades of red, and thus remain pleasant and inviting to the eye until snow covers them for the Winter. From observation and careful inquiry through several years, we are satisfied that not more than one family in ten in Massachusetts ever have a cranberry in the house. They are only common with a comparatively few. In our opinion this ought not to be so, because we are convinced that their usefulness does not cease with the mere gratification of the taste. Physicians inform us that they possess valuable medicinal qualities, which give tone and healthy action to the liver and kidneys, and favor the removal of vitiated matters which have become useless and injurious to the system. The preparation of the cranberry for the table, requires a good deal of sugar, to be sure -- but sugar is an exceedingly nutritions and healthy article when taken as a portion of the meal, and is undoubtedly, so far as economy is concerned, cheaper than meat. We hope others will try the experiment of raising the cranberry on high land, so as to establish the fuel that such culture is feasible, and that all our people may have cranberries at hand for their [???] and [???], and as a condiment for their roasted [???] on Thanksgiving Day, or for their roasted motion, when they are so fortunate as to have it. -- N.E.

Our Washington correspondent, however, in his communication of the 7th, removes all doubts as to the real business of MIRAMON in the Spanish capital, by announcing that the Mexican Chief has been appointed a Lieutenant-General in the service of Spain, and that he is to be second in command of the military force destined to invade, within a few weeks, his ill-fated country. His acceptance of a commission in the army of ISABELLA, his consenting to be a leader of the very expedition which is about to assail his native Republic, only too plainly demonstrate the object of his visit to Spain.

The intelligence which we publish to-day comes by way of Hatteras Inlet, brought to Fortress Monroe by the steamer Spaulding, and by way of Cairo, through Memphis papers received there. A person has arrived at the Inlet from the main land in a small boat, and communicated the information that two forts at Port Royal entrance had been captured; that a large National force had been landed; that Beaufort had been occupied after a portion of the town had been burned, and that our troops had advanced and taken possession of the railroad connecting Charleston and Savannah -- probably at Coosahatchie -- capturing a large quantity of stores. No dates are given, and nothing whatever is said of the character of the fighting which must have taken place before so much could be accomplished. Deserters from the rebels, who have reached Newport's News, from up the James River, state that the utmost consternation exists in the rebel army, and that a number of regiments have been sent South to meet this new danger to the bogus Confederacy. The news by way of Cairo is more explicit in some respects. The Memphis papers received there contain dispatches from Savannah fully confirming the landing of our forces and the capture of three forts, -- this is the number known to have been erected by the rebels, -- at Port Royal, Hilton Head and Bay Point. The excellent map, which we publish this morning, will enable our readers to determine the location of these forts. The statement that the National forces had possession of the town of Beaufort is also confirmed, and the losses of the rebels are admitted to be heavy. The report of the wreck of the steamer Union is confirmed by the gunboat Albatross, which has arrived at Fortress Monroe from the blockade on the North Carolina coast. She went ashore on the 6th inst. about eight miles to the eastward of Bogue Inlet. The steamer Winfield Scott is said to have been in company with her, and it is conjectured that she also may have been lost, but there is no certainty about it.

The butchers, five hundred in number, dashed into the town, fell upon the unarmed National soldiers, and after killing a number, as yet unascertained, made captives of the remainder, those only who had declined the hospitality of the conspirators escaping.

It is obtained from rebel sources, no dispatch-boat having yet arrived direct from the fleet. The expedition approached Port Royal Entrance on Thursday last, at 9 o'clock in the morning, and engaged Forts Walker and Beauregard, on Hilton Head and Bay Point, and during the hottest of the fire several vessels of the fleet passed in and took possession of the mouths of the inlets leading to Beaufort, Savannah and Charleston, which they immediately blockaded, apparently according to a preconcerted plan. Four other vessels made directly for Beaufort, and at last advices were within sight of the city. Meantime, the forts at the entrance, mounting some thirty to thirty-six guns, had been reduced and were taken possession of by our forces and preparations were being made to land on Port Royal Island and attack Beaufort. Only one of the National gunboats is known to have been lost, and she was burnt. Some accounts say that several others were disabled, but there is no certainty about this. The rebels complain that the guns in their batteries were very badly served, while those of the fleet were served with the greatest precision. Commodore TATNALL, as before announced, was in command of the rebel ""fleet."" consisting principally of tug-boats, but when the National vessels entered Broad River his vessels scattered, and he landed to assist in saving the shore guns.

"While the naval success at Beaufort does splendid credit to one arm of the service, we must not lose sight of the victory achieved by the other in Kentucky.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/14/archives/kentucky-and-east-tennessee.html,,"While the naval success at Beaufort does splendid credit to one arm of the service, we must not lose sight of the victory achieved by the other in Kentucky. For the latter, in its immediate consequences, is perhaps of greater value than the former. It so happens that simultaneous with the advance of Gen. ANELSON and his army to Piketon, the Union men of Tennessee had commenced the only species of warfare against their oppressors for which they possessed weapons. The East Tennessee Railroad is the main, because the direct thoroughfare between Richmond and New-Orleans, and the only one entirely secure from destruction at the hands of maritime expeditions. It might be easy for an enemy coming from the sea to cut off the coastline, by destroying the bridge at Weldon, in North Carolina, or that at Petersburgs Virginia; but the inland route has been regarded as secure, because, by nothing short of a general and successful advance of the National army into the southernmost Border States, has it been deemed possible to interfere with intercourse in that quarter. Nine-tenths of the food which feeds the rebel troops in Virginia, and a majority of the munitions of war -- the gunpowder, the caps, the cannon-balls, the shoes, the grain and the pork, upon which they are dependent, pass over the East Tennessee Railroad to Lynchburgh and Richmond. The Atlantic States do very little in supplying aught but men; the great valley of the Mississippi is looked to for the rest. The Tennessee Unionists have proved to the insurgent Government how hugely its confidence is misplaced. If the accounts received of their doings be correct -- and they come from rebel authorities who would be interested in withholding the report of such disasters from the Northern public, -- nearly all the principal bridges on the road between Knoxville and the Virginia line have been destroyed; bridges, two or three of which it is probably beyond the reach of rebel resources and enginery to replace. This is a victory hardly less important than that of NELSON. In conjunction with that, it will very certainly oblige ZOLLICOFFER to return into East Tennessee, whither he will be followed by a Union army about which the thousands of that quarter of the State who have stedfastly voted against, and to the last opposed the treason of Gov. HARRIS, and his fellow-plotters, will rapidly congregate. A strong National army once established in this all-important locality, the back of rebellion will be broken.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Kentucky and East Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Kentucky and East Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06c3f5e8-6c5e-55c8-a179-d82b73b52d46,416,nyt://article/06c3f5e8-6c5e-55c8-a179-d82b73b52d46,

"The arrival of the United States gunboat Bienville at this port, from Port Royal, S.C., via Fortress Monroe, enables us to lay before the renders of the TIMES a full and authentic account, from our own correspondents, of the movements of the Great Expedition, from its departure, up to and including the attack upon and capture of the rebel batteries at Hilton Head and Bay Point, at the entrance of Port Royal harbor, and the landing of our troops. The expedition arrived off Port Royal on Sunday, Nov. 3 -- a portion of the fleet, however, being detained by the gale. The steamers Vixen and Mercury were sent on Monday morning to sound the channel, and were soon followed by several of the gunboats, which were fired upon by the batteries of Fort Beauregard. The rebel Commodore TATNALL also attacked them with his gunboats, but darkness put an end to the contest for that day. On Tuesday morning, the 4th, the whole fleet entered the harbor, and Gens. SHERMAN, WRIGHT and STEVENS made a reconnoissance, to ascertain the location of the rebel batteries, by drawing their fire. At 7 o'clock A.M. the enemy opened fire from their batteries and gunboats, the National fleet responding with promptitude and telling effect. Our gunboats withdrew about 9 o'clock, having gained a full knowledge of the location and strength of the enemy's batteries. In the afternoon the heavy men-of-war moved inward to get into position, but the Wabash grounded, where she remained for an hour and a half. This circumstance postponed the general engagement. On Wednesday, the 5th, the day was stormy and unfavorable, and a council of war decided to ""wait a little longer."" On Thursday, at 9 o'clock A.M., the fleet got underway, and at a few minutes past 10 o'clock the rebels opened fire again. The Wabash gave one broadside to Fort Walker, on Hilton Head, and another to Fort Beauregard, on Bay Point. The rebel navy also opened fire but kept at a prudent distance from the big guns of Uncle Sam's ships. The Wabash, Susquehannah and Bienville swept down in line, and delivered their compliments at Hilton Head in the shape of 10-second shells, while the lively gunboats put in the punctuation points for the benefit of the rebel Commodore, at the same time enfilading the two batteries. The firing was now incessant, and a perfect shower of shot and shell fell inside the rebel forts. At noon, the three ships above-named came down, and poured full broadsides into the two forts, the gunboats keeping their positions, and doing excellent service. The flag-ship, the Susquehannah and Bienville, went within six hundred yards, and made terrible havoc with their 5-second shells, silencing several of the enemy's guns. This fire was continued for four hours, during which the National fleet delivered over two thousand rounds. The rebels fought with desperation and inflicted considerable damage on our vessels' nearly all of which were hit by shots. At 3 o'clock P.M. the guns of the enemy had been dismounted or silenced, and Commander JOHN ROGERS went on shore at Fort Walker and found it vacated, and hoisted the Stars and Stripes. A considerable number of killed and wounded were discovered, and it was estimated that the enemy must have suffered a loss of at least one hundred men killed and an equal number severely wounded. Bay Point battery was taken possession of on Friday at sunrise. The rebels fled in the greatest confusion, leaving everything in their tents, even to their swords, watches, private papers and clothing. The loss on board of the National fleet was eight killed, and six severely and seventeen slightly wounded. The troops landed and took possession on Thursday evening, and next day the Bienville left with dispatches for the Government. It will be noticed that the accounts which have previously reached us through rebel sources have been wonderfully correct, considering their origin -- only a few trifling disasters to our vessels having been thrown in by way of offset to their humiliating reverse.

The Yankee ingenuity and practical talent, which have done such wonders in the arts of peace, have been applied comparatively little to the business of a campaign, and they certainly have not, thus far, produced the results we might have expected in the present war. How, for instance, ten or fifteen thousand men of New-England could encamp for months on the banks of a river, which they knew must ultimately be crossed with artillery and with masses of men, and never prepare any boats or materials for a bridge, of attach to their camps any pontoon-train, is something utterly incomprehensible to any European army, though composed of men with not half the invention or business patent. Suddenly, after our most gallant and heroic men are caught on the further bank, between an overwhelming force in front and the torrent in the rear, the commanding officer is heard inquiring whether there are any means of transport, in case of retreat! Now, after the calamity, after a defeat which, but for the heroic bravery shown by the men, would be most discouraging and painful, the whole army and country wake to the discovery that ""we have no pontoon-train"" anywhere on the line of the Potomac! It seems as if nothing but disaster and defeat will ever teach us the simplest rules of military preparation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Saddle-Ambulances.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Saddle-Ambulances.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ce7bbaba-7e21-59a3-9f16-302ace3b301f,1057,nyt://article/ce7bbaba-7e21-59a3-9f16-302ace3b301f,

A Business Committee of five was then appointed, and the delegates proceeded to the Tabernacle Baptist Church, corner of Tenth-street and Second-avenue, where they were formally received and welcomed, in behalf of the New-York Association, by Rev. S.H. TYNG. The exercises at the Church were opened with singing and prayer, after which P. HARWOOD VERNON, President of the New-York Association, made a brief introductory address. Dr. TYNG, in an appropriate address then welcomed the delegates. He alluded to the great amount of good that had been accomplished by the Associations in attending to the spiritual and bodily wants of our soldiers, and there were grand results in war, as well as painful ones. He held that slavery of man was a thousand fold worse than any warfare that could be waged to overturn and destroy it. In speaking of JOHN C. FREMONT, he said that he would yet prove the pathfinder of humanity. He also spoke in glowing terms of Commodore DUPONT, and justly eulogized the irreproachable character of Gen. SCOTT.

While there together in the afternoon, it appears, her brother suddenly heard a fall, and proceeding down the stairway saw his little sister lying on the floor apparently lifeless, she having fallen from the upper floor through a trap door, which was used to ventilate the loft of the stable. Lustily calling for assistance, the family promptly came to his aid, and the little sufferer was taken into the house and medical aid immediately sent for. Dr. HYDE, being an invalid and a sufferer, from a severe nervous disease, was not notified of the sad occurrence, but Drs. HURD, LANDON and KISSAM were soon in attendance, and restoratives were at once applied. For the time being hopes were entertained of her recovery, as she rallied a little, but after that her pulse rapidly declined, and congestion of the brain having set in, she expired before 5 P.M. This terrible blow deeply affects a large circle of the Doctor's relatives and friends, as the child was an exceedingly bright and interesting girl.

This is not, perhaps, a matter of surprise, although it seems as though the facts testified to by the witnesses for the prosecution were sufficient to warrant a verdict against him. If those witnesses were to be believed, and there was no reason why they should not have been, beyond the fact that they were engaged on the same vessel, there could be no doubt that WESTERVELT kept count of the negroes as they were shipped, helped to rig the stagings by which they came up the ship's side, and performed his duties as third Mate up to the period of the capture of the vessel, during all the time of her lying in the Congo River while the preparations for the voyage were going on and during all the time she was dodging about to avoid the English and American cruisers -- now out to sea for a day or a week, and now back to the coast again, watching her chance to take in her cargo without detection. It is possible that the jury may not have believed the witnesses, even in the total absence of any explanation from the accused, but it is more likely that the four jurors who were for acquittal hung upon the point in the Judge's charge, that he might have been ""under compulsion, physical or moral,"" that he might have been ""beguiled into it by the arts or power of others until too late to extricate himself,"" although no shadow of compulsion was proved and he had repeated opportunities to get away from the vessel if he had desired, as she was boarded five or six times by English and American cruisers, while she was waiting for a cargo. To us it rather seems that it would have been better if there had been more men on the jury like the German juryman, who was rejected at the commencement of the trial, because he had ""read the articles in the Tribune, and the impression produced on his mind was that, if the evidence was clear, the jury ought to give in a verdict.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Impunity for Slave Traders.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Impunity for Slave Traders.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bc78aa5a-a4f7-5e1e-bcac-53d4be49c0b7,934,nyt://article/bc78aa5a-a4f7-5e1e-bcac-53d4be49c0b7,

In painting the people of the North, only two colors have been used, red and black; bloodthirsty and fiendish were they all. The colors have been put on with a prodigiously big brush, and very thick. All Northerners were Abolitionists, and all Abolitionists were -- well, for what they were, see, passim, the Southern Quarterly, DE BOW's Review, the Charlston Mercury, the Carolina Times, and every dingy gazette that saw the light from King's Mountain to Beaufort; listen to RHETT, to KFITT, to Gov. ADAMS, to Gen. QUATTLEBAUM, to Rev. Dr. THORNWILL, to MAXCY GREGG, and to all the heady orators of the bar-room; look at the statutes of the State, and see what penalties wait upon the detected Abolitionist; go to the plantations, and see how he is guarded against, as fire would be guarded against in a powder-magazine.

"About 8 o'clock yesterday morning, a German named SAMUEL HOFFMAN was stabbed to the heart with a dirk in the hands of Dr. MOSES LOWENBERG. The parties resided in the same house, at No. 141 First-avenue; Dr. LOWENBERG occupied the front basement as an office, and the murdered man, with his family, lived in the rear basement room. It seems that, yesterday morning, an altercation took place between the parties about the hall-door. Mr. HOFFMAN wished to have it shut, and the Doctor insisted that it should remain open. After the door had been opened and shut twice by the respective parties, Dr. LOWENBERG opened it a third time, and declared he would put it out of the power of HOFFMAN to shut it again, and immediately approached him as he was standing in the hallway, and, without further provocation, plunged a dirk into his breast four times, inflicting wounds so serious that he died in about five minutes afterwards. The only words that HOFFMAN uttered, after he received the stabs, were -- "" I am stabbed,"" and staggering into his room, he fell down on alounge, and soon expired. Dr. LOWENBERG was immediately arrested, and taken to the Seventh Precinct Station-house, where he is now detained to await the result of the Coroner's inquest. Coroner SCRIRMERwill hold an inquest at 8 1/2 o'clock this morning. The deceased was about thirty-five years of age, and has left a wife and two children in destitute circumstances. He was a carpenter by trade, and had been a resident of New-York about ten year. For the last eleven months he has been out of employment the most of the time. He has the reputation of being a quiet, inoffensive man, of industrious habits. The dirk used in the commission of the murder is 14 1/2 inches in length, from the point to the brass ferule near the handle, and had evidently belonged to a cane; but the officers, after diligent search, were unable to find the other portion. After the prisoner had been taken to the Station-house, he desired to send a messenger to Collector BARNEY, at the Custom-house, saying that he stood well there, and could get any amount of bail necessary. He is a politician of some note among the Germans of the Seventeenth Ward, and has hitherto taken an active part in the election of City officers.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/15/archives/murder-in-the-seventeenth-ward-a-man-stabbed-to-the-heart.html,,"About 8 o'clock yesterday morning, a German named SAMUEL HOFFMAN was stabbed to the heart with a dirk in the hands of Dr. MOSES LOWENBERG.

The question in dispute between the parties, which led to the quarrel, has not transpired, but OATMAN, on leaving the place immediately procured the arrest of FREDERICK BLACKMAN and AUGUSTUS ABELL, who were taken by officer WATERS to the Second Precinct Station-house. About 8 o'clock in the evening the officers having the prisoners in custody were served with a writ of habeas corpus, signed by City Judge MCCUNN, directing them to produce the bodies of BLACKMAN and ABELL, before him at his office, No. 29 Wall-street, yesterday morning, at 9 o'clock. The complainant not appearing promptly at the time specified, and Judge MCCUNN having duties to attend to in Court, the hearing of the case was postponed to 3 P.M. Meantime an examination of the writ by the complainant's counsel, CHAS. A. SPENCER, had discovered it to be a forgery, and under these circumstances the Assistant District-Attorney, Mr. ANTHON, was requested to be present at the examination. The complainant and the prisoners were promptly in attendance at the hour named, and Ex-Judge STUART appeared for the defence. Mr. WALLACE, of the County Clerk's Office, was asked to examine the writ and immediately pronounced the name of JOHN CLANCY signed thereto, a forgery. He further testified that the County Clerk's name was never signed to writs of habeus corpus except during office hours -- from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. The writ was obtained by a lawyer named JAMES G. GUMBLETON. Judge MCCUNN was charitable enough to suggest that the person, whoever he might be, that signed the County Clerk's name did it through ignorance, supposing that he had a right so to do, as in the case of executions; and Judge STUART even contended that the County Clerk's signature was not necessary. The writ also lacked the attestation of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and on the whole, the counsel for the defence admitted that it was defective in law and therefore null and void. Judge MCCUNN said that he indorsed the writ without particularly examining it, supposing it to be all right, but it was now evident that it was either a forgery or a blunder, and in either case was null and void, and he should therefore dismiss it and remand the prisoners to the custody of the officers. BLACKMAN and ABELL were then removed to the Tombs, where they spent last night, and will have an examination on a charge of assault and battery at the Jefferson Market Police Court this morning.

"The Duke of Argyle was entertained at a banquet by his tenantry, in Inverary, on the night of the 25th ult. In responding to the toast of his health, the Duke alluded to the American war. I see, he said, that there has been some fear expressed lately that the inconvenience which is likely to arise in this country from the contest in America is so great that there will be a pressure put upon the Government to interference in that contest, or at least to take some steps which may ultimately involve us in it. I have too high an opinion of the good sense and of the public principle of the people of this country to believe that any such pressure will be put upon the Government; and I must add, that I have too great confidence in the firmness and the public principle of the Government and Parliament of this country, to believe that they will be willing to submit to such pressure, if it were put upon them. It is our absolute duty, I need hardly tell you, to remain entirely neutral in that contest, [applause,] and not only is it our duty to remain neutral, as regards action, but I think it is to a very great extent our duty to abstain even from offering advice, though it might be conceived in a kind and friendly spirit. No good whatever can arise from offering such advice as that, for example, which was lately offered (I have no doubt with the best intentions) by the Emperor of Russia to the contending parties in America. The answer which the Americans will infallibly give to any such interference, will, however civilly expressed, virtually amount to this: ""We are very much obliged to you for your kind advice; we have no doubt that it is conceived in the best spirit and with the bust intentions; but there is a general rule in this world that every man should attend to his own affair; and there is this additional reason for doing so in the present case, that it is quite evident that you don't understand ours."" That is the answer which virtually the American they unworthy, or at least [???] and unimportant, Now, even we may think of that [???] in [???] to our American [???] we ought to [???].that no more tremendous issues were ever submitted to the dread arbitrament of war than those which are now submitted to it upon the American Continent. I do not cure whether we look at it from the Northern or from the Southern point of view. Take the mere question of what is called the right of secession. I know of no Government which has ever existed in the world which could possibly have admitted the right of secession from its own allegiance. There is a curious animal in Lochfyne, which I have sometimes dredged up from the bottom of the sea, and which performs the most extraordinary and unaccountable acts of suicide and self-destruction. It is a peculiar kind of star fish, which, when brought up from the bottom of the water, and when any attempt is made to take hold of it, immediately throws off all its arms -- its very centre breaks up, and nothing remains of one of the most beautiful forms in nature but a thousand wriggling fragments. Such undoubtedly would have been the fate of the American Union, if its Government had admitted what is called the right of secession. Gentlemen, I think we ought to admit, in fairness to the Americans, that there are some things worth fighting for, and that national existence is one of these. [Cheers] And then, gentlemen, if we go to the South -- If we look at the matter from the Southern point of view, difficult as it may be for us to do so -- I must say that I am not surprised at their conduet. If they believe -- as they loudly proclaim that they do believe -- that Slavery is not an evil which is to be tolerated only, and brought to an end as soon as possible, but a divine institution for the benefit of mankind, to be maintained, and, if possible, extended, and which, if it is assailed even in a single outpost, must be defended to the death, then, even though the citadel be not assailed, but only an important outwork -- then it is but natural that the South should rise in its defence, But of course, in this as in all other revolutions, those who take part in them must be judged finally by the moral verdict of mankind upon the justice of the cause which they have risen to assert. But whatever may be' our private sympathies, we, as a nation, must take no part whatever in this contest. Most earnestly do we trust and pray that it may be brought to a speedy end, and yet I confess that there is another wish which I think, in our mind, ought to stand even before this one -- and that is the wish that the end of this war, whenever it does come, be it soon or late, may be such as shall be worth the sacrifice and the cost -- such as shall tend to the civilization of the world, and promote the cause of human freedom.

It is our absolute duty, I need hardly tell you, to remain entirely neutral in that contest, [applause,] and not only is it our duty to remain neutral, as regards action, but I think it is to a very great extent our duty to abstain even from offering advice, though it might be conceived in a kind and friendly spirit. No good whatever can arise from offering such advice as that, for example, which was lately offered (I have no doubt with the best intentions) by the Emperor of Russia to the contending parties in America. The answer which the Americans will infallibly give to any such interference, will, however civilly expressed, virtually amount to this: ""We are very much obliged to you for your kind advice; we have no doubt that it is conceived in the best spirit and with the bust intentions; but there is a general rule in this world that every man should attend to his own affair; and there is this additional reason for doing so in the present case, that it is quite evident that you don't understand ours."" That is the answer which virtually the American they unworthy, or at least [???] and unimportant, Now, even we may think of that [???] in [???] to our American [???] we ought to [???].that no more tremendous issues were ever submitted to the dread arbitrament of war than those which are now submitted to it upon the American Continent. I do not cure whether we look at it from the Northern or from the Southern point of view. Take the mere question of what is called the right of secession. I know of no Government which has ever existed in the world which could possibly have admitted the right of secession from its own allegiance. There is a curious animal in Lochfyne, which I have sometimes dredged up from the bottom of the sea, and which performs the most extraordinary and unaccountable acts of suicide and self-destruction. It is a peculiar kind of star fish, which, when brought up from the bottom of the water, and when any attempt is made to take hold of it, immediately throws off all its arms -- its very centre breaks up, and nothing remains of one of the most beautiful forms in nature but a thousand wriggling fragments. Such undoubtedly would have been the fate of the American Union, if its Government had admitted what is called the right of secession. Gentlemen, I think we ought to admit, in fairness to the Americans, that there are some things worth fighting for, and that national existence is one of these. [Cheers] And then, gentlemen, if we go to the South -- If we look at the matter from the Southern point of view, difficult as it may be for us to do so -- I must say that I am not surprised at their conduet. If they believe -- as they loudly proclaim that they do believe -- that Slavery is not an evil which is to be tolerated only, and brought to an end as soon as possible, but a divine institution for the benefit of mankind, to be maintained, and, if possible, extended, and which, if it is assailed even in a single outpost, must be defended to the death, then, even though the citadel be not assailed, but only an important outwork -- then it is but natural that the South should rise in its defence, But of course, in this as in all other revolutions, those who take part in them must be judged finally by the moral verdict of mankind upon the justice of the cause which they have risen to assert. But whatever may be' our private sympathies, we, as a nation, must take no part whatever in this contest. Most earnestly do we trust and pray that it may be brought to a speedy end, and yet I confess that there is another wish which I think, in our mind, ought to stand even before this one -- and that is the wish that the end of this war, whenever it does come, be it soon or late, may be such as shall be worth the sacrifice and the cost -- such as shall tend to the civilization of the world, and promote the cause of human freedom.

"An inquest was held yesterday, by Coroner SCHIRMER, at the Seventeenth Precinct Station-house, upon the body of SAMUEL HOFFMAN, who was murdered on Thursday morning by Dr. MOSES LOWENBERG, at their residence, No. 141 First-avenue. The evidence taken substantiated the account which was given of the affair in yesterday's TIMES. Mrs. ELIZABETH HOFFMAN, wife of deceased, was the only person who witnessed the murder. She stated that Dr. LOWENBERG was in the habit of harboring females in his office, and that they often remained there the most of the night; that this was the case on the night previous to the murder. On Thursday morning, about 7 o'clock, witness went out on an errand, and when she returned she closed the front basement door. Dr. LOWENBERG immediately opened it, using great violence in so doing. Witness then remarked to her husband that the draft through the hall was very great; that it made their room -- which was the rear basement -- uncomfortably cold, and that she intended to close the door again. She did so, but the Doctor immediately reopened it with a violent jerk. Deceased then remarked that as the Doctor did this to tantalize them, he would reclose the door himself. He accordingly closed it, immediately after which the Doctor came out of his office in the front basement and stabbed deceased. He died almost immediately afterwards. The post-mortem examination revealed the fact that three stabs had been inflicted in the breast, one of which passed through the pericardium, terminating at the spinal column, and that this wound was the cause of his immediate death.

Of the immediate reasons which prompted the action of Gen. SUMNER, we are of course not advised. He doubtless proceeded upon something beyond a general impression as to the culpability of those gentlemen. Yet that impression might well have warranted the step merely as a precautionary measure. The three prisoners were open and declared sympathizers with secession. The Breckinridge interest in California had the three for its nucleus. Dr. GWIN, when in the United States Senate, lent himself to all the plots and plans of the men who have since precipitated the Union into the abyss of revolution; went home to California in order at once to procure his reelection to the Senate, and to secure the State to the Disunionists; and when defeated, returned to Washington to act as advocate, negotiator, go-between, of his Southern friends. His son, it will be remembered, he instantly removed from West Point, when the rebellion broke out, and sent him to join the rebel army. It has been currently stated in California, that all three gentlemen had gone to the Isthmus, not to proceed to the Atlantic coast, but indirectly to the Confederate States, there to join their fortunes with those of the insurrection. The circumstance of none of the three having procured ""through tickets"" seems to lend color to this theory; though indeed the fact may have suggested the theory. Our correspondent at Aspinwall states a circumstance, which, if verified, certainly creates suspicious it will be difficult for the prisoners -- if they are indeed prisoners, who have the liberty of the city unrestrained -- to thoroughly remove. Gen. SUMNER, with less of the detective than was essential to his new avocation, omitted to seize and search their baggage, when the arrest was made. It is stated that the three gentlemen took advantage of the omission to throw their papers overboard; and that these, with a carpet-bag of Dr. GWIN, were seen scattered in the wake of the ship. When the search was subsequently made, not a document, or letter, or scrap of paper, could be found in the luggage of either.

The Clerk entered judgment upon the verdict, it appears that a judgment had been recovered in December, 1857, against the Company on this policy, which was opened so far as to let the Company come in and defend, upon giving a bond with surities, and permitting the judgment and execution to stand to secure the plaintiff. The plaintiff moved to set aside the second judgment, as irregular and a nullity, and claims that his remedy was upon the original judgment, from which it was new too late for the Company to appeal.

"The new ocean steamship constitution, which has just been completed for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and intended for the passenger traffic between Panama and San Francisco, leaves to-day at noon, for Boston, from her anchorage opposite Canal-street. She has been chartered by Gen. BUTLER to convey a portion of his Division from Boston to some, as yet, unknown point on the Southern Coast. Her great capacity and, at the same time, her moderate draft of water when loaded, render her one of the most desirable steamers afloat for transport service. She will probably accommodate comfortably more passengers than any ship of equal tonnage which has ever been constructed in this country. By the use of her Sewell's condenser -- a patent arrangement -- over 30,000 gallons of fresh water daily can be made from salt water while lying in port. Besides her wheel condenser, site has a Normanby apparatus of large condensing capacity. Her tanks hold over 20,000 gallons. The ship is 350 feet in length, over all, 45 feet breadth of beam, not including paddle-boxes; 32 feet depth of hold and 40 feet deep from upper deck. Her engines were put in at the Novelty Works, under the supervision of Mr. EVERETT, and is a master-piece of work. The walking-beam weighs 30 tons. The cylinder is 105 inches in diameter, and stroke of piston 12 feet. Diameter of air-pump 4 feet 10 inches. Stroke, 6 feet. Diameter of circulating pump 4 feet 2 inches, stroke 4 feet 9 inches. She has 4 main boilers of 32 feet length and 13 feet 3 inches in diameter. There are also 4 single return boilers of 40 inches diameter, and one auxiliary boiler to drive the donkey-engine, giving her very great boiler capacity. The diameter of shaft is 23 inches, and diameter of paddle-wheels 40 feet out-side of buckets. She is in command of Capt. FLETCHER, one of the most experienced and popular of commanders, her engineer being Mr. VANDERBILT, long and favorably known in ocean steamship service. During the trial trip on Thursday the machinery worked with the greatest case, and gave entire satisfaction. She attained 14 revolutions with 20 pounds of steam. The Constitution was built by WM. H.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/17/archives/general-shermans-proclamationsev.html,,"eral of our journals take great exceptions to Gen. SHERMAN'S proclamation to the people of South Carolina, without any reason whatever that we can see. All proclamations of the kind are usually little more than verbiage, having about as much effect and significance as those issued by the redoubtable WOUTER VON TWILLER in the veritable and early history of Manhattan. A speech is the part of the ceremony of every General in assuming command. That of Gen. SHERMAN clearly copies the position of Government, which probably does not intend to arm the slave or disturb the domestic relations of the South, unless such arming and interference becomes necessary to put down the rebellion. That such arming will be resorted to is clearly inferrible from the General's speech. In fact, he affirms this in language as clear as an officer in his position ought to use. His proclamation could hardly be couched in terms more offensive to South Carolina. Instead of being unmeaning to her, it will incite her rage and animosity to the utmost, and very speedily bring about that state of things in which the extra muskets Mr. CAMERON tells us he put aboard the fleet will be speedily used. The language of the chief of the War Department, who controls not only the speeches but the action of Gen. SHERMAN, has no ambiguity whatever. We presume the General's conduct will only reflect that of the Secretary. We see no discrepancy between them. It might have been well for Gen. SHERMAN to have made no proclamation whatever. But such is the custom. If he made one, it is certainly the better way to deal in platitudes, and act his intentions, instead of bragging about them. Successful men seldom tell us what they are going to do. They first see whether success is possible. To go quietly at work arming a few regiments of slaves, will strike the rebels with tenfold more terror than threats of this purpose. This is unquestionably Gen. SHERMAN's plan. He is not only in harmony with the Administration, but with the sentiments of those who now seem so eager to censure him.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GENERAL SHERMAN'S PROCLAMATION.--Sev"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""GENERAL SHERMAN'S PROCLAMATION.--Sev"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/341cbf39-06de-5ac9-9bb6-f31ce8d707c2,357,nyt://article/341cbf39-06de-5ac9-9bb6-f31ce8d707c2,

CHARLES WILKES, who so neatly nabbed SLIDELL and MASON, is a name known both in navigation and in science. He was born in this State in 1805, and originally entered the naval service of his country in 1818, at the carly age of 13 years. In 1838, having previously distinguished himself by his scientific ability, he received from the American Government the command of a naval expedition intended to explore the countries bordering on the Pacific and Southern Oceans. His command consisted of two sloops-of-war, a brig and two tenders, and he himself had the grade of Captain. Leaving here shortly after his appointment, he doubled Cape Horn, crossed over to Polynesia, Van Dieman's Land and Australia, advancing as high as the 61st degree of south latitude; he then visited the Feejee Islands and Borneo, and returned to New-York in 1842, after having visited Singapore and the Cape of Good Hope. This memorable expedition of four years was fertile in useful observations, which Capt. WILKES recounted in a very able work in five octavo volumes, entitled A Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition. In 1848 the Geographical Society of London presented him with a gold medal, as a token of their appreciation of his labors. He has also, since then, published a work entitled Western America, which contains valuable statistical details and geographical facts and maps relating to California and Oregon. Commodore WILKES received his present commission in 1855. He has been in the service altogether forty-three years. Ten of these years he has been on sea service; twenty-six engaged on shore or other duty, and seven years unemployed. For some years, latterly, he has been assigned to special duty near Washington. He is now returning from the Coast of Africa with the United States steamer San Jacinto. On his way home he found orders to cruise around the coast of the West Indies to look out for privateers or vessels attempting to run the blockade, which duty he has been performing for the past six weeks. While engaged in this business he fell in with the vessel containing the two rebel Plenipos. The whole country now rings with applause of his bold action.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CAPTAIN CHARLES WILKES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CAPTAIN CHARLES WILKES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5cab3c8e-016b-5a34-9329-9e97a3cb2bde,369,nyt://article/5cab3c8e-016b-5a34-9329-9e97a3cb2bde,

SLIDELL and MASON, recently of the Senate of the United States, the most prominent and influential actors in the rebellion, and on their way to England and France, to represent the rebels at the Courts of these countries. The capture of Beaufort may have created a deeper and more lasting impression, from a consciousness of the important results accomplished, but really no satisfaction is equal to that experienced when base and treacherous knaves meet their deserts. If we were to search the whole of Rebeldom, no persons so justly obnoxious to the North, could have been found as those just caught. DAVIS himself has some redeeming qualities; MASON and SLIDELL, none. The former is arrogant imperious and ignorant, treating, when in the Senate, his associates with unmeasured scorn, contempt, and constantly heaping contumely upon the free labor and social system of the North. In personal bearing, he was an Eastern satrap, by some curious anomaly transferred into the Senate of a Republic. A thorough enemy of the Union, he used his position simply for its destruction. SLIDELL is a far abler man, and would be a much more dangerous one, did not a reputation for almost every species of dishonesty greatly weaken his influence. His sobriquet, even at home, among his own constituents, is Baron Plaquemine, from the origination by him of the notorious frauds in that parish which, in 1844, gave the vote of the State to Mr. POLK instead of Mr. CLAY. For almost the entire Administration of Mr. BUCHANAN he was one of its ruling spirits, and the bosom friend of the President, and, more than any other man, the promoter of the rebellion. The two rogues fell out, however, near the close of Mr. BUCHANAN's term. Mr. SLIDELL was as implacable as Mr. BUCHANAN, and a very fierce quarrel grew up between them. He was of the clique of those infamous characters which so long controlled the Government of this country, and whose ruin he sought by associating with it his own infamy, as the snake covers his victim with his own nauseous slime as the necessary condition of swallowing it. Both are sworn enemies of order and law -- of constitutional Government -- of free labor -- of human progress. They belong to an age in which the basest of passions and motives bore sway. For seeking to restore such an age they fled their country, and are now happily the prisoners of the very Government they sought to overthrow.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Capture of Slidell and Mason.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Capture of Slidell and Mason.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/681de256-acce-57ec-b38d-d70c2856f2bd,954,nyt://article/681de256-acce-57ec-b38d-d70c2856f2bd,

Few persons in any nation arrive at a rational comprehension of the peculiarities of foreigners. The closer the relationship between the peoples of two countries, the more apparent is that ignorance of each other, which, thinking it knows all, learns nothing. Never was this more clearly demonstrated than in the case of England and the United States. Of a common origin and tongue, separated by scarce a century of independent organization, almost identical in variety of race, and of social, political and religious aspiration, students in the same schools of philosophy and literature; exchanging residence, correspondence, news; eternally shaking hands across the ocean; saluting, mingling, amalgamating; yet still seemingly as utter strangers at least so far as English insight into our real nature and disposition is concerned -- as if no more intimate bonds of community existed between them than between the Esquimaux and Chinese. The mischief of the matter is, that coming as it were of the same household, they imagine they have an intuitive perception of our character and genius, and that they are the legitimate exponents to the people of other countries of what about us and our institutions stands in need of elucidation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'International Kinsfolk.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'International Kinsfolk.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9da30a7f-7838-55b6-a468-5aa2e95a4569,1458,nyt://article/9da30a7f-7838-55b6-a468-5aa2e95a4569,

"The latest news from England touching the indispensable staple, is extremely contradictory; touching the state of business and the condition of the people in the cotton manufacturing districts, it is decidedly bad.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/17/archives/news-from-and-for-england.html,,"The latest news from England touching the indispensable staple, is extremely contradictory; touching the state of business and the condition of the people in the cotton manufacturing districts, it is decidedly bad. The London Times and the Calcutta Englishman are diametrically opposed to each other as to the probability of an adequate supply of cotton being obtainable from India. The Thunderer asserts that ""India, which, properly stimulated, can produce all things, is bestirring herself to supply"" England's ""necessities in the article of cotton. What has been long certain in theory is now about to be shown in practice -- that with American seed and European supervision, we may obtain any quantity of cotton from India that Manchester will pay for."" It would certainly be hazardous to assign limits to India's cotton-growing capacity, had she American seed, European supervision and European capital; but that is not now the question. The question now is, whether India is at present ""bestirring herself to supply"" England's ""necessities in the article of cotton,"" as the Thunderer maintains. The Englishman, which is published in the metropolis of India, not at ten thousand miles distance from the country of which it speaks, boldly affirms that she is not doing so to the extent supposed and needed. The manifesto issued by Manchester and her Cotton Supply Association, says our Anglo-Indian authority, has inspired little confidence in the cotton-growing districts. The zemindars, planters and ryots, who were almost ruined by American competition, and whose screw and cleaning-houses are now dilapidated, are very unwilling to extend the cultivation of the required crop without receiving a guarantee that a similar disaster shall not again occur, their reluctance to make the venture being enhanced by the fact that 50,000 bales of Cotton are at present rotting in the depots of the Ganges for want of purchasers! Such, in substance, is the statement of the Englishman, and few, we think who really desire to know the truth will hesitate to prefer it to the vague and rhetorical assertion of the British, journal. But how could England have the effrontery to give to the Indian agriculturist a guarantee which she would be constrained to violate the moment our civil war had ended? The Manchester manufacturer would surely not tolerate a discriminative duty on American Cotton in order to secure a remunerative price to the grower of the Oriental article. The Manchester manufacturer would surely not consent to pay an exorbitant price for Indian Cotton, if an article equally good and much cheaper were at hand. Should the adequate extension, then, of the cultivation of the Cotton plant in India depend on the granting of the guarantee alluded to, we may safely conclude that the extended cultivation will not take place; and this, in despite of the reckless and rhetorical assertions of the Times, seems to be the prevalent opinion in England -- for the panic spreads and business becomes more stagnant, and the interests of both capitalists and operatives grow more and more paralyzed. The accounts from the manufacturing districts are, indeed, very disheartening. The short-time and total-suspension movement is now in operation everywhere. Those mill owners who have not closed altogether, have put their hands off with half work. In the Manchester district alone there are nearly 100,000 people already out of employment, while one-fourth more are receiving relief from the Union than at the corresponding period of last year. Winter too approaches with his attendant hardships to aggravate the sufferings of the distressed and destitute. Such is the gloomy intelligence last brought from England. But there is balm in Gilead. As we write there is news on its way to England which will calm her fears and allay her sorrows. The success of our Naval Expedition will enable the American Government to do more toward supplying England's want, and alleviating the sufferings of Eng. land's people, than all the zemindars of India could effect. What neither the arts nor the arms of England or Englishmen could accomplish, we will presently achieve for them. What neither Asia, nor Africa, nor distant Australia could yield to them, we will presently provide them with. Northern troops now garrison Southern fortresses, are now encamped, on Southern soil, have now possession of a Southern port, whither Britons will soon be invited to come for the purchase and shipment of that material which will again make busy the mills of their manufacturers, and gladden, with the prospect of returning work and plenty, the hearts of their toilers. This is the cheering and unlooked-for intelligence which America has sent to England. Its announcement will banish anxiety, apprehension and panic from the minds of her people. Let us hope that it will also bring Englishmen to a sense of their erroneous opinions, and convince them, even at the eleventh hour, that their own true interests, and those of their country, are inseparably bound up with the speedy and complete triumph of the North in the pending war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'News From and For England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'News From and For England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af28c242-cc94-5acb-b3dc-aeb2a7991aa0,827,nyt://article/af28c242-cc94-5acb-b3dc-aeb2a7991aa0,

MASON and SLIDELL, who recently succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the blockading fleet, and escaped to Gardenas on board the steamer Theodora. They were captured by a party from on board the United States steam-frigate San Jacinto, Capt. WILKES, recently from the coast of Africa, but which for six weeks past has been cruising among the West India Islands. Capt. WILKES, it appears, received intelligence that the two rebels had embarked on board the English mail-steamer at Bermuda, and determined to capture them. He accordingly overhauled the steamer in the Bermuda Channel, and sent a messenger on board to demand their surrender. This was refused, with the intimation that there was not force enough to take them. Capt. WILKES accordingly sent an additional force, and at the same time put the San Jacinto into a position to enforce his demands, when the surrender was made. The two Commissioners, with their secretaries, were then transferred to the San Jacinto, together with all their papers, and they reached Fortress Monroe on Friday, when it was determined to bring them to New-York. The name of the British steamer from which they were taken is given as the Trent. Another account, received by way of Halifax, states that she was the Fingal which had transferred her cargo of munitions of war to the Nashville, taking in exchange the rebel Commissioners. This statement is disproved, however, by the announcement that the Fingal has arrived at Savannah with the cargo shipped at Greenock.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db6195b9-ab95-582f-86d4-3ab2f1137527,1271,nyt://article/db6195b9-ab95-582f-86d4-3ab2f1137527,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/18/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"We published yesterday morning the announcement of the capture of the rebel Commissioners, Messrs. MASON and SLIDELL, who recently succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the blockading fleet, and escaped to Cardenas on board the steamer Theodora. They were captured by a party from on board the United States steam-frigate San Jacinto, Capt. WILKES, recently from the coast of Africa, but which, for six weeks past has been cruising among the West India Islands. Capt. WILKES, it appears, while coaling at Havana, learned that the rebel Commissioners were to leave on the 7th, on board the English mail steamer Trent, and determined to capture them. He accordingly overhauled the steamer in the Bahama Channel, and sent a messenger on board to demand their surrender. After some demur on their part, the Commissioners, with their Secretaries, were transferred to the San Jacinto, together with their papers, which are understood to be very voluminous. Capt. WILKES offered also to take on board the ladies and children accompanying the party, but they preferred to proceed to England on board the Trent. The San Jacinto then proceeded to Fortress Monroe, whence it was determined, after consultation between Capt. WILKES and Gen. WOOL, to bring the distinguished prisoners to New-York, while dispatches announcing the capture were forwarded to Washington. An account of the arrest, received in Halifax by the English mail steamer from Bermuda, stated that the steamer on board which the arrest was made was the Fingal, which had transferred her cargo of munitions of war to the Nashville, taking in exchange the rebel Commissioners. This statement is disproved, however, by the announcement that the Fingal has arrived at Savannah with the cargo shipped at Greenock.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/756c92cc-46ec-5c06-9d95-e24d7f2586b4,1486,nyt://article/756c92cc-46ec-5c06-9d95-e24d7f2586b4,

"The notorious prisoner, FELIX SANCHEZ, who for the last three or four years has been confined in the Tombs, attempted, on Sunday afternoon, to take the life of JACOB TRUEHEART, alias MYERA, who acts as one of the tier boys in the City Prison. It will be remembered that SANCHEZ was arrested, between three and four years ago, for the murder of his father-in-law. He was subsequently tried upon the charge, and convicted. The case was appealed, and after much delay a new trial was ordered by the appellate Court, but for some reason the alleged murderer has never been a second time brought to trial.

SANCHEZ made some tough reply to this, but nothing further passed between them till about 3 o'clock P.M., when the doors of the cells were unbarred for the prisoners to receive their meals. When SANCHEZ's cell-door was opened, he at once rushed out upon TRUEHEART, making a deadly thrust at his heart with one of the blades of a pair of tailor's, shears, which was sharp pointed, and had a rag wound round the handle, to enable him to hold and wield it with effect. TRUEHEART had the presence of mind to throw the weapon upwards as it approached his breast, but it struck his right arm, and inflicted a serious wound.

"MORRIS MEYER, a man of high social position, about twenty-three years of age, was arrested in this City yesterday by direction of Superintendent KENNEDY. Mr. KENNEDY received a telegram from the State Department in the early part of the day, requesting him to arrest the young man, and convey him at once to Fort Lafayette. Pursuant to these orders, he sent officers immediately to the store of Mr. MEYER, in the upper part of Broadway, where he was found, and conveyed to Police Headquarters.

J.S. INSKIP, Chaplain of the Fourteenth Regiment N.Y.S.M., and a liberal collection was taken up to furnish some necessary articles for the comfort of the men. Mr, INSKIP glanced at the carcer of the regiment from the time it left Brooklyn in May last, up to the present - at the advance post in Virginia. He claimed, what no one ever doubted, that the regiment had done its whole duty, and the audience might rest assured they would remain in the held until the close of the war. The statements made were for the most part interesting, and gave those present a better idea of camp life than they had before entertained. The Fourteenth, with their military duties, mingle the following exercises: Sunday morning and evening, preaching in ""Fowler Chapel"" - a tent; and in the afternoon a prayer meeting is held at the same place. The church is under the management of twenty trustees - composed of men of all professions, and no profession of faith, and the arrangement if, such that every, thing works harmoniously, and a great deal of good has already been accomplished, partially through this means, and we presume also from the fact that Mr. INSKIP, when the regiment first wont into the field, took upon himself the urduous duty of doing all the necessary swearing that was to be done. On Monday evening a temperance meeting is held in the tent. The society new numbers about 160, including about 20 whe, when they entered the regiment, were drunkards. Tuesday evening a literary and debating society meets at the same place. Wednesday and Thursday evenings prayer - meetings are held. Friday evening a concert is given, and on Saturday evening the ""Chaplain's Levee"" is held, when there is singing, instrumental music, declamation, and the affair winds up with a smoke - the only occasion on which smoking is allowed in the tent. An admission fee of one stick of wood for the chaplain is sometimes charged for admission to this entertainment. As may well be imagined, the men of the regiment are pretty much all of the time occupied between drill, singing, praying and speaking, and accordingly in good spirits. The men, however, are sadly in need of many little comforts which they cannot obtain for themselves, such as flannels, stockings, mittens, &c.; and to urge the furnishing of them is the special mission of Mr. INSKIP at this time. Contributions can be sent to WM. M. BURNET, No. 19 Henry-street, and they will be forwarded immediately.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; The Fourteenth Regiment.

The business thus became a mere scramble, entailing infinite annoyance upon the Secretaries and Heads of Bureaus, and leading to practices in the highest degre derogatory to the character and position of the Press. It became dangerous to leave a public document upon any Secretary's desk, lest it should mysteriously disappear and make its first appearance in the columns of some enterprising newspaper. Some journals, much more zealous for news than for the preservation of their self-respect, devoted themselves to the purchase of special favors in this way, by filling their columns with fulsome flattery of special members of the Government who had them to bestow, and unscruplous abuse of others who might decline thus to traffic for their own advantage in documents belonging to the Government and the people at large.

Martin, of the Second Precinct Police. Messrs. Britton and Jenks appeared as counsel for the prisoner, and District-Attorney Winslow conducted the prosecution. A jury was obtained before the panel of eighty, which had been drawn for the Court, was exhausted, and the trial was proceeded with without any vexatious delay. The facts elicited from witnesses placed on the stand by the people, were substantially as follows: On the night of the 5th of August last, the prisoner attempted to break into house No. 130 Adams-street, occupied by Mr. Sanxay; several residents in the neighborhood, and among others, Mr. Anderson, witnessed his proceedings and made an attempt to arrest him; when Curtis found that he was discovered, he ran from Adams into High-street, through High to Washington-street, and through the latter street as far as Prospect-street, when his further progress was stopped by Officer David H. Martin, of the Second Precinct Police; the citizens who had followed the fugitive, crying, ""stop thief,"" soon came and found the prisoner and the officer clinched and upon the ground. Upon raising and seperating them, it was found that Martin had received a mortal wound in the right side of his neck, from the effects of which he died within a very few minutes. Several persons were near enough to see that Curtis made the stab before the officer used his club. On the person of accused was found a complete set of burglars' tools, skeleton keys, false whiskers, &c. The testimony was nearly all introduced yesterday, and counsel will sum up this morning.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Murder Trial. The Newfoundland Telegraph Line.

It is frequently said that the United States has denied the right of search, -- that we went to war with England in 1812 to resist it, -- and that we have denounced it ever since. This is a mistake, -- growing out of the confounding of two things which are entirely distinct. We have denied the right of search in time of peace for the enforcement of any municipal or treaty regulation. We have denied the right of England to search our ships to see whether we had English sailors on board, or whether they were going after a cargo of slaves, in time of peace. But we have never denied the right of search for contraband in time of war. All our writers on law, -- all our statesmen and diplomatists, have expressly admitted that right. Chief-Justice MARSHALL styled it ""a belligerent right which cannot be called in question.""

When a particular result is desired, a conclusion that favors it is very apt to be adopted with very little examination or reason. The wish to have it so supplies the place of proofs. But these, it happens, are directly opposed to the positions assumed. What does the North suffer by waiting? Only the burdens of the war. Its internal and foreign trade was never more active. Labor is everywhere free, productive and well rewarded. Our banks were never making money faster; our railroads were never transporting so much freight, or earning so much; the North never had more bountiful crops, and never got so much money for them; even the vast burdens of the war, the expenditures reaching $1,000,000 per day, are not felt to be a burden.

All this cannot justly be found fault with. But then it is hardly the thing that was to be expected after what we have heard. Every man, woman, child, and chattel, in the Rattlesnake State, was to wage war to the death with the invader at every footstep of his progress, and particularly at his first footstep on to the consecrated soil. The favorite figure was that of a defiant Carolinian, armed cap-a-pie, standing in the last ditch, with a black flag waving over him, while he waged war to the knife, the knife to the hilt, and (as a secession newspaper has it) thence to the shoulder, shouting every now and then, No quarter!",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Black Flags and Last Ditches.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Black Flags and Last Ditches.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e45ec50-041c-569f-a92c-8be3e0a04e40,420,nyt://article/6e45ec50-041c-569f-a92c-8be3e0a04e40,

"The weather having become favorable for curing. Pork packing has been generally carried on to some extent towards the close of the past week. The principal business done has been for the English market, though there has been a steady and remunerative demand for Mess and Clear Pork for shipment to Canada. The Milwaukee packers still purchasing in our market, and the Eastern shippers being moderate purchasers, together with the receipts of Hogs being smaller than was anticipated, prices have been forced higher than at any other point in the West, and the pens have been daily emptied at advancing rates, closing firm at $2 70 to $2 90 gross, with occasional sales at $3. The receipts for the past week and the corresponding period the past three years sum up as follows, viz.: In 1858, live 24,944, dressed 5,347; in 1859, live 15,613, dressed 2,624; in 1860, live 23,448, dressed 307; and in 1861, live 16,245, dressed 42. The low aggregate of our receipts the present week is owing to the fact that the farmers, having plenty of Corn to feed their Hogs, have preferred to keep them on, thinking that the mildness of the weather would prevent packers from operating freely in either live or dressed. As the present rates offer most remunerative returns to the farmers and drovers, we shall, doubtless, have a large increase in our receipts the present week. The rapid decline in Hog products in the New-York market has warned our packers of the danger of present prices for Hogs, and many of them express their intention of allowing their houses to lie idle, rather than incur an almost inevitable loss by continuing packing. Mess Pork has sold freely, at $10 25@$10 50, and Clear, at $12, the principal purchasers being for shipment to Canada. Many of our packers are making Prime Pork, with a view to the consumption of the Shoulders; it is offered at $7 bbl. Prime Mess Pork is offered at $9 50@$10 bbl. without finding buyers. Rump Pork at $6 50@$7. Prime Lard has been sold to a considerable extent for shipment to England, at 7c., and in some instances of straight brands a shade higher; No. 1 has also sold largely, at 6 1/2c. Sales of Yellow Grease have been reported at 5c., but this is considered far beyond the market. There is no demand for Cut Meats, and no quotations yet current. Green Hams and Shoulders have been sold at 3 3/4c. and 2c. lb. For hams there is but a very limited demand, but Shoulders sell freely at quotations. The principal business for the week has been in English Middles, and the principal transaction the sale of 500 boxes Long Boneless Middles, on private terms, (understood to be 5c. lb.) The transactions in Cumberland Cut, Long and Short Middles have not been large, the packers being careless to offer till the price of hogs becomes more settled. The quotations may, however, be given at 4 1/2c. for Cumberland Cut, 5c. for Long and 5 1/4c.@5 7/8c. for Short Rib in. The parking of hogs to the present time sums up about 20,000 head. Only ten houses, however, are yet at work. The market for beef cattle closes dull and lower, the receipts for the last two days being very large. Packing qualities range from $1 50@$2 50 for choice. Extra Mess has been selling at $9 and Mess at $8. No sales of Tierce Beef reported. Prime Tallow is firm and in demand, with large sales at 8c.@8 1/4c.

"A BOLD THEFT -- ARREST OF THE THIEVES. -- Thursday afternoon a man named HENRY MALLON entered the sugar store of RAMSEY CROOKS, No. 57 Front-street, and asked to look at a directory. While he was examining it, a confederate came in and began pricing sapar. Mr. CROOKS was the only person in the store at the time besides these two men.

On Friday, the 18th inst., it will be recollected, FLOYD made a demonstration against the position of Gen. ROSECRANS, probably with a view to forcing his way through, and forming a junction with the rebel forces in Southeastern Kentucky. By cutting a road through between the mountains, he succeeded in reaching a position, which in a measure commanded the New River, and the National camp at Tompkins Farm, and also the Kanawha River below the junction, together with the road running across the Gauley and along the opposite bank, communicating with Gen. BENHAM's camp further down the Kanawha. He kept up a continuous fire with shot and shell during Friday, but did very little damage -- the only effect being to stop temporarily the transit of baggage-wagons along the road. Meantime the National forces were not idle. During Friday and Friday night they succeeded in getting one or two batteries into position, and on Saturday morning opened upon the rebels with such effect, that by 2 o'clock P.M. they were forced to retire, finding the locality too warm to be agreeable. The fighting was again renewed on Sunday morning, but with similar results. This desultory skirmishing seems to have been continued for several days, FLOYD being driven successively from all his positions excepting Cotton Hill, and this he was finally forced to abandon, measures having been taken to cut off his retreat, by throwing National troops across the New-River at Camp McNeil and across the Kanawha at Camp Hattleston, and he not caring to await so unpleasant an end of his Kanawha campaign. He retreated on the night of the 10th inst., and his movement was not discovered until it was too late to overtake him, although an effort was made to do so. Cotton Hill and all the other positions in the vicinity recently occupied by the enemy are now in the possession of our troops.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""OPERATION IN THE KANAWHA VALLEY.; The Great Kanawha, Gauley and New Rivers The Scene of Floyd's Repulse."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""OPERATION IN THE KANAWHA VALLEY.; The Great Kanawha, Gauley and New Rivers The Scene of Floyd's Repulse."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f860a85b-9d63-5bba-aef1-d989bdc2eefa,350,nyt://article/f860a85b-9d63-5bba-aef1-d989bdc2eefa,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/24/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"We publish this morning a full report of JEFF. DAVIS' Message to the rebel Legislature, contained in the Richmond papers of Wednesday last. He finds cause for congratulation in what he calls the success of the Confederate arms, and declares that in men, military means and financial condition, the Confederate States are much stronger now than when the struggle commenced. He falsely alleges, as a reason for the invasion of Kentucky, that the National forces were about to enter Tennessee over Kentucky soil. He declares that the Union can never be reconstructed, as the causes which primarily induced a separation have been strengthened; characterizes the nature of the hostilities on the part of the United States as barbarous, and denounces the National soldiers as incendiaries and robbers. He glosses over the financial condition of the rebel States in a very hasty and imperfect manner -- evidently considering it a very delicate subject to handle -- and is disposed to apologize for imperfect mail facilities. He of course sees in the capture of Messrs. MASON and SLIDELL on board a British vessel a cause for war between the United States and Great Britain -- declaring that the seizure might with equal propriety have been made in the streets of London. The blockade he pronounces to be totally inefficient, and says that sufficient proof of this fact will be furnished at the proper time. When the proper time will come he does not state, but it will probably be after the arrival on the Southern coast of the ""stone fleet,"" which recently sailed from New-London. On the whole, Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS makes a good case for his Southern readers -- his Northern readers he probably cares as little about as he does about telling the truth. He seems, however, to have forgotten to mention the little affair at Port Royal, as we cannot find one word about it in his Message.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2374ec2c-14d0-53db-a056-d95be1339404,962,nyt://article/2374ec2c-14d0-53db-a056-d95be1339404,

Now they leave their ship's side and bear away toward the school of whales spied out by the man on the ""crosstrees."" The little or ""calf whales"" are a sure indication to the sailor that the mother is not far off, for it is a proverb with them that the whale, unlike a fashionable mother, never loses sight of her child. Now the excitement in the boat is intense, as lance after lance is buried in the body of the monster, after all, only sufficient to give it a fright, and cause it to sink out of sight, (for the purpose, probably, of contemplating the position of affairs,) for in some twenty or thirty minutes the continent of a back is seen rising at a distance, and now the chase commences in good earnest, lasting often two days and a night.

"The explosion at DUPONT's powder mills, near Wilmington, which was distinctly heard in this city on Wednesday morning, occurred at 11 o'clock. The casualties are said to be three or four men killed, named SAMUEL RUSSELL, CHARLES MULHRIEN and JOHN VIZIER. A fourth man was killed, name unknown. The remains were so blackened and mutilated that their friends could not recognize them. MARTIN DOLAN was near one of the mills, and narrowly escaped. The explosion was the most powerful since the explosion of the powder-wagons in Fourteenth-street, Wilmington, some years ago. It shook many houses in Wilmington violently, and was sensible heard and felt at Point Breeze and Wilmington, but was not felt or heard at Newcastle. The dwelling-houses of the proprietors of the estate are said to be very much damaged, and considerable work and time will be required to put them in repair. The operatives in a manufactory on the opposite side of the Brandywine Creek were terribly affected by the concussion; one of the girls is said to have died from it.

The prostitution of the Senate to the objects of latent, but now patent treason; the character systematically given to its legislation; the predominance of the embryo rebels upon all Committees; the warfare, direct and covert, levied upon every Democrat who, like BENTON, declared against the evident purpose of secession: these were the principal agencies which rendered disunion possible, and neutralized all the counteractive influences of a Republican House of Representatives. Of the men who, in the Senate, gave themselves most unreservedly and arrogantly to this preliminary business, MASON, SLIDELL, GWIN and GREEN, stood foremost -- the latter having rather the advantage of the others in swagger, insolence and shamelessness. That after the mischief was done, and the breach made irreparable, the Missouri Senator became sufficiently alarmed at the impending result to throw his influence at home into the scale of DOUGLAS for the Presidency, in preference to BRECKINRIDGE, serves in no degree to palliate his previous wrong-doing; for the advocacy of DOUGLAS in Missouri was quite as serviceable to the cause of treason as a vote for BRECKINRIDGE in Virginia.

"COMPLICITY OF THE CHURCH PARTY WITH SPAIN. -- Our latest intelligence from Mexico is not of so sombre a character as usual. The total defeat of MARQUEZ has given additional stability to the Constitutional Government, and the prospect of having peace and order reestablished throughout the Republic is becoming more cheering. Rumors of the contemplated European expedition have reached the Capital, but seem to have caused very little apprehension. Certain Mexicans think that if the Allies are unreasonable, the people will arouse themselves, and that, though on the sea-board the country will be powerless, in the interior the invaders could be put to trouble. The men, however, who hold to this opinion must know little of the real state of matters. They fancy, evidently, that the masses are unanimous, and that if Mexico were assailed, all would turn out to defend her liberties. But would such be the case? The complicity of the leaders of the Church Party with Spain promises little for the patriotism of that faction; and the recent arrest of MUNOZ LEDO, MIRAMON's Minister of State, has placed the treason and guilt of those leaders beyond question.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/25/archives/new-publications.html,,"The military complexion of the day is caught up and mirrored very faithfully by our publishers. Of the new books published, there are very few which do not either directly or remotely bear on the war. The popular craving is to sniff battles, in books, if no nearer. We wish to be told stories of armies and of sieges; the dull themes of peace have lost all charm to stir the blood. SORIBNER avails himself of this military moment to publish new editions of two very well known works, by JOEL T. HEADLEY, The Old Guard of Napoleon, and The Life of Havelock. It would be impossible to tell the story of the Old Guard in an uninteresting way. Mr. HEADLEY's graphic pen has lent to it an interest passing that of romance. Were it not for the evidence of history, the render would refuse to believe that such men as composed this famous guard ever existed, classing them with the fabulous heroes of antiquity. It were worth a life to see them in one of their marvelous charges, sweeping as a huge wave crested with steel across the field, dashing the cannoneers from opposing batteries, and hurling battalions out of their path as the surf does pebbles. Never was the Guard called upon until there was need of their services -- never did they fail to respond to the call. When his army wavered under a scathing fire, and the tide of battle seemed turning in favor of the enemy, then it was that NAPOLEON would call upon his ""column of granite"" to redeem the day. And they generally did it. Through the thickest of the iron hail, let it beat fiercely as it might, they bore their conquering eagles; and their bear-skin caps, wherever they appeared, were an assurance of victory. Only once did they fail in turning the tide of battle at the critical moment, and then they did not surrender. Faithful to their boast, they died. Many a reader, as he hangs over their achivements and thinks of the sore need our country has for such iron hearts will sigh, ""Oh, for an Old Guard."" In regard to Mr. HEADLEY's other book, a Christian soldier is such a rarity in actual life, that the character of that noble soldier and accomplished gentleman, HAVELOCK, would interest for its novelty alone.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0ecf5a7e-e5f8-5961-903a-f21ec436203d,1931,nyt://article/0ecf5a7e-e5f8-5961-903a-f21ec436203d,

The ingenuity with which the Herald has prosecuted this incendiary work is only rivaled by its pertinacity. It has seized upon every possible occasion, -- and resorted to every conceivable device, -- to sting the sensibilities, wound the pride, repel the sympathy and alarm the fears of the English people. It began by recommending, day after day, the instant march of an army into Canada, under the preposterous and shallow pretext that the South would instantly join us in such an enterprise, and that thus we should end the rebellion. It has announced repeatedly that England's opposition to Slavery justifies us in declaring war against her, -- that we are already at war, -- that we have now a military force on foot which it would be folly not to use to crush her rivalry, -- that we shall certainly thus employ it, after our domestic rebellion is suppressed, if not before, -- and that all the arguments we need offer her on any subject of difference are cannon-balls and men-of-war. And in all this the Herald pretends to speak the sentiments of the Government, -- claiming that ""Mr. SEWARD and the Herald"" are acting in harmony on this subject, and demanding that all who oppose this policy or doubt its wisdom shall be sent to Fort Lafayette, as enemies of the Government and especially hostile to the Administration.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Incendiary Press Aid and Comfort to the Rebels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Incendiary Press Aid and Comfort to the Rebels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22bf1ace-8a86-5756-933f-92079a68bec9,1213,nyt://article/22bf1ace-8a86-5756-933f-92079a68bec9,

"The Scotia, the latest and most magnificent of the line of Cunard Royal Mail steamers, is approaching completion on the Clyde. The general dimensions of the ship are as follows: Length of keel and forerake, 360 feet; length over all, 400 feet; breadth of mould, 47 feet; and depth, 32 feet. In the construction of the hull, the most modern improvements have been introduced, towards enabling her to afford as great resisting powers as possible to the combined influences of storms and winds. The keel is composed of several bars of iron, each 35 feet in length, firmly joined together by scarves, the whole being 14 inches in depth, and 4 inches thick. The framework is of the strongest description. Amidships it consists of plates of 4-angle iron, running up to the gunwale and towards the stem and stern, while the other portions of the hull are constructed in the usual way. Owing to the arrangement of the plates, the framework is very heavy, but the amount of strength secured will be increasedly great. The frame of the bow is built diagonally, so that in the case of a collision, or contact with a rock or iceberg, the strain would fall upon the very strongest material of which the ship is composed. The Scotia would thus have a double good chance of safety, and of a successful resistance to accident, while other vessels would be in peril. In addition also to the kelsons and girders of a usual frame, others of a novel character have been introduced in order to give a superior resisting power. The Scotia is not clinker built, but the plates are laid on alternately, and in such a manner as to impart wonderful compactness and solidity to the hull. The plates at the keel are 1-16th of an inch in thickness; at the bottom of the ship they are 15-16ths of an inch, from the load watermark they are 7-8ths, and above that they are one inch in thickness. The hull consists of seven water-tight compartments. The cargo of the vessel is to be stowed in two of these divisions, 75 feet each in length, 20 in breadth, and 20 in height. These tanks are built in the centre line of the ship and are capable of receiving 500 tons measurement of cargo. They are completely water-tight, and in the event of an accident to the hull would of themselves be sufficient to keep the ship afloat. The vessel, in fact, has a double bottom under the tanks for the stowage of the goods so that if the outer shell were beaten in or strained, the inner would preserve the cargo intact. The coal bunkers are placed on each outer side of these tanks, and are made to contain 1,800 tons of coal. The engines, which are of 883-horse power, are on the side-lever principle, with two cylinders of 100 inches diameter each and 12 feet stroke of piston. The apparatus for starting the engines is also constructed so that the operation will be comparatively easy. The paddles measure 40 feet 8 inches in diameter over the rings. The accommodation for passengers is in harmony with the splendid general capacity of the ship. She has 157 cabins, affording sleeping accommodation to 300 passengers. These cabins are each 9 feet in height, which, with the excellent system of ventilation introduced, will render them airy and healthy. Surmounting the main deck there is a deck-house, the roof of which forms a promenade from stem to stern. The saloons will afford dining accommodation for above 300 persons. When the Scotia was launched her weight was about 2,800 tons, but now that the heavy weight of her machinery is on board, she is about 4,000 tons, and draws 20 feet of water.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/25/archives/the-new-cunard-steamship-scotia.html,,"The Scotia, the latest and most magnificent of the line of Cunard Royal Mail steamers, is approaching completion on the Clyde.

They are completely water-tight, and in the event of an accident to the hull would of themselves be sufficient to keep the ship afloat. The vessel, in fact, has a double bottom under the tanks for the stowage of the goods so that if the outer shell were beaten in or strained, the inner would preserve the cargo intact. The coal bunkers are placed on each outer side of these tanks, and are made to contain 1,800 tons of coal. The engines, which are of 883-horse power, are on the side-lever principle, with two cylinders of 100 inches diameter each and 12 feet stroke of piston. The apparatus for starting the engines is also constructed so that the operation will be comparatively easy. The paddles measure 40 feet 8 inches in diameter over the rings. The accommodation for passengers is in harmony with the splendid general capacity of the ship. She has 157 cabins, affording sleeping accommodation to 300 passengers. These cabins are each 9 feet in height, which, with the excellent system of ventilation introduced, will render them airy and healthy. Surmounting the main deck there is a deck-house, the roof of which forms a promenade from stem to stern. The saloons will afford dining accommodation for above 300 persons. When the Scotia was launched her weight was about 2,800 tons, but now that the heavy weight of her machinery is on board, she is about 4,000 tons, and draws 20 feet of water.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Cunard Steamship Scotia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Cunard Steamship Scotia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b61df9fe-8da4-5598-9397-be718be4c7bb,632,nyt://article/b61df9fe-8da4-5598-9397-be718be4c7bb,

The Congress, it is added, will presently adjourn to reassemble there. This legislation is the slow fulfillment of an old promise. Last Spring, when the fate of the Border States was still uncertain, the location of the Confederate capital was a bribe, with which it was attempted to allure each in turn. Virginia, as the most essential to the project of capturing the National capital, wasfirst caught with the bait, and the capital was removed from Montgomery to Richmond. Tennessee was next wanted, and Kentucky and Missouri were sure to follow the lead ofTennessee; and no sooner was Virginia first deceived, and then fairly subjugated by the Confederate army, than the offer was made for the final location of the Capital at Nashville. It is difficult to over-estimate the efficacy of this dazzling temptation in procuring the almost unanimous vote of Middle Tennessee for secession. Tennessee was bought; but Missouri hesitated, and what was worse, Kentucky absolutely refused to follow. This failure of a plot otherwise excellent, rendered it both unsafe and impolitic to remove to Nashville. That city was too near a hostile frontier. By railroad and river it was easily accessible to attacks from the swarming loyalists of the Northwestern States; and, indeed, so long as the main military strength of the rebellion was grouped before Washington, it would have been in the last degree reckless to have confided the rebel executive and legislature to the protection of BUCKNER's ill-organized, unprovided, and sickly mob of misnamed soldiery.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Removal of the Rebel Congress from Richmond to Nashville.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Removal of the Rebel Congress from Richmond to Nashville.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23d98253-9328-5ccb-9a7c-e7b5ae042a0e,917,nyt://article/23d98253-9328-5ccb-9a7c-e7b5ae042a0e,

"JEFF. DAVIS, his Government and his Congress are exceedingly peripatetic. The so-called Southern Confederacy has only been in existence about threequarters of a year, and each quarter it establishes a new Confederate Capital.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/26/archives/the-new-rebel-capital.html,,"JEFF. DAVIS, his Government and his Congress are exceedingly peripatetic. The so-called Southern Confederacy has only been in existence about threequarters of a year, and each quarter it establishes a new Confederate Capital. The first head-quarters of the concern were at Montgomery, Ala. That somewhat muddy town JEFF. DAVIS reached on the 16th of last February, he having previously been elected to the bogus Presidency by the Convention held at that place. After getting the machine in running order at Montgomery, the Southern Congress resolved that the whole machinery of Government should proceed as far as Richmond, Va., on its way to Washington City, which was then supposed to be within rebel grasp. Accordingly, in May, the Confederate Departments began to pack up their traps for a march of some seven hundred miles, in a northeasterly direction; and DAVIS himself reached Richmond on the 29th of that month. On the 20th of June, the Confederate Congress renewed in Virginia the session which it had begun in Alabama -- the National army not having made a ""forward"" movement for its dispersion. Finding Washington to be a very sour and unattainable grape, it now resolved upon a return march westward, some six hundred miles -- this time, however, moving in the direction of west by north. It is doubtless intended to make Nashville the permanent Capital of the dissolving Confederacy; but another body of men than the bogus Congress may have something to say about that ere long -- a very large body, too, armed with what THOMAS CARLYLE calls ""big, long knives."" Nashville is much nearer the geographical centre of this Confederacy than either of the previous Capitals -- that is, if the Confederacy includes, as probably it does by this time, Kentucky and Missouri. The Rump Breckinridge Kentucky Convention assembled at Russellville, on the southern verge of that State, and the Rump Claib. Jackson Missouri Legislature, in session at Neosho, on the southern border of that State, have probably both by this time passed secession ordinances, and declared their respective Territories part and parcel of the Southern despotism. This capital movement will be a new inducement to them to bind their fortunes irrevocably with the rebel Government. The people of the Mississippi Valley have all long looked forward to the establishment of the National Capital in their midst; and the Confederate conspirators doubtless think they have made a shrewd movement this time. It points also to the final determination of the mooted question of secession boundaries -- running the secession line up to the Ohio River, down that river to its junction with the Mississippi, thence up to the northern boundary of the State of Missouri, and thence westward as far as -- they can get.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW REBEL CAPITAL', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW REBEL CAPITAL', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6815fc63-1d1b-50bb-8f92-59a9b95a8934,1499,nyt://article/6815fc63-1d1b-50bb-8f92-59a9b95a8934,

Indeed, at the very start of the municipal canvass, Tammany had grace to confess its inability to contend with Mr. WOOD, unless reinforced by the Republicans.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/27/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"The spell which has rested upon military and naval operations at Fort Pickens, was rudely broken by Col. BROWN and Commodore McKEAN, on Saturday last. On that day, according to reports which reach us through rebel sources, fire was opened by the fort upon the rebel batteries at Barrancas and the Navy-yard, while the Niagara and the Colorado engaged Fort McRae. The reports of the engagement -- which was still proceeding on Sunday night -- are extremely meagre, and bear a striking similarity to those which preceded the authentic accounts of the affair at Port Royal. According to these reports, which are contained in a copy of the Norfolk Day Book received at Fortress Monroe, the Navy-yard had been set on fire three times by hot shot thrown by Col. BROWN'S guns, and Warrington had been entirely destroyed. As an offset to these disasters, the rebels insist that in their engagement with Fort McRae, the Niagara and Colorado were so badly damaged that they were forced to haul off for repairs, and that a breach had already been made in the walls of Fort Pickens. This latter assertion, however, will be regarded as ridiculous, when it is remembered that Fort Sumter was not breached by the terrible rain of shot which was poured upon it at a much shorter range. It is worthy of note that a considerable loss of life is acknowledged by the rebels; and it is safe to conclude that they have been very badly punished. The immediate cause of the hostilities is not yet explained, but it will perhaps be found in the fact that the rebels were making active preparations for an attack upon the Fort, which were simply forestalled. The reports by the George Peabody, which left the Fort on the 18th, led us to expect immediate hostilities.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/695d2b82-1bc7-573d-96dd-5092c140b896,1296,nyt://article/695d2b82-1bc7-573d-96dd-5092c140b896,

Towards morning, MULVAHILL stealthily left his sleeping friend, and proceeded to the adjoining room, occupied by Mrs. MCKIERNAN. She was awakened by the noise, and immediately screamed for help. Her husband ran to her assistance, but before he had time to aid her, Lieut. MULVAHILL, finding himself in an unpleasant situation, instantly drew a bowie-knife, and plunged it into the abdomen of Mr. MCKIERNAN, inflicting injuries so serious that the physician in attendance pronounced them fatal. The offender immediately fled, but the police having been notified of the affair, tracked him through different parts of the City, and succeeded in arresting him about 10 A.M. He was taken to the Twenty-first Precinct Station-house, and detained to await the result of MCKIERNAN's injuries.

THOMPSON, at the Broadway Tabernacle, preached a sermon upon the present war, and the advantages to us as a nation. He gave a brief history of the origin of the observance of a day of thanksgiving in this country, and considered that the present occasion was one calling for special thanks on our part. His discourse would relate to the present condition of the country. What was the cause of our present disturbed condition? It was Southern Slavery. The spirit of Slavery was essentially tyrannical and despotic, and had created at the South an aristocracy inimical to republican institutions. While republicanism was based upon just representation, the oligarchy of the South had for its foundation a species of human chattelism. The effect of this aristocratic and oligarchtic spirit had been largely dominant in the political affairs of this nation for the last thirty years. Every measure -- whether of the mails, the division of territory, or the regulation of the internal policy of the Government -- had been taken in the interest of Slavery. We, as a nation, had begun to lose sight of those patriotic sentiments which animated for fathers in the formation of the Government. Our constant and habitual deference to the spirit of Slavery was fast extinguishing our National feeling, and there was danger of our statesmen becoming mere sycophants. Even the pulpit, in its subserviency to the slaveocracy, had gone so far as to compare American Slavery to the patriarchal and Mosaic institution, and to argue that it was a benediction of mercy to the African race. Something was needed to awaken us from this lethargy, and the first gun which boomed against our flag aroused us like the trump of the resurrection. We stood upon our feet once more; the dry bones rose up and presented an array which indicated that that trumpet-call was indeed a resurrection to new life. We should thank God for this rekindling of the smouldering fires of patriotism which had so long slumbered. Another cause for thankfulness was the abundance and prosperity which had marked our progress thus far in this struggle for National existence. The history of wars showed that distress, suffering, and even famine, were the necessary accompaniments. But who among us was really suffering for the necessaries of life? We had ourselves raised every dollar needed for the prosecution of the war, and the bountifulness of our crops, and the fruitfulness of our commerce, had maintained us in a position of prosperity compared with that of any nation ever before engaged in war. Another, and the highest cause of thankfulness, was the success which had thus far attended our efforts in maintaining Constitutional Government. Though our arms had met with some reverses, yet, on the whole were in a conquering position. The spirit which had been aroused in the nation was ominous of success. It had come to be considered, once again, glorious to die for a good cause. A LYON and a BAKER were shining examples of devotion to their country. Intelligent foreigners had predicted the overthrow of the Government, through lack of loyalty in the people. But we were beginning to return again to the spirit which animated the patriot fathers. Whatever names in the conduct of this war might hereafter fill the official roll, the prudence and wisdom of WINFIELD SCOTT, and the promptitude mid bravery of the men of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, would never be forgotten. [Applause.] Not only must this rebellion be put down, but Slavery incarnated in it must be extirpated. Let it be known that righteous men, praying men were working and praying without ceasing for this end and that they would never rest satisfied until the dragon of rebellion was cast into the bottomless pit, and the cover shut down, never again to be raised. [Applause.] This was no time to put on sackcloth, but rather garments of praise and gladness. God was establishing his government upon the earth; he was giving the land to the saints, if they only knew enough to take it. We should take courage and go on from conquering to conquer, until the whole earth shall be under the divine government, and the land be filled with the glory of God.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SERMON BY REV.

Long will the happy disappointment be remembered of Pelion on Ossa piled in the way of poultry, vegetables, and all sorts of good things, sufficient to satisfy the nine hundred youthful partakers and their invited guests. In the dining-room where this feast was laid no less than three hundred thousand meals have been furnished this year, to the beneficiaries of this useful institution. Crossing the space in front of the building we come to a corresponding institution conducted by the ladies of the Methodist Church. Here we find five hundred children in joyous anticipation of a hearty dinner, and a useful present afterwards. Every child has, through the kindness of those faithful friends of the Mission, Mrs. DEUEL and Mrs. SKIDMORE, received an entire new suit of clothes, including a pair of good substantial shoes for the girls and boots for the boys. The Chapel was adorned with large flags and intermediate mottoes in moss upon the walls, such as ""He that giveth to the poor shall not lack."" In the schoolroom were laid tables to accommodate from twelve to thirteen hundred persons, and the provisions, looming in every direction, was a curiosity, not only in quantity but in quality. For instance, one huge loaf of bread from Mr. CROOKS weighed two hundred and fifty pounds. The butchers of Washington and West Washington Markets vied with the vegetable and poultry dealers in that bountiful locality in representing themselves. Sheep, whole and in halves, to the amount of a dozen, were dumped into the receptacle at the Mission. A porker, of no slender proportions, from CORSEN & SHIELDS, was stuffed and roasted and served up in a state of entirety, ""occupying a position"" upon the huge salver, so natural as to repel the invading knife of a humane carver. His porkship was flanked by another happy effort of New-York bakers, in the form of a roll, weighing one hundred pounds, being a gift from Mr. HOYLER. Messrs. CROOKS & HUSEY have this year, as usual, gratuitously cooked all the raw material sent to the Mission.

Amidst the convulsions and calamities of secession, disunion, treason, and the vast crimes accompanying and following rebellion on such a scale, although these things are beyond question the judgments of God against us for the sin of Slavery which has brought these very evils upon us, yet, viewed in another light, the war itself, though the worst of all wars, civil and fratricidal, is the greatest of God's mercies for our Government, country and people, if we will so receive it. For the first time in our history, it places our great national iniquity at our disposal, with power to sweep it from the country at a blow, and is rapidly uniting all parties and classes in this opinion, and in the determination so to deal with it. The opportunity is granted by God, and it is an opportunity, in fact, of national regeneration, of reintegration; not merely reunion or reconstruction as heretofore, but transfiguration. The old sole cause of disunion, crime and evil is cast out, and the law of sin and of death conquered and replaced by the law of freedom and life -- the law of the spirit of life as it is in Christ Jesus. It is an opportunity in which God offers us back again our original power over our own Government, which was fast passing from our hands, and the Government itself becoming an oligarchical despotism. It is an opportunity in which God calls upon us as a people to obey him and act as sovereigns under his rule, reserving, as our right, the right over the administration of our own Government.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SERMON OF THE REV.

Formal possession was then taken of the island. It is also announced that another expedition, under command of Gen. VIELE, consisting of two brigades, was being fitted out at Port Royal, and was expected to sail in a few days for some point further South. All the light draught gunboats were to accompany this new expedition. The condition of affairs at Beaufort appears to be unchanged. Two gunboats remained anchored off the town, which was still unoccupied by either National or rebel troops. Large quantities of cotton yet remained untouched, in store-houses and barns, and the slaves continued to come in daily in large numbers. Our troops have completed intrenchments entirely across Hilton Head Island. There was considerable sickness among them -- a prevailing form of disease being sore throat.

How it may seem to some incongruous that a day of Thanksgiving should be kept, while such trials are convulsing this nation. How sad to the heart, cherishing the love of man, is the thought of all the rancorous enmities that are now festering in the bosom of the nation; how awful the spectacle of a great Republic torn by fratricidal strife, how exasperating those voices wafted from over the seas, rejoicing in our calamity and asserting the combined success of our Republic hence forth to be an impossibility, and yet the faith of the believer is justified by the renewed exhibition of God's Providence in refusing to draw the hasty, rash, inconsiderate inferences which so many suggest. We may not only talk the trials in patience, but rejoice over them, and out of the very heart of such trials, it is but just that we should give thanks to Almighty God: we have reason as a people to give thanks. We have reason for thanks as we remember all His bounties to our forefathers, as we see all that He did for the planters who first settled in our land and what He accomplished for us in those early tunes of trouble, making us grow most rapidly in wealth, spreading our arts how swiftly and how widely over the face of the globe. Yet, supposing disaster, and ignominy, and gloom, should now be drawn over all the past, there would still be cause for thanksgiving for the successes and glories of that past. But we have reason to believe these times of peril betoken only a future still more glorious than the past, for whom he loveth he chasteneth. So he dealt with his own beloved Apostles, and especially with Paul, the chief Apostle of our faith. We have reason to bless God for these times of trial, because of the great national evils they have to some extent rebuked and checked. Our political parties were fast becoming scheming organizations, in which all the craft and venality which have marked the darkest stages of nations in the Old World, were becoming rooted, and poisoning our national life. We were, in our worldly prosperity, becoming a mere material brute. What the Bible calls ""filthy lucre"" was becoming more and more, under the name of the ""Almighty Dollar,"" the Holy One of this nation; and material advancement was supposed to be the duty of every one who wished case, and influence, and happiness. If anything has occurred to check this awful tide -- if God, no matter how sharply, has thrown his own broad dyke across this gushing flood -- is there not reason for earnest, solemn, united thanksgiving.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SERMON BY REV.

"Morning services were held at this Church yesterday, Rev. A.H. VINTON, the Rector of the Church, officiating. His text was the second verse of the 103d Psalm: ""Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits.""  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/29/archives/sermon-by-rev-dr-ah-vinton-st-marks-church.html,,"Morning services were held at this Church yesterday, Rev. A.H. VINTON, the Rector of the Church, officiating. His text was the second verse of the 103d Psalm: ""Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits."" He considered the duty of thanksgiving was earlier than the duty of prayer, because God anticipates our desires and supplies our wants before we have the sense of need or intelligence to ask relief. It was, moreover, not only the earliest, but a perpetual duty, for as the bounty is constant gratitude should be not less habitual. He dwelt to considerable length on the innumerable blessings and benefits we were constantly receiving from the hand of God, and our unmindfulness of them, and thought there was a special fitness in setting apart occasions for thanksgiving as we needed the majesty of a solemn period to stir us to the most spiritual of holy duties, praise. Placed as we are in a community where, notwithstanding crying iniquities, there is an almost redeeming power of morality, under the protection of law, whose very force resides in the general reverence for law, wrought into the substance of the American mind, with a fabric, of Government reared on the justest theory of human rights, a theory hitherto proved to be just by the most successful experience, never shaken, although assaulted from without, and only until recently settled the deeper on its foundations from the commotions within. We have stood politically and socially on an eminence of advantage, where it is entirely safe to say no people has ever before reached. The foundations of [???] other Governments have been laid on two facts, the force of the ruler, and the ignorance of the ruled. The theory of those Governments takes for granted the inferiority of their subjects, it presumes them to be incapable of wise political action, and by its very tendency, perpetuates that inferiority. When the founders of our Republic broke the bonds of historic precedent, and established a system of equal laws and popular rights, they chose a course, whose successful issue would be the most exalted state of human advancement and blessing. If some wise political seer with the programme of our Government before him had undertaken to forecast its history, his reflections would undoubtedly have taken this form. It is an experiment. If it shall ultimately succeed it will be the glory and crown of humanity. If it fail, man will fall to a greater depth than ever, because it will be the depth of disappointment and, of course, despair. Beyond all doubt man can be fully developed only as he is free. Whether his development be for good or ill depends on the direction his freedom takes. On this point lingers his social destiny, and here resides the solemn peril of self-government. The reverend Doctor considered, at some length, the innumerable blessings that would naturally flow from such a government. But suppose, be safe, the prophetic glance had pierced the crisis that threatens the nation to-day, would be then exult and praise? Would he thank God for the clamor, fury, blood and death, of fraternal hate and sectional battle of passion, that had seized one-third of the nation, and acting like a madness blindest to its nearest interests. He thought so, for reasons both general and special. No nation had ever reached the citadel of security and empire without marching through the field of its own slain, and swimming a ditch filled with its own blood; that the majority of wars that make up the history of nations have been civil wars, whose fury was the pledge of surer and safer peace. In our long and intense prosperity we had felt so little the restraints of law on individual action, that we had almost forgotten there was a Government at all, and from that luxurious dream we needed to be aroused. ""Have we a Government?"" was the thundering appeal that echoed from the siege of Sumter, and thrilled every loyal heart like the voice of God, with an enthusiasm purely divine. That great truth has at last been vindicated, and if we cannot bless God for this, what earthly boon can stir our benumbed souls to grateful recognition. He thought it a sin to despair of the Republic. He did not doubt that the war would be a long one, which must cause a change in the social institutions of the South which no quick victory could accomplish. If, said he, it should happen that by the reduced value of the slave a change should be induced in his condition and position; if the system of Slavery should be readjusted, and free labor substituted for forced and servile, to the equal advantage of master and man, then, Ethiopia stretch out her unmanacled hands to God, and the loud hallelujah should burst forth from all the oppressed made free.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""SERMON BY REV.

Our religion teaches us that under no circumstances is the mind permitted to despair. Our religion commands us that it is our duty to return thanks for the chastisements which the justice of God inflicts upon us, as sincerely and as devoutly as we do for those blessings which His mercy bestows upon us, even as the prophet Isaiah tells us in the first verse of the twelfth chapter, ""Thus shalt thou say on that day: I will thank Thee, O Lord, though Thou wert angry with me, for when Thy anger departed, Thou consoledst me. Behold God is my strength; in Him I will trust, for my strength and my harmony is the Lord; He also is my salvation."" These words are to guide our reflections on this day of mixed emotions.

A flag of truce came down from Norfolk to Fortress Monroe on Thursday, but brought no news--the rebels refusing to give any information whatever. We find in the Philadelphia Inquirer, however, a dispatch from Fortress Monroe, dated the 27th, purporting to give additional particulars of the fight, but which appears to be merely an exaggeration of the rebel reports already published. According to this dispatch, based on the statement of persons from Norfolk, no breach had been made in the walls of Fort Pickens, though one was expected to be made on Monday, when BRAGG, with reinforcements which he expected, was to storm the fort. The storm of hot shot and shell concentrated upon the Navy-yard from the fort had at last fired the place so effectually that the rebels found it impossible to extinguish the flames, and the buildings had been entirely destroyed, together with a large amount of army and ordnance stores. Pensacola had been evacuated by order of BRAGG. There certainly could have been no necessity for this, unless the rebels were suffering a disastrous defeat, as the place is eight miles from the scene of operations. Another bad indication for the rebels is the declaration said to have been made to his men by BRAGG, that he would never surrender alive. The ill-success of the National vessels against the rebel batteries is again mentioned, the number engaged being five -- the names of the Niagara and the Colorado only being given. The former is stated to have been almost riddled with rockets, while the Colorado was thoroughly disabled.

They were landed at the foot of Fourteenth-street, North River, in the early part of the day, and made a very creditable appearance on their march down Broadway, the men being, at that time, apparently sober. A large crowd witnessed the passage of the troops till they arrived at the foot of Battery-place, where the boat was lying ready to take them on board. But at this point a different scene began to be enacted. The first three companies passed through the gate on to the pier at which the steamer was lying, in good military style. Several women desiring to follow them, were repulsed by the guard in attendance at the gate. This created considerable excitement among the soldiers, and in order to keep out all who did not belong to the regiment, as well as to restore order in the ranks, a halt was ordered, and the gates closed. Several of the soldiers thereupon broke rank, and the example being immediately followed by others, in a very short time a large number of the regiment started for the saloons and drinking shops in Battery-place, West and State streets. They were, of course, accompadied by their relatives and friends, who had followed them for the purpose of witnessing the embarkation. Soon a scene of the greatest confusion and disorder prevailed. Soldiers, who a short time before were orderly and obedient, were now either raving with passion, or so stupidly intoxicated as to be unable to walk. The ranks were broken, and the scene at this time is represented, by those who witnessed it, to have been of the most disgraceful character. Finally the gates of the pier were opened, and the order given for all belonging to the regiment to march in. The soldiers, accompanied by their friends, rushed forward; but the latter being driven back with force by the guard at the gates, all again became a scene of confusion, and a disgraceful riot spread through the whole, extending itself as the numbers increased, and the passions of the men became more inflamed. Those who were outside declared they would not go unless their friends could be admitted inside the gates, and those already in, were anxious to get out on a short furlough. But the officers had determined that neither party should be gratified. Bayonets, knives, and other weapons were then freely used, and it is reported that several were seriously wounded. The officers, for a time, had no command over their men, and when the soldiers inside found there was no way of escaping by the gates, many of them rushed forward towards the northern side of the dock, in spite of the great exertions of their officers to prevent it, -- and some of them succeeded in escaping by the way of a schooner which was anchored in the vicinity. Others climbed up the side of the gates, in doing which, two fell into the water, and one man is believed to have been drowned, as he was heard making cries as if strangling, and is not known to have been rescued.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Riot Among the Soldiers of the Third Regiment Irish Brigade.; THE SIXTY-THIRD (IRISH) REGIMENT HAVE A BATTLE AMONG THEMSELVES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Riot Among the Soldiers of the Third Regiment Irish Brigade.; THE SIXTY-THIRD (IRISH) REGIMENT HAVE A BATTLE AMONG THEMSELVES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-11-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/34d366bb-7334-52a8-9aaf-db4bced07b3b,794,nyt://article/34d366bb-7334-52a8-9aaf-db4bced07b3b,
