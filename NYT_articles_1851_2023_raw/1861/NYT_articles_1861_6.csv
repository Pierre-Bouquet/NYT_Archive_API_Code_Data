War, like every work of destruction, is a very simple matter. A fool or a madman can apply the torch to an edifice, which only one in a million can rear. It is easy to destroy life, while the most skillful are baffled in their efforts to preserve it, no matter how slight the apparent cause or distemper which threatens it. If we capture prisoners, the books are full of precedents for their disposition. But what shall we do with the slaves that may fall into our hands by the fortunes of the war, who to the South are chattels -- to the North human beings? Gen. BUTLER'S decision, approved by the Government, only serves to place them on our hands. We may find useful employment for ten or twenty thousand, but what shall we do with fifty or a hundred thousand? They must be presently fed and clothed, and though clearly contraband in reference to the rebels, we cannot treat them as other articles contraband of war, put them up at auction, and sell them to the highest bidder. In numerous instances it will be found that they can never be returned to Slavery. Their former masters may have abandoned them in their flight. When in arms against the United States, they can no more expect that their negroes, than horses, which may happen to fall into our hands, shall be returned to them.

By the light of the moon, as the neighbors entered the yard, they espied a dead body, and on going further found the bodies of Mr. MACE and his wife, both mangled and bloody to a terrible extent. A pale light was first discovered, which in a few moments revealed the fact that the house had been fired from the inside, and the flames shortly bursting out, the yard door was discovered stained with blood, and the bodies of the three murdered victims presented a revolting spectacle.

In consequence of the request of the jurors to be enlightened as to their power in the matter of investigating the alleged frauds committed by contractors for supplying the army with clothing, &c., Judge CADWALLADER gave them the following instructions: An act of Congress makes it criminal for any person having the charge or custody of arms, ordnance, muntiions, shot, powder or nabiliments of war belonging to the United States, or of any provisions for the victualing of any soldiers, gunners, marines and pioneers, to embezzle, purloin or convey away any of the same for lucre or gain, or for the purpose of hindering or impeding the service of the United States, or, knowing of, and being privy to, such offence, to counsel, aid or abet it. Another act of Congress makes it criminal to falsely make, alter, forge or counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsely made, altered, forged our counterfeited, or willingly aid or assist in falsely making, altering, forging or counterfeiting any writing for the purpose of obtaining or receiving, or enabling any other person or persons, either directly or indirectly, to obtain or receive from the United States, or any of their officers or agents, any sum or sums of money, or to alter or publish as true, or cause to be altered or published as true, any such false, forged, altered or counterfeited writing with intent to defraud the United States, knowing the same to be false, altered, forged or counterfeited, or to transmit to, or present at, or cause or procure to be transmitted to or presented at any office, or officer, of the Government of the United States, any writing in support of, or in relation to, any account or claim, knowing the same to be false, altered, forged or counterfeited. As this enactment has been judicially interpreted, a criminal offence is committed under it by a person who, knowing a genuine writing to contain a false statement, uses it for any such fraudulent purpose.

We shall have forthwith a comparison of the military skill which the veteran SCOTT and the unpracticed. DAVIS bring to the field; with a result all themore conclusive, because the best military leader of the South is at the head of the insurgents, and if he be beaten, we have overcome the best material they can throw into the conflict.

The testimony of the persons who witnessed the occurrence fully corroborated the report published in yesterday's TIMES. Both men had permitted themselves to become excited while discussing the troubles of the country, and deceased earnestly proclaimed himself a sympathizer with the rebels. MERRITT, the prisoner, insisted that his opponent should repeat after him the words ""United States or nothing,"" and shot him for refusing. The inquest was held at the Eighth Precinct Station-house, which was filled with friends of the deceased and the prisoner, to whom the proceedings seemed deeply interesting. MERRITT fled after he had done the mischief, but in the course of a couple of hours surrendered himself to the police, asserting his innocence of having fired the fatal shot. This assertion he has since persisted in making; but the testimony left the jury no cause for doubting his guilt, and a verdict was rendered against him.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/02/archives/the-regeneration-of-virginia.html,,"There is no civilizer like war, because nothing so thoroughly tries the strength and exposes the weakness of a people. The consciousness of the latter is always the first step to reform. The tendency of a nation, like that of an individual, is to indulge its predominant trait or characteristics till these become a monstrous deformity or vice, overshadowing every generous and noble quality, and proving fatal in the end unless corrected by an outward pressure, or emergency, sufficient to change the whole current of a nation's habits and ideas. Such an emergency may, and often does, involve the destruction of a whole generation. But its loss is amply compensated in the advantage of those that follow. Had the Emperor NICHOLAS lived a thousand years, he could never have been diverted from the grand purpose of his life, the possession of Constantinople, and the realization of the traditions of his ancestors. The Crimean war, the first of these traditions, dispelled for a time the dream of territorial aggrandisement, disclosed the weak spot in the Empire, exhausted its means, and turned the attention of the new Emperor to the subject of internal reform, instead of foreign conquest. The enfranchisement of the serfs was the result. In its results, the advantage of the war to Russia was incalculable, and compensated fifty times for the losses and sacrifices she sustained in her great defeat. It was the beneficent event in her history. Defeat was the only instructor that could reach her rugged nature, and turn it to deeds of humanity, to the development of her real strength.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Regeneration of Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Regeneration of Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6ba6e6c-7dfe-53db-bdbb-fc869f2b12b0,1084,nyt://article/e6ba6e6c-7dfe-53db-bdbb-fc869f2b12b0,

The affair with the rebel batteries at Aquia Creek, reported yestesday as in progress, appears to have been quite a brisk one.

Three batteries were opposed to them, throwing very heavy metal, and yet, strange as it may appear, no one on board the vessels was killed, and but one wounded. The loss of the rebels is not known with certainty, though it is thought that it must have been considerable, as one account states that men were seen carrying dead and wounded to places of safety. The Pawnee finally went to the assistance of the vessels engaged, and two of the batteries were effectually silenced -- the third being so far away as to render necessary a landing force.

The hall of the representatives of the people, in which the voice of no foreigner had been heard for over thirty years, now sounds under the measured steps of the Spanish sentinel, and its echoes repeat the clattering of his armor. To complete this work of debasement, SANTANA has declared, in an address to the people, that ties of consanguinity on one hand, the peace and prosperity of the Republic on the other, had compelled the majority to give up the constitution of the country, and to surrender to the Spanish Queen. But the hypocrisy of such a language has deceived no one. At the very moment the address of SANTANA was published, JOSE-MARIA CABRAL, the Commander of the Dominican army, the General who defeated SOULOUQUE in 1855, was issuing an appeal to the nation, in which he said: SANTANA has sold the Republic -- to-morrow we we shall be slaves, -- let us rise to the voice of freedom, etc. * * * Unfortunately his voice was stifled in the outcry of the Spanish troops, and by the shouts of the Spanish emigrants, brought from the island of Cuba and Porto Rico, by the care of SANTANA, who has been rewarded with the great cross of ISABELLA, for his services in this affair.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Will Spain be able to retain Dominica?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Will Spain be able to retain Dominica?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'SANTO DOMINGO', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/381ec2fa-6e5c-593a-9c6b-500581502f74,1018,nyt://article/381ec2fa-6e5c-593a-9c6b-500581502f74,

About 6 1/2 o'clock the sound of the pibroch was heard, and soon after the kilted pipers were seen treading their way through the multitude, preceded by an admirably-drilled squad of our Metropolitan Police. Then came the officers, variously clad in the tartans of their clans; then the Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Col. ELLIOTT, and various other military dignitaries; then the men, dressed in dark jackets tipped with red, and plaid pantaloons; and then the overwhelming applause of gratified thousands. The regiment numbers about 880 men, the majority of whom are extremely imposing in appearance. Scotias' fame in war, in arts, and in letters, is worldwide. Looking on these, her sons, as they went forth pesterday, it was not difficult to believe that her fame in the first of these ""fine arts"" will be maintained and renewed on American soil. If an occasion should arise for the display of valor; for the exercise of tough endurance, or the exhibition of content amid scenes of hardship and trial, we may rest assured that the Highland Guard will improve it and give an example to others. The men of whom it is composed are among the thriftiest and most industrious of our community. There is scarcely one who has not sacrificed a certainty of existence to go with this regiment and place his life at the disposal of the Government. It was the pibroch of the MCGREGOR's that saved the heroic defenders of Lucknow, and we may depend on it that in the moment of danger, the pipes of the Seventy-ninth will bring comfort to many a beleagured spirit. The men are remarkably athletic; many of them have seen service in the Crimean and Indian wars, and all of them are of that tough texture which prevails in North Britain, and seems to be best calculated to resist exposure and privation. The regiment was announced to leage for Washington on almost every day of the past week. It has been impossible to procure a decent bowl of Scotch broth since Monday last, so great has been the extremity of all the lassies. Deficiencies in the equipments have led to the delay. It was determined, and wisely, that the regiment should not leave until it had obtained all the arms and equipments that it required. Hence, while the men were ready to move at a moment's notice, and the officers were burning with impatience, the hour of departure had to be postponed from day to day. These little disappointments were all forgotten yesterday, and the Seventy-ninth marched through a gathering scarcely inferior to that which assembled to bid farewell to the Seventh, on the 19th of April last. In the matter of enthusiasm there was no difference at all. The streets were crowded, and every one cheered. No occasion can produce a more genial and kindly result.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL MILITARY MOVEMENTS.; DEPARTURE OF THE SEVENTY-NINTH REGIMENT. COL. HAWKINS' ZOUAVES.

These three regiments are to be immediately followed by others -- enough, of course, to insure the permanent occupation of the place, which is of considerable strategic importance. The occupation of this town by our troops was preceded by another brilliant episode of the war, which probably had something to do with the precipitancy with which the rebel troops had left, and in which Company B, of the Second Cavalry, were again the principal actors. It will be recollected that on the occasion of their first dash into the town, on Saturday morning, they lost two of their men, who were taken prisoners by the rebels. It being understood that the rebels had threatened to hang these men yesterday morning, their comrades determined to attempt their rescue, and accordingly the company again proceeded to the town, and ascertaining by some means where the men were confined, they charged through the streets, rescued them, and brought them back to camp in triumph.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c2f00c49-f99a-54f0-8fdb-0e6cf5d113f5,1515,nyt://article/c2f00c49-f99a-54f0-8fdb-0e6cf5d113f5,

The operator was ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/04/archives/discovery-of-extensive-forgeries.html,,"-- A series of bold and extensive forgeries have just been brought to light in Washington, Penn. The operator was a man named J.W. SMITH, a resident of Cross Creek township, and widely known in the neighborhood. It appears that for the last few years he has been operating in the live stock and produce business, and in that capacity has sought and obtained frequent accommodations for considerable sums of money, several of his immediate neighbors becoming indorsers. In this way things have been going on for some time past, the artful operator all the while managing, by the prompt payment of some of his notes and the renewal of others, to keep up his credit and secure the entire confidence of those with whom he was dealing. Failing to meet a note which matured in one of the Wheeling banks last week, however, notice of protest was sent to the persons whose names appeared as indorsers, when it was found for the first time that their names had been forged to the paper! This of course led other parties who held his notes to make inquiry, and soon brought to light the astounding fact that all the indorsements upon which he had drawn funds were daring forgeries. It turns out that his indebtedness upon this sort of fraudulent paper to different parties about town amounts to about $24,000, made up thus: Notes disposed of to Dr. F.J. LEMOYNE, of Washington, $14,000; to WM. SMITH & SON, $3,000; to Franklin Bank of Washington, $1,000; to Wheeling Banks, $5,000; to Wellsburgh Bank, $2,000. Besides the foregoing, all of which are forgeries, SMITH leaves other liabilities behind him amounting to some $8,000 or $10,000. The scoundrel has, unfortunately for justice, made his escape to parts unknown, and there seems now but little probability that his capture will soon be effected. He has not been engaged in business for some time, and it is surprised that he took the greater part of his ill-gotten gain with him in his flight. -- Pittsburgh Chron., June 1.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISCOVERY OF EXTENSIVE FORGERIES', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DISCOVERY OF EXTENSIVE FORGERIES', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01bc7d28-2914-530e-a75b-8d7e3d2c750b,342,nyt://article/01bc7d28-2914-530e-a75b-8d7e3d2c750b,

Though engrossed by the great question of the temporality of the Pope, and by the important privileges granted by the Emperor to the legislative body in November last, they have, from time to time, published articles on American questions as remarkable for the correctness of their statements as for the elevation of their sentiments and their abhorrence of Slavery. Many of them, and most particularly the Journal des Debats, hailed the election of Mr. LINCOLN as a return to the pure and noble policy of WASHINGTON, and as an era of regeneration for the United States. Prepared as public opinion was beforehand, it is no wonder that the news of the Southern rebellion has found the French Government ill-disposed towards the disturbers of our public peace and prosperity.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The French Press and the Government.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The French Press and the Government.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6db3b72d-42bf-5022-ba87-84644a4c9695,502,nyt://article/6db3b72d-42bf-5022-ba87-84644a4c9695,

Penn. The operator was a man named J. W. SMITH, a resident of Cross Creek township, and widely known in the neighborhood. It appears that for the last few years he has been operating in the live stock and produce business, and in that capacity has sought and obtained frequent accommodations for considerable sums of money, several of his immediate neighbors becoming indorsers. In this way things have been going on for some time past, the artful operator all the while managing, by the prompt payment of some of his notes and the renewal of others, to keep up his credit and secure the entire confidence of those with whom he was dealing. Failing to meet a note which matured in one of the Wheeling banks last week, however, notice of protest was sent to the persons whose names appeared as indorsers, when it was found for the first time that their names had been forged to the paper! This of course led other parties who held his notes to make inquiry, and soon brought to light the astounding fact that all the indorsements upon which he had drawn funds were daring forgeries. It turns out that his indebtedness upon this sort of fraudulent paper to different parties about town amounts to about $24,000, made up thus: Notes disposed of to Dr. F.J. LEMOYNE, of Washington, $14,000; to WM. SMITH & SON, $3,000; to Franklin Bank of Washington, $1,000; to Wheeling Banks, $5,000; to Wellsburgh Bank, $2,000. Besides the foregoing, all of which are forgeries, SMITH leaves other liabilities behind him amounting to some $8,000 or $10,000. The scoundrel has, unfortunately for justice, made his escape to parts unknown, and there seems now but little probability that his capture will soon be effected. He has not been engaged in business for some time, and it is surmised that he took the greater part of his ill-gotten gain with him in his flight. -- Pittsburgh Chron., June 1.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISCOVERY OF EXTENSIVE FORGERIES', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DISCOVERY OF EXTENSIVE FORGERIES', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9889ce1a-e5d2-5cd7-91a5-c6f36b9f2ce3,342,nyt://article/9889ce1a-e5d2-5cd7-91a5-c6f36b9f2ce3,

There never was a greater fallacy, a more wicked perversion, than this. That the people of the Northern States hate the treason of the South, and would not hesitate to punish the unprincipled leaders who have fomented it into rebellion, is entirely true. This is inevitable, growing out of, and is the converse of their love for the Union against which that treason is in revolt; but there is not, and never has been, in the Northern minds, any such passion as hatred to the South. The history of the past proves this, and the instincts of every true heart attests it. The North has always been in the majority, and yet the honors and emoluments of official place have been enjoyed by the South to an extent greatly beyond their numerical proportion. From the Executive chair down to the lowest place in the Federal Government, the offices have, in a large majority, been held by Southern men. In the Army, the Navy, the Judiciary, the Secretaryships, the Foreign Missions, the Consulates, the clerkships in the Departments, the South has always had a majority. The course of the Government, the policy of the country, have been shaped to meet the pleasure and promote the interests of the South.

If the South seriously threatened to conquer the North, to put down trial by jury, freedom of the press, and representative government, the contest might be for liberty; but, as this is not so, the introduction of such topics is mere rhetorical amplification, ""Can you subdue the revolted States?"" ""Of course we can,"" says Mr. CLAY. So on that point there is no more to be said. ""Can you reconstruct the Union when one-half of it has conquered the other?"" ""Nothing easier,"" says Mr. CLAY. The victim of to-day will become the confederate of to-morrow: the traitors will be cast out, and the Union firmer than ever -- witness the happy results of the conquest of Ireland by England, repeated over and over again, and always repeated in vain.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REPLY OF THE TIMES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REPLY OF THE TIMES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ad9e610-6583-551b-9692-94f4a42b2ec7,681,nyt://article/9ad9e610-6583-551b-9692-94f4a42b2ec7,

"""The United States have accepted this civil war as an inevitable necessity."" Such is the declaration of Mr. SEWARD in his dispatch to the American Minister at Paris. The Secretary of the United States Government must have pondered well those words before he consigned them in a document to be laid before the first Power of Continental Europe. But they express a fact, one which has not received sufficient attention in England. It is often lightly asked here why the two sections of the American Union cannot separate, and live peaceably side by side. Those who thus speak have bestowed but a slight and superficial attention upon the nature of the causes of disagreement. The question may be met by another -- if nothing hinders them living peaceably side by side, why should they separate and sacrifice the Union, which is their common strength and glory? The statesmen of the North know full well that, however quietly they might acquiesce in the separation of the South, there could be no peace between Governments founded on principles so radically antagonistic as those embodied in the respective Constitutions of the Confederacy and of the United States. The promise, if seriously given would not and could not be kept. We have heard a good deal of the Monroe doctrine, and the determination of the citizens of the United States never to allow any European Government to transfer its institutions to a fresh portion of the American Continent; but the United States Government might with much less danger to its tranquillity allow this than permit the formation of a great Slave Power stretching from the Ohio to the Gulf. There is nothing in the forms of European Governments more inimical to the peace and freedom of the non-slaveholding States than the political doctrines openly proclaimed by the secession leaders. If the Confederacy could establish itself it would manifest itself to the world on the very morrow as a propagandist, aggressive, freebooting State, perpetually menacing its neighbors and embroiling them in hostilities. Its large idle population of poor and turbulent whites form the appropriate material of fillibustering forces, and would be ever annexing somebody. The extension of the area of Slavery, it should be remembered, was the very question on which the present rupture has taken place. Severed from the Union, the South would send out its bands in all directions, and carry Slavery far and wide. The acquisition of Mexico is one of the commonest promises made to their adherents by the Secession leaders. Is the [???] the American [???] Certainly it could not; it is therefore better to meet the mischief in its early stage. The only object the South have in separating is that Slavery hitherto limited by counteracting principles, may henceforth become sovereign, expanding itself, and pervading and moulding every institution of Government.

But a lower deep was to be reached, when President COBB, of the Montgomery Congress, proclaimed to the citizens of Atlanta that, as Virginia had ""at last shaken off the bonds of Lincoln,"" her soil was to be made the battle-ground; and added, as if apprehensive that the laggard sons of the Old Dominion would not come up to the mark, that Georgia, ""solitary and alone, if need be, would fight until she sees the last foul invader in his grave."" Still more pitiable was the exhibition at Richmond on the occasion of JEFFERSON DAVIS' triumphant entry. When on his visit to the new Fair Grounds, he was greeted on leaving his saddle by an ""enraptured"" crowd of ""soldiers and civilians"" whom we are told by the enthusiastic Enquirer this august magistrate ""indulged to a hand-shaking performance!""

The readiness with which they have adapted themselves to the present emergency, the intelligence they have displayed in the husbanding of our hitherto unknown military resources, the order they have preserved in the confusion of the hour, the ardor and enthusiasm manifested in every quarter, are significant symptoms of our qualities as a military people. All that remains for us to do is to add to our native genius that which knowledge alone can give. The art of war, which ancient and modern military nations always strove to make popular among the masses, in interesting the country in the operations of the army, and in availing themselves of the general informations resulting from such a system has, in the present circumstances, become as necessary to us as it was to them. Not that we deem necessary for our people to possess the science of a FREDERICK or a of NAPOLEON, but because had not this science been popular among the Prussians and the French at that time, neither FREDERICK nor NAPOLEON would have appeared. It is the military spirit of the people which makes great generals, and not great generals who make military nations. To create such spirit must then be the duty of those into whose hands the direction of public opinion has been intrusted. Enough has been done of late to show that a nation truly great cannot rest on justice, unless justice, like its Roman emblem, rests on a sword. Let us, then, arm public opinion with the offensive and defensive weapons with which the art of war has supplied us; that is to say, let us have summary and popular review of the manner in which armies are formed, organized and set in motion. In that way, everybody will be able to acquire some slight notions on military topics, and our taste gradually increasing with our knowledge, we will finally be as great in the art of war as we are in the art of peace.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOTES ON THE WAR.; Necessity of Creating a Military Spirit among our People-- Of the Military Art among the Ancients-- Of Modern Armies-- Of the Formation and Use of Infantry-- Of the Use of Cavalry-- Of the Use of Artillery--.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/06/archives/the-defence-of-the-canadas.html,,"We believe that Canada, equally with England, will stand neutral in the quarrel, and that the provinces of British America will be enabled to maintain their own without fear of aggression on the part of any assailant. But to be forearmed is true and sound policy. The battle field may extend from Washington to the south and west; but though Canada, from the loyalty of its people and its geographical position, may be exempted from all part in the contest, the policy which dictates military preparation, can neither be gainsaid nor controverted. We believe that, as a consequence of the Merrill Tariff, the stream of commerce and of emigration will be diverted from the United States to Canada. We have no apprehension that war's alarms will resound in the provinces. We find that whilst separation is an accomplished fact in the United States, British North America is clamorous for Federal Union. When we remember that Canada, Nova Scotia, and New-Brunswick possess a population equal to that of the thirteen colonies which eighty years ago revolted from this country, we cannot believe that they have no weight and authority in the future destinies of the American continent. Owing to the folly, the turbulence, and the violence of the South, the balance of power has been virtually transferred from republican America to monarchical Canada. At the request of Sir FENWICK WILLIAMS, the regular troops in the province are about to be augmented; but the true solution of the question of self-defence depends upon the volunteers, whom the home Government, with a view to the inquiries of the Military Colonial Expenditure Committee, now sitting, wish to patronize and extend. It is fortunate that the founder of the movement is Sir ALAN M'NAB, a gallant and honest soldier, who has equally, proved his loyalty to his mother country and his devotion to the best interests of North America. But it is the duty of Canada, on public and commercial grounds, to be prepared. It is stated that thousands of British subjects are flocking, with their goods and money, into Canada, being desirous of escaping from the horrors and calamities of civil war. The course of trace will be diverted from the belligerent Powers to the only State which by its in and waters can communicate directly with the North and the West. If the balance of power should fall to the lot of British North America, Canada, by her energy, activity and preparedness, is wiSely showing her appreciation both of her duties and rights at a great and important crisis, which a year ago no man living could have foreseen.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DEFENCE OF THE CANADAS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DEFENCE OF THE CANADAS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Post', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1e726f52-ab8d-5003-905b-cde4fef08ac7,436,nyt://article/1e726f52-ab8d-5003-905b-cde4fef08ac7,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/06/archives/the-campaign-in-virginia.html,,"Slowly, yet with energy, the Government is winding its tolls around the traitors of treason ridden Virginia. Every day sees the army, with its face set Southward, growing stronger, pushing forward here or there -- from Grafton and the Ohio River in the Northwest, from Fortress Monroe and the Chesapeake in the Southeast, and from Alexandria and other strategic points on the Potomac -- uniting always in its advance both caution and courage, and proclaiming as it goes friendship, freedom and the perpetual unity of the Republic. Eastern Virginia is, in a military point of view, already almost entirely surrounded by the Federal forces; and as JOHNSTON must soon evacuate Harper's Ferry, if he has not by this time been driven away, and Manassas Junction be speedily taken possession of by our troops, the revolting section will be practically cut off from the West, and hemmed in between river, mountain and sea; while it may be assaulted simultaneously and with overwhelming force by columns advancing from three of the cardinal points of the compass. The Eastern coast-line of the State, its boys and its rivers, are commanded by Federal man-of-war and their aids; Union troops hover along the whole Southern line of the Potomac, from the Shenandoah to Hampton Roads, daily moving their pickets southward; Richmond, which is both the military and political centre of Eastern Virginia, is immediately menaced; Gen. MCCLELLAN marches swiftly from the West, scattering the traitors as he goes, and will doubtless soon effect a junction with PATTERSON and the Pennsylvania troops -- if, indeed, that is the programme, -- while the forces at Alexandria, at Monroe, at and near Washington, and the immense reserves at Columbus, Chambersburgh, New-York, and at other points in the East and West, (an army greater than the whole white population of Eastern Virginia and all the Southern mercenaries now on her soil,) but await the signal from the great commander to precipitate themselves with resistless fury upon whatever opposes their southward march.

SCOTT's plan of the Virginia campaign, the country is assured that, with the resources at his command, there will be no backward step from its soil until the local and Confederate usurpers are driven beyond its borders.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Campaign in Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Campaign in Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2fe6fe2e-214b-5a2a-a1a6-02ab0e3c5a74,1113,nyt://article/2fe6fe2e-214b-5a2a-a1a6-02ab0e3c5a74,

CLAY has made a happy presentation of himself to the British public. He failed entirely to appreciate the traits of the people he assumed to address and instruct. His letter in the London Times is of a piece with those characteristics for which Mr. Bull feels unmitigated disgust. If he hates anything it is an enthusiastic admirer of institutions not his own, especially when the contrast is unfavorable to his national vanity. Mr. CLAY expatiates prodigally upon those of the United States. He eagerly rushed into the venerable presence, and, with palpitating heart and flushed cheek, delivered, in no very mincing manner, a piece of his mind. He argued pretty strongly and conclusively, and entreated England to extend her sympathy to those who, on this side of the water, are seeking to save from overthrow whatever is best in her institutions and ideas. All this, under other circumstances, might have been very well, but in London it was very ill. It proves that Mr. CLAY has seen very little of the world. John Bull does not want a lecture from Brother Jonathan. Nothing could be more badly timed, and nothing so well fitted to provoke hostility where the object was to secure friendly cooperation. John Bull has a very weak side, but Mr. CLAY failed entirely to hit it. He vaunted the very institutions for which the former feels a thorough disgust. Mr. CLAY glorified America. Mr. Bull tells us that everything is going wrong in America. What we feel most proud of is to him an offence. He knows we shall never get on till we mend our ways and copy after him. Mr. CLAY is like most Americans who, on their first visit to London, expect to find eager listeners to their glowing accounts of our own vast country, its resources, our progress in subduing and peopling it, and the excellence of institutions that can produce such results. Their hearts are running over with the subject, but their ardor is soon chilled when it comes in contact with English indifference and conceit. The last quality is the great foible of that nation. What to others would be a deformity, is to an Englishman an ornament. It is so English, is something to be proud of.

Misunderstanding, mismanagement and misfortune seem to have marked the brief career of this regiment. The failure of Lieut. BARTLETT to make good his promises of arms, uniforms pay, &c., caused disaffection among officers and men. The contractors who furnished the Sharp's rifles and uniforms, went to Portress Monroe with their goods, but very properly refused to deliver them without a legal requisition from the proper authority, on which they could draw their pay. Upon their arrival, Gen. BUTLER, out of a kind regard for the health and comfort of the men, ordered them landed, and temporary provision was made for them until he could hear from Washington, and a messenger was dispatched for the purpose, Mr. [???] ordered the whole force back to New-York. On promulgating the order, Gen. BUTLER kindly provided each man who chose to go back with the means of returning, and offered those who preferred to remain pay and rations to work upon the intrenchments.

There was no formal introduction or courtly display. Many of the citizens were acquainted with the distinguished man at the head of the Government and they introduced those who were not acquainted with him. The bearing of the President, and manner of reception, were dignified and simple, so that the humblest, as well as the highest, felt at ease. There was, evidently, a heartfelt respect for President DAVIS, and a sense of gratification on witnessing this, the first public ceremony indicating Richmond as the seat of Government. It was interesting to see such a large assemblage of all classes, the rich, beautiful, and fashionable mingling with those in the humblest walks of life, and was illustrative of our institutions.

HARDY, dry goods dealer, at No. 332 Bowery, discovered that his store had been broken into on Wednesday night and robbed of $2,000 worth of silks and laces. The Detective Police were notified, and officers FARLEY and EUSTACE examined the premises, finding that the side window and front door had been forced. From the manner in which the burglary had been effected, the Detectives felt confident that the delinquents were DAVID BARTLETT and JOHN WATSON, both noted rogues, and having visited the boarding house, No. 222 Thompson-street, where the burglars had been living since last December, the officers were fortunate enough to find them. At the time the Detectives entered the room, BARTLETT, WATSON, and a man named JOHN WILLIAMS, were engaged in overhauling, assorting and preparing for sale to a receiver of stolen goods the entire proceeds of the burglary, and the two were taken into custody, after a futile attempt on their part to escope by leaping from the window. The officers also found in the apartment a number of skeleton keys and other implements of rogue-craft, which doubtless had been used in the burglary. The prisoners were taken before Justice CONNOLLY, who committed them for examination. Their arrest was a source of intense surprise to the lady with whom they had been boarding, as their appearance and behavior during the few months they had lived with her was very gentlemanly. The officers deserve much commendation for the arrest of these rogues and the recovery of the property, all of which was effected within a few hours after they had been advised of the matter.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/04331fd7-1064-5bef-a247-5c0a63b1a5c4,368,nyt://article/04331fd7-1064-5bef-a247-5c0a63b1a5c4,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/07/archives/a-bankruptcy-law.html,,"Individual business capacity, energy and enterprise are as much a source of National wealth, as are rich agricultural districts, vast cotton fields, mines of the grosser metals, mountains of coal, gold placers or waterfalls, those natural motors for propelling machinery. The nation that is possessed of these, will flourish, while the people who lack them will run to decay, whatever the natural resources of their country may be. But business capacity, individual energy and enterprise may be overborne by those sudden changes and mutations to which the commercial world has always been more or less subject. These mutations are often such as no forecast can anticipate, and against, which human prudence cannot guard. They make their advent without one note of warning, scattering the wisest calculations of business men, like a whirlwind. Fortunes, apparently the most stable, are hurled down, and plans that promise the most certain success, turn out to be the instrumentalities of ruin the most hopeless. We need not go beyond the history of the last five years, to illustrate our position. In 1857, at a time of the greatest apparent prosperity, when our storehouses were full, when there was abundant demand for our staples all over the world, when our factories and forges were in full career, and all the branches of industry flourished, a sudden storm arose -- a commercial and financial tempest swept in mad fury from the Atlantic to the Pacific, bearing down everything that was not founded on granite and iron-bound, in the resistless rush. Banks suspended; thousands of houses of established credit and reputed wealth were swept away, and bankruptcy overwhelmed hundreds of thousands who had entered upon a career that held out promise of success. City and country suffered alike. Inland trade; and ocean commerce, the manufacturing the mining, the mechanical and agricultural interests, were all involved in the common calamity. That storm passed away; but the ruin it had wrought was seen and felt all over the Republic. Men of the highest business qualifications, by tens of thousands, were overwhelmed in hopeless bankruptcy, crushed beneath mountains of debt that [???] all their energies and [???] them out from every field of enterprise. We do not speak now of mere adventurers, speculators in fortune, who stake everything upon a single cast, but of men earnestly engaged in legitimate pursuits, whose capital was invested in the practical business of the country, and whose labors aided in the forward movement of the world. Capitalists whose fortunes were invested in solid securities, who hazarded nothing in the ventures of commerce or upon the exigencies of trade, and who were disconnected with the productive interests of the country, weathered the storm. It was the active, energetic, practical business men of the country was were shipwrecked and who are still drifting among the breakers, or fast on the shoals of bankruptcy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Bankruptcy Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Bankruptcy Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Bankruptcies', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-06-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/45a48e1f-b836-5087-acff-e2d791a24a80,1025,nyt://article/45a48e1f-b836-5087-acff-e2d791a24a80,

HARDY, dry goods dealer, at No. 332 Bowery, discovered that his store had been broken into on Wednesday night and robbed of $2,000 worth of silks and laces. The Detective Police were notified, and officers FARLEY and EUSTACE examined the premises, finding that the side window and front door had been forced. From the manner in which the burglary had been effected, the Detectives felt confident that the delinquents were DAVID BARTLETT and JOHN WATSON, both noted rogues, and having visited the boarding house, No. 222 Thompson-street, where the burglars had been living since last December, the officers were fortunate enough to find them. At the time the Detectives entered the room, BARTLETT, WATSON, and a man named JOHN WILLIAMS, were engaged in overhauling, assorting and preparing for sale to a receiver of stolen goods the entire proceeds of the burglary, and the two were taken in to custody, after a futile attempt on their part to escape by leaping from the window. The officers also found in the apartment a number of skeleton keys and other implements of rogue-craft, which doubtless had been used in the burglary. The prisoners were taken before Justice CONNOLLY, who committed them for examination. Their arrest was a source of intense surprise to the lady with whom they had been boarding, as their appearance and behavior during the few months they had lived with her was very gentlemanly.

She is a new vessel, and has never been to sea. Before the insurrection of the South she was very fortunately removed from Pensacola to Norfolk, and subsequently from the latter place. Having been for some months on the stocks, the Pensacola was launched at the Warrington Navy-yard on the 13th of August, 1858. She was designed by Mr. JOHN LINTHALL, to whom has been given the designing of the new craft just ordered. Her draught of water is 17 feet, when loaded; her tonnage, 2,158. She will carry 18 nine-inch broadside guns. The cut-water and quarter galleries of the vessel are admirable specimens of naval ornamental architecture; but her distinguishing peculiarity is her capstan, in which a part of the mahogany used by Gen. JACKSON during the defence of New-Orleans is conspicuously placed. This mahogany was part of an old frame or bed on which a Spanish mortar was mounted by ""Old Hickory,"" in 1814, and which, after the declaration of peace, was brought to Pensacola, where it remained for years. The Pensacola cost $82,917 42, while the Richmond, built at Norfolk, and about the same size, cost $126,816 08. The machinery of the former is being constructed by Messrs. DICKERSON & SICKLES.

A malicious and characteristic libel was issued from the Daily News office yesterday, respecting the Park Barracks, to the effect that the small-pox had broken out there, and that the barracks were a pest-house and a nuisance, which should be avoided by our citizens. To show how little confidence is placed in the statements emanating from that paper, an unusually large number of ladles visited the barracks yesterday, and requested as a particular favor, that Capt. GREENE would conduct them to the quarters where the small-pox was raging most fiercely. The Captain escorted them through the barracks, but was obliged to acknowledge his inability to gratify them with the sight of a small-pox patient. It is only necessary to state, which we do on the authority of Capt. GREENE, who has had immediate supervision of the Park Barracks, from the day they were built, thatnot a single case of small-pox, or any other disease, has occurred in the barracks since they were established.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL MILITARY MOVEMENTS.; THE PARK BARRACKS.

They are filled with anxiety and apprehension by the fact that they are left almost entirely without means for their work; and are accordingly forced to the conclusion that, unless the Church should awake to a new sense of duty, its missionary operations must suffer the most serious embarrassment and disaster. It is the estimate of the Treasurer, (see statement below) that $25,000 will be needed before the first of October, in order that the Committee may end its financial year without debt. The Committee cannot but claim that their financial affairs have been conducted with forethought and discretion, and that they are in no way responsible for any embarrassment that may occur. Their operations are carried on at great distances, and cannot be adapted at once to diminished resources at dome. In anticipation, however, of our present difficulties, the Committee, some time since, directed all their operations to be reduced to the lowest possible scale, and everything at the stations is now placed upon the most economical footing. No further reduction can be made without sad injury to the work, and grievous sacrifice of advantages already gained. The Committee cannot believe they will be driven to this. They know that the amount necessary for their entire relief might be raised without the slightest inconvenience to any; and at this time, when we are called even to painful self denial and sacrifice, they cannot but trust that a work so full of love to man, and so dear to the heart of Christ, will be sustained. But it this is to be done, and our operations are to be continued, even on the present reduced scale, a prompt and effective effort is imperatively required.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/08/archives/an-englishman-driven-from-the-slave.html,,"STATES. -- At Bow-street Office in London, on the 18th ult., an elderly man, of gentlemanly appearance and address, who stated that his name was OTTLEY, and that he was formerly an officer in the Royal Artillery applied to Mr. CORRIE for advice under the following circumstances: Mr. OTTLEY stated that he got into the Royal Artillery School at Woolwich, by the influence of the late Duke of York, and, after passing the usual examinations, obtained his commission, and served as an officer of Artillery for twenty-one years. Government offered at that time, about twenty-years back, what was called a ""boon"" to officers who had served for a certain number of years. The so-called ""boon"" was the permission to sell their commissions and the grant of a piece of land in Canada. He accepted the offer, and when he went out to Canada he found that his property was fifteen miles from any human habitation; that the road to it lay for the greater part of the year under three or four feet of snow; and that the land itself was perfectly useless to him, being so covered with timber that it would require an enormous capital to clear it. The only benefit he ever got from it was, that he cut down a quantity of the timber, which he made into two rafts, floated them down the river and sold them. No doubt the property might have been made valuable if he had had capital to improve it. He then became manager and editor of the Ottawa Advertiser newspaper, after which he removed to Stratton Island, and became professor of mathematics and military tactics at Stratton Island College. Subsequently he edited the New-York Picayune for four years, and more recently he became editor of a newspaper in New-Orleans. But when the recent disturbances broke out he was required to take an oath of allegiance to the new Southern (Secession) Confederacy, and to abjure his own country. This he refused to do; but finding that several persons who had so refused had been hanged on suspicion of being Abolitionists, and that others were ignomoniously expelled, he was obliged to make his escape and return to England. After an absence of forty years from London, he could find none of his old friends, and could get no employment. Mr. CORRIE regretted that he could do no more than give him some temporary assistance from the poor-box, and hoped that he might get some employment shortly.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AN ENGLISHMAN DRIVEN FROM THE SLAVE', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AN ENGLISHMAN DRIVEN FROM THE SLAVE', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/afa92b5c-f47b-5234-994e-04640342fd2a,414,nyt://article/afa92b5c-f47b-5234-994e-04640342fd2a,

Whatever may be said of the education of the people, of their fitness for self-government, and of their action in shaping the course of events, it is nevertheless true that societies and nations are judged rather from the talent and principles of their leaders than from another standard. It is on that account that the French have exercised and still exercise on the Continent of Europe that influence which no other nation enjoys to the same degree, and it needs only a look at the copious manner in which the English Press, so jealous of English institutions and manners, records all that transpires in Paris, in science, politics and literature, to know that it is not overrated. French editors and writers are, taken as a whole, men of talent and principle, and though their journals are not so well informed in the news department and miscellaneous matters as the English, they generally exhibit a loftier tone, a higher morality, less passion, and a deeper insight of men and things.

The remonstrances of a number of leading merchants, against the 5 cent. war premium on marine risks, were carefully considered. It was agreed to reduce the extra rate, temporarily, to 2 1/2 cent., and to submit the question for final settlement to a formal meeting of the Board, as early as practicable. Mr. RICHARD LATHERS, President of the Great Western Company, visited the Produce Exchange during business hours, for the purpose of making known what had been agreed upon. He communicated the information to some of his personal acquaintances and a number of the members of the Commercial Association, privately. It was suggested to him that the merchants at large would be pleased to hear directly of the action of the Underwriters, and that as they were then assembled on the floor of the Exchange, an excellent opportunity of publicly reporting the news was presented. Acting on this suggestion, Mr. LATHERS, without consulting any of the officers of the Association, took his stand on the President's desk, and proceeded to explain what the Underwriters had done, and why they did so. He announced the reduction of the war rate to 2 1/2 cent., which was received with cheers; but the expression of his opinion, as to what policy Great Britain was likely to adopt in reference to privateering, did not meet with much favor. Yet, Mr. LATHERS asserted it was the belief of the Underwriters that the English nation would discountenance the privateers of the C.S.A., at least as far as to exclude them, and their prizes, from all British ports. Although entertaining this opinion, the Underwriters deemed it sound policy to prepare for the worst; hence, the claim of a war rate.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War Premium on Marine Risks.; THE MERCHANTS AND THE UNDERWRITERS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War Premium on Marine Risks.; THE MERCHANTS AND THE UNDERWRITERS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/28c987aa-495e-524e-b733-b2af01845dd0,1183,nyt://article/28c987aa-495e-524e-b733-b2af01845dd0,

A great fact in Natural History, the existence of which has been persistently denied by Southern ethnologists, is in course of demonstration -- to wit: that a negro loves freedom just as much as does a white man, and that whenever he has a chance he will run for it. By and by it may further appear that he will even fight for it. The war that is moving South may, in spite of every precaution, put ideas into the heads of the slave, and teach him a lesson that may trouble the repose of the masters, in spite of both North and South.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A FOOLISH REMEDY FOR AN IMAGINARY EVIL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A FOOLISH REMEDY FOR AN IMAGINARY EVIL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b62f87d-9158-56a7-97cf-6570e72d4c4f,181,nyt://article/5b62f87d-9158-56a7-97cf-6570e72d4c4f,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/09/archives/the-surrender-of-texas.html,,"When Gen. TWIGGS ordered the surrender of the forts and munitions of war under his command in the military department of Texas, every officer and every seldier of the Southern forces knew that he was a traitor, and that they were absolved by his treason from their duty of obedience to his orders. They knew that they would have been justified in tearing from his shoulders the epaulettes he had dishonored, and sending him home a prisoner, even in irons. There were one hundred and twenty-one officers and over three thousand Federal troops in Texas at the time, who might have concentrated, offering an amount of resistance which no force that could have been mustered by that State could have overcome. There were plenty of arms, plenty of ammunition, plenty of equipments of every kind, as well for garrison duty as for long marches, plenty of supplies, plenty of money for their maintenance, and, above all, plenty of loyalty and courage on the part of the soldiery. They were, moreover, veteran troops, accustomed to long marches and the hardships and perils incident to the border service. Had they been drawn together, as they might easily have been, they could have marched to the coast, where they could have been met by transports to convey them North, or might have hewn their way through Western Arkansas to Kansas, and home in that direction. There was no lack of officers to command them. Col. WAITE, who succeeded TWIGGS, took command the very day after the treason of TWIGGS was promulgated, and before a gun had been given up or a fort surrendered. He was clothed with ample authority to concentrate all the forces in Texas, and use them as the interests or the honor of the country might require. Instead of this, they were permitted to remain in scattered detachments, and ordered, at last, to surrender in detail to the rebel troops as prisoners of war, to be released only on condition of taking an oath not to serve against the Confederacy during the war. With this surrender, passed into the hands of the traitors about thirty-five thousand stand of arms, near thirty pieces of mounted, and more than forty pieces of heavy artillery, with munitions of war, including cavalry horses, wagons, tents, mules, ammunition, and provisions, to the estimated value of near two millions, and between fifty and sixty thousand dollars in Federal gold, provided for the maintenance and pay of the troops. In addition to this, every fort, arsenal and military post in Texas, were handed over to embolden treason and strengthen the hands of rebellion; and the marvel of it all is, that this vast surrender was made without firing one gun or striking one blow, even on the defensive. How shall this be accounted for, consistently with the fidelity and bravery of the officers in command, after the villainy of TWIGGS became manifest? Their general officer was a traitor; but his treason was discovered, and his command superseded before an article had been actually surrendered, and no principle of official morality required loyal men to carry out his treasonable compacts. They were away from the central power of the Government; but they were a part of the Government, and a power within themselves sufficient to resist aggression and hew their way home. They were ignorant of the plans or designs of the Administration at Washington, and their means of communication were cut off -- still their own sense of duty, their instincts of right remained. They knew the fact that it was treason that demanded of them to lay down their arms, and, knowing this, a soldier's duty would teach them resistance, and a soldier's courage and patriotism would have made it successful.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Surrender of Texas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Surrender of Texas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/95dd5952-9dc0-5484-9122-2a3001331e97,1101,nyt://article/95dd5952-9dc0-5484-9122-2a3001331e97,

These candidates, it was claimed, should be supported, irrespective of party organizations, as the peculiar friends and upholders of the Union as it is. Their banner was the Stars and Stripes simply, and around it were invited to rally all who loved their country, all who regarded this great Republic, reaching from ocean to ocean, and from the lakes to the gulf, as a solid indivisible whole, who were against the madness of Southern secession, and what they were pleased to term the sectionalism of the North; who were willing to cut loose from the corruptions of old politicalorganizations on the hunt for spoils, and of forming anew into one great political brotherhood, of which JOHN BELL was to be the head, and whose watchword was the Union, in its integrity, against all assailants from whatever quarter. Around this standard rallied thousands of conservative citizens, and hundreds of thousands of young and ardent men, whose hearts were imbued with patriotism, and who rejected the party drill and party machinery of the times, as standing in the way of the prosperity and endangering the peace of the Union. JOHN BELL was the peculiar champion and embodiment of the Union sentiment throughout the nation. He was to strike down secession at the South and abolition at the North. He was to grasp these disturbing elements in his fist and choke them into everlasting silence. He was to repair and solidify the foundations of the Union, so that neither earthquake nor tempest could shake them. With these high professions, and this lofty political creed, he entered upon the canvass. His followers struggled valiantly, proclaiming with an earnestness that evinced the sincerity of their faith, that the loyalty and patriotism of their chief was the only cure for the evils of the times, and his election the only sure guarantee of the salvation of the Republic. The American people decided against them, and JOHN BELL was defeated.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Where is John Bell?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Where is John Bell?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ccaaea66-49fd-55e3-9b42-b080200f5591,1027,nyt://article/ccaaea66-49fd-55e3-9b42-b080200f5591,

On the 23d of May the secession ordinance was submitted to a vote of the people, and Mr. STRUNK, supposing that he would be permitted to vote as he pleased, when he gave his name at the election poll, and was asked how he intended to vote, replied for the Union. Squire MCCLUNG, who was one of the commissioners to receive the votes, remarked that it was the first Union vote polled that day. As he said this, WM. HOWARD, a violent Secessionist, seized Mr. STRUNK by the throat, dragged him some distance, to a bank six feet high, over which he was thrown. With the assistance of others, HOWARD then dragged him to a pond, into which they threw him. He crawled out, and was pushed back two or three times. HOWARD drew a pistol from his pocket, and would have shot Mr. STRUNK, but for the interference of a person in the crowd. It was finally proposed that he should have three hours to leave the place, and he did leave within the specified time, abandoning all his property but such small articles as he was able to sell to the neighbors, who sympathized with him. One of them loaned him money, to enable him to reach Washington, which he did by the way of the Manassas Gap and Fairfax Court-house.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HOW A MAN WAS TREATED IN EASTERN VIRGINIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HOW A MAN WAS TREATED IN EASTERN VIRGINIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cccd2d15-5add-5ed8-83b4-57e557c9d43d,327,nyt://article/cccd2d15-5add-5ed8-83b4-57e557c9d43d,

That they will attack our line of intrenchments is now regarded as extremely improbable, as they cannot hope to bring against it any force which would insure success. This line, therefore, is sufficient to hold them in check while Gen. PATTERSON's command from Chambersburgh and the column of troops from Ohio are driving the rebels from Harper's Ferry.

In addition to this first and very obvious difficulty, there are a variety of minor obstacles to be overcome. It was never intended that Niagara should be played upon, as ""a harp of a thousand strings"" -- the name doesn't rhyme well. Two ingenious gentlemen, however, have overcome this latter difficulty.

It has been materially curtailed, and is now an affair which may be enjoyed without stopping up too late o' nights. All the dialogue, which had no direct bearing on the action of the piece, has been excised, and the comic situations and scenes, in consequence, succeed each other with with great rapidity. Mr. BLAKE's part -- although still unworthy of his great talents as an actor -- has been curtailed and compressed into reasonable limits. His great reputation insures for the performance an amount of consideration which otherwise it might not command. Mr. SOTHERN is admirable as the two Dundrearys, and his changes are as remarkable for their rapidity as they are for their separate realizations of character. The other parts are rendered with great quickness, and this, with the admirable scenery, has won a pronounced success for the piece. We notice several improvements in progress at the Winter Garden, conducted especially for the comfort of its frequenters. A wide area is in course of construction around the parquette and upper circle, by which a system of free ventilation will be established superior to anything of the kind now known in a City theatre.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/09/archives/privateering.html,,"Some centuries ago, when victories were won by the mere power of endurance and physical strength of combatants, when the batile-axe and the sword, wielded by stalwart arms, held the place of cannon and the rifle of the present times, the soldier was valued in proportion to his strength and his ability to deal or ward heavy blows in his encounters with the enemy. In those times, men of gigantic strength and inured to military service, called around them followers as strong and skilled in the use of arms as themselves, and offered their services to engage in the wars of whatever Prince chose to employ them. All they asked was a commission to save them from the penalties attached to mere robbery, taking their chances of pay out of the plunder they might be able to gather from the enemy against whom they stipulated to fight, looking to their commissions to secure to themselves the immunities of prisoners of war in case of their capture. These marauding bands sallied out against the enemy for their own personal emolument. They plundered cities and sacked towns, without reference to the sacredness of private property, and the robbery of peaceful citizens was regarded as a source of legitimate spoil. More adventurers, engaging in national strifes on private account, they had small regard for the amenities even of war. Humanity had no place in their creed. Whatever brought gain to their treasury was legitimate capture. Whoever could pay ransom was made prisoner, and if those who could not, were spared, it was through caprice rather than principle. The lust of gain stimulated their activity, while it obliterated all the softer qualities of their nature. Thus in the mediaeval wars of Europe, the belligerent nations swarmed with these land privateers, who had small regard for the rights of neutrals, and who did not always respect the rights even of those whose commission they held. Border towns suffered from their raids, and when plunder of the enemy failed them, they levied military contributions on their friends.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Privateering.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Privateering.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f38d20de-3dd8-52da-a577-8dc43da9455d,1018,nyt://article/f38d20de-3dd8-52da-a577-8dc43da9455d,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/10/archives/cotton-culture-in-africa.html,,"From the unsettled condition of affairs in the Cotton States, and the fears in regard to the future cotton supply in England, it has been determined to open new sources, which shall relieve Manchester from the contingencies of a servile insurrection, and the dependence upon the Southern States for the principal staple of British manufactures. The discoveries of Dr. LIVINGSTONE in Southeastern Africa induced the British Government to furnish him with ample appliances to develop the resources of that region, with an eye to its capacities for cotton growing. In the course of twenty or thirty years, no doubt, considerable quantities of cotton will be exported thence; but, as it will take years to civilize that portion of Africa, no large amount can be depended upon from the neighborhood of the Zambezi. The researches of BURTON, SPEKE, PETHERICK, BARTH, DU CHAILLU, and others, have demonstrated that the whole of inter-tropical Africa is a cotton-producing region. It was, however, the fortune of our countryman, Mr. BOWEN, to describe to the American public the remarkable country of Yoruba, the field of his missionary labors. Though a portion of the country was traversed by MUNGO PARK, and noticed by the LANDERS, yet its true condition was imperfectly known until the publication of BOWEN's account of his labors and researches. These have supplied us with a definite idea of what the native Africans are doing on their own soil, and give a higher impression of native character than we have generally received. There is no doubt, in fact, that the Valley of the Niger is destined to play an important part in the great drama of the future.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cotton Culture in Africa.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cotton Culture in Africa.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'AFRICA', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cotton', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-06-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b004019b-4f36-58eb-925a-ded9432e010a,929,nyt://article/b004019b-4f36-58eb-925a-ded9432e010a,

We could scarcely have looked for so speedy a corroboration of our argument that this arm of the service would have to be reinforced, before the active movements of the mounted scouts, attached in such numbers to the rebel force, could be reciprocated and neutralized. Unfortunately the war establishment of the country has been kept up on so strict a peace footing as to leave very few of Uncle Sam's bold, accomplished dragoons at liberty to respond to the call of the Commander-in-Chief. The entire cavalry arm of the regular service is not more than sufficient to support a body of twenty-five thousand infantry through a single campaign. Of what there are, more than one-half must be retained upon the frontier, to keep the Indians in check; for the red man laughs at any but a mounted foe; consequently, not more than two thousand five hundred horsemen can be gathered for immediate duty where Gen.

Gen. SCOTT's Infantry Tactics, Major GILHAM's Manual of Instructions for Volunteers and Militia, Col. HARDEE's Tactics, Capt. VIELE's Hand-Book for Active Service, GIBBON's Artillerist's Manual, BENTON on Ordnance and Gunnery, and many others that might be named, form the only stock now in demand at the book-stores, and they are works which, in their practical application to the purposes intended, do honor to the service that produces them.

The use of small shot they consider unworthy the skill of the hunter. They bring down a squirrel from the top of a pine so lofty that the game, is scarcely visible to ordinary eye-sight. The men, in their daily work of cutting timber, receive more or less ax-wounds, and for this reason several of them were rejected on inspection. They grumbled immensely at their rejection, and are determined to fight, and for this purpose are seeking admission to other regiments. One man who was rejected lost his temper, and offered to bet the inspector that he would walk fifty miles without complaining of weariness, and not eat or drink anything until the work was accomplished. More than this, he offered to double the first wager that he could pierce the eyes of JEFF. DAVIS, or any other traitor, with his rifle, at a distance of two hundred and fifty yards. The inspecting officer was so impressed by the man's remonstrance against rejection, that he declined the bet and ordered him to fall back into the ranks. Five of the rejected men exhibited their skill with the rifle at Philadelphia, by knocking a five cent piece from a split stick at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards.

The plan of the campaign which is to extinguish the rebellion is wisely kept by the Government from common knowledge. We can only calculate the events that are to follow from those before us. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/11/archives/the-operations-in-virginia.html,,"The plan of the campaign which is to extinguish the rebellion is wisely kept by the Government from common knowledge. We can only calculate the events that are to follow from those before us. There is reason to believe that Virginia is to be at once purged of the insurgent army, and that in due time Tennessee will be occupied and New-Orleans eventually captured. From such general indications we may infer details. It is clearly not the policy and not the purpose to leave any considerable body of the rebels in the rear of our army. Wherever they are posted they must be dislodged, before the line of operations is carried further southward. For this reason, and not because the post of Harper's Ferry is of strategic importance, it has been thought indispensable to beat the rebels from that position, and to make secure the western communications along the valley of the Potomac. It has also doubtless occurred to our military authorities that the safety of Washington depends very largely upon the strength of our force along the line of that river. Of the real force at the service of the insurgent leaders, it is probable that the Government knows as little as the public. In the moderated language of their later manifestos, they apparently abandon the thought of seizing the Federal Capital; but this language may have been dictated by the policy of slackening the haste with which the defences of Washington are strengthened; and of diverting attention from the real point of attack. Let us bear in mind that all our knowledge of the numbers and plans of the rebels are obtained from those unreliable and contradictory witnesses, ""gentlemen just from the seat of war,"" who pour their reports into the ear of confiding correspondents. Practically we know nothing of their programme; and we shall have made inadequate preparation to encounter it, if precaution against all possible variations are neglected. The breadth of the Potomac, the possession of the bridges by an imposing national force, and the impossibility of effecting a passage against opposition so formidable, must prevent a direct assault; but the feasibility of turning the flank of the Washington army by crossing at a higher point with a powerful body of troops, cutting off direct communication with the North, and surrounding the Capital by a rapid coup de main, has no doubt been entertained at Richmond, and we do not know that it has been relinquished. Doubts upon this subject have most probably suggested the movement of troops now in course of execution towards Leesburgh, Point of Recks, Harper's Ferry and Williamsport, with a view to guarding against a surprise of this damaging character.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Operations in Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Operations in Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/281ca2c6-5428-52ba-be73-4e9815eea191,845,nyt://article/281ca2c6-5428-52ba-be73-4e9815eea191,

If the Federal Government has adopted this course, it has acted most unwisely. The question of recognition of a State enjoying de facto independence rests upon considerations which are too well understood and appreciated to be affected by any threat of this description. England, at least, will not be deterred from acting with justice either to North or South when the subject of recognition has to be decided. It is the duty of the two belligerents to diminish as far as possible the pressure of war upon neutral commerce. We do not believe that this object can be gained by having recourse to the barbarous practice of privateering. The Americans, according to their theory, are perfectly justified in employing privateers; but when these vessels are required to enforce the highest bellligerent rights -- those of blockade and search -- the contending parties may eventually find to their cost that they have acted not only in a manner unnecessarily injurious and oppressive to neutral commerce, but one calculated to alienate the sympathies of the people of Europe. At present it seems that the invaluable commerce of this country is to be placed at the absolute mercy of either belligerent. We trust and hope that England may be kept out of the quarrel, but to accomplish this object the British Government must take and maintain a firm and resolute attitude, and adequately protect British commerce from that system of rapiue which, since the determination of the Congress, is in reality only piracy under another same. The Federal Government bas, at the present time, too much upon its hands to indulge in vain and idle threats. Let it by its power reduce the rebellious States to obedience, before it attempts to dictate a course of policy to foreign Powers -- those Powers who hitherto have honestly and studiously abstained from intervening in the contest.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'John Bull not to be Bullied.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'John Bull not to be Bullied.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Post', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a2f7d36-a322-5977-9556-a856d7a6ec90,355,nyt://article/2a2f7d36-a322-5977-9556-a856d7a6ec90,

"The superiority of breach-loading cannon is practically acknowledged by the numerous and costly efforts made to produce them. The Armstrong gun, with all those breech-loading. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/11/archives/breechloading-cannon.html,,"The superiority of breach-loading cannon is practically acknowledged by the numerous and costly efforts made to produce them. The Armstrong gun, with all those breech-loading imperfections that require as many machinists as artillerists to serve it, is adhered to as the gun of England; and WHITWORTH, CLAY, and men of that stamp, representing not only the highest mechanical experience and facilities, but unlimited means for experiment, are straining every resource to produce practicable breech-loaders. The obvious features of this system are, the protection of breech-loading gunners within shot-proof batteries on gun-boats, etc., and the greater simplicity and cheapness of the projectile, which is compressed rather than expanded into the grooves by the explosion; in addition to which we may safely grant that high military and engineering authorities would not thus persistently adhere to it if its advantages were not manifold and decided. Yet, however excellent the principle may be of putting the charge in at the breech of a gun, there have been serious practical objections, wholly of a mechanical character, the formidable cause of them all being the expansion of the metal by the heat of repeated explosions. To load at the breech, a hole of some sort, large enough to take in the charge, must be opened from without to the bore or chamber, and closed again before firing, by some arrangement tight and strong enough to resist the whole force of the explosion, and yet moveable with such facility that it can be instantly opened by hand, to put in the succeeding charge. This stopper, whether it be a wedge, a plug, or a cap, must have a perfect joint with the barrel of the gun, for the gas formed by the explosion will leak, or rather blow, with great velocity out of an aperture immeasurably small, not only wasting so much of its mechanical effect, but gradually cutting away the metal itself, and enlarging its vent in geometrical ratio. Any leakage soon destroys the apparatus. The stopper must, therefore, not only fit, surface to surface, but it must be held in contact with a resistance sufficient to hold an expansive power of 5,000 feet per second, and then it must be easily detachable, or the arm will still be useless. It would appear to be difficult enough to produce such an apparatus out of materials which, when once formed, would retain their shape and size. But when we consider that all metals expand differently in degree by heat, and that the same part may expand more and differently in one place than in another, it is evident that a loose joint may soon become immovable, or a very tight joint hopelessly loose and leaky, depending on which part of the apparatus is most exposed to heat. Even railway bars laid end to end and touching continuously, expand so much as to throw themselves from the sleepers, by the heat of the sun, while the temperature of the gases resulting from the ignition of gunpowder, is some 4,300°. It is therefore impracticable to place a revolving or movable chamber, or any stopper of large dimensions, and subject to this heat, within or between any solid parts not so exposed; and yet, whatever does stop the hole where the charge was put in, must be as strongly and rigidly connected to the barrel, as the molecules of the barrel are connected by cohesion, in order to resist the explosion and prevent leakage. To this end, the plan generally adopted, is to fasten the stopper by a screw of sufficient strength and dimensions, by which the expansion of the parts may be adjusted. In the Armstrong gun, the bore extends entirely through the breech. Into this bore, from the top, outside, a mortice is made to receive a wedge which is inserted behind the charge after the latter is put in. The wedge, thus resists, or rather, transfers to the rear of the breech, the force of the explosion; and to keep it tightly against the chamber in which the explosion occurs, it is forced up from the rear by a screw passing into the bore in the breech, and is thus always held in contact, whatever may be the expansion of the parts by heat. To put in a new charge the screw is withdrawn so much that the wedge can be lifted out. In practice, however, the wedge cannot be kept tightly enough in place to prevent the leakage of gas, without it is jammed into such close contact that it cannot be unscrewed again with the necessary facility. Again, the expansion of metals by heat may be irregular; one part of the stopper may be tight while the rest is not in contact. For instance, CLAY's gun has a large excentric, hollow breech, into which an immense plug is screwed from the rear. In this screw-plug is a continuation of the bore of the gun, through which the charge is put into the chamber from the rear. The plug is then screwed in a half turn further, so that the hole in it, through which the charge was put in, is moved away from the bore of the gun, and the solid flat end of the plug jammed tightly over the end of the bore. This goes very smoothly for a time; but since the parts of the plug and of the breech where the explosion occurs, get quite hot, while the rest is cool, only the top section of the chamber is covered by the plug, and the screw works hard after firing a few rounds. The same thing would occur with a Colt's revolver of cannon dimensions, as any one may imagine. It is evident that no mechanical adjustment can remedy the grand defect. Some new principle must be struck out.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Breech-Loading Cannon.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Breech-Loading Cannon.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4eff5119-6332-5748-91a2-9c5707b8586d,1523,nyt://article/4eff5119-6332-5748-91a2-9c5707b8586d,

This is rendered the more probable from the fact that a company of sappers and miners, with a large quantity of intrenching tools, accompanies the command. Simultaneous with this movement up the Maryland bank of the Potomac, it is believed that a portion of the troops now in Virginia will also move up on the Virginia bank, as a large train of baggage wagons yesterday crossed over from Washington.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/11/archives/the-subject-in-parliament-remarks-of-lord-bougham.html,,"In the House of Lords on the 27th ult., on the order of the day for going into committee on the Offences in Territories near Sierra Leone Prevention Bill, Lord BROUHAM said he highly approved this bill. He thought it absolutely essential that extension should be given to the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone. He considered that this bill improved the constitution of that colony, and tended to increase the benefits which we had given by it to the unhappy people of Africa, being, as Mr. PITT once observed, a very small compensation for all the evils which he had been a party to inflicting upon them. Those evils had been continued to the greatest extent, and in a far greater degree than any act of ours, by the extension of that jurisdiction, how beneficial soever, could tend to remedy -- he alluded to the atrocious conduct of Spain in that increase of the African slave trade, which, notwithstanding the treaties entered into and the turns of money actually paid as compensation, had increased from 12,000 slaves imported in 1857 to 16,000 in 1858, and to no less than 30,000 in the year 1859. Now we found that Spain was increasing her dominions in the West Indies; and he was by no means satisfied with the assurance given him, when he last brought this matter before the House, that there was no intention of extending slavery, and thereby also, as a consequence, the slave trade, to that territory. Having had access to the decree of annexation by the Spanish Government since he last addressed their lordships, he found it stated that ""it was impossible to reject the prayers of a whole nation imploring readmission into the bosom of the mother country. So said the Spanish Government. What said the Governor of Hayti, Gen. GEFEBARD? He distinctly called that statement an absolute falsehood. He denied that there was any imploring of the people there to be admitted into the bosom of the mother country, and added that in their circumstances it was utterly impossible that the free will of the people could be known; for Gen SANTANA had established the reign of terror so entirely over them that ""they,"" to use Gen. GEFFARD's owe expression, ""trembling under it, could manifest no free will."" The decree stated that the annexation of San Domingo had taken place, and the same decree went on to say, -- ""Already the Spanish flag is flying under that sky where the immortal COLUMBUS had borne it, with the Gospel in his hand, to plant that civilization the most glorious of all then known."" Royal memories were proverbially short; else, had the Spanish Government recollected their treatment of COLUMBUS, they would have been ashamed to name that man whose immortal services they had required by sending him home in chains, which were struck off, no doubt, in compliance with the popular indignation, but which he required to be buried with him when, a few years afterwards, he died in absolute want. It was also a sample of their short memory that they referred to ""the Gospel which he carried in his hand,"" and which the Spanish Government desecrated by a series of constant ruthless persecutions. And as to the civilization which they bragged of having, given to the New World, it was testified by their exterminating the natives by packs of bloodhounds. He observed that the decree said, ""Slavery, the inevitable evil of the other colonies, is altogether unnecessary for the cultivation of that fertile territory."" Was San Domingo more fertile than Cuba? Nothing of the kind. And it went on to add that ""there is no intention of reestablishing Slavery there."" He did not know what the intention might be. Perhaps there was no intention of establishing the Slave-trade when the Spanish Government bargained for a sum of money for putting it down instead of extending it, and yet they had extended it. The means they took to carry on the Government of their new acquisition were not such as gave him any great confidence in their want of intention to establish Slavery there. For to whom did they intrust the execution of this decree? The execution of the decree of annexution was intrusted to the Captain-General of Cuba, who was to take the necessary means of carrying it into execution. Now, it there was a Captain General in all the world whom he should trust less than another for not planting Slavery again in San Domingo, it would be the Captain General of Cuba. He should have absolute confidence in him for extending the establishment of Slavery in that part of the Spanish dominions. He regarded with the utmost possible surprise this conduct of the Spanish Government, and, recollecting their conduct on the Slave trade in the island of Cuba, he was not in the least degree moved by the disavowal of their intention to introduce Slavery into San Domingo, being perfectly convinced that they would reestablish it there if they had any occasion or temptation to do so Cuba had now been for years and years a refuge for all the distressed nobles of the highest rank at the Court of Madrid when sunk in poverty by their own extravagance and loaded with debt, who returned in a year or two afterwards full of plunder, which plunder consisted of the fees paid to them for the evasion of the abolition law, and the introduction of slaves.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The subject in Parliament Remarks of Lord Bougham.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The subject in Parliament Remarks of Lord Bougham.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee164f59-926e-5898-a6f1-d0ddf6ad57cd,916,nyt://article/ee164f59-926e-5898-a6f1-d0ddf6ad57cd,

RUSSELL brought up copies of a correspondence with the Government of the United States of America. The noble lord said: In moving that this correspondence should lie upon the table, it may be convenient to the House, and especially so to the commercial interests in this country, that I should state the substance of the correspondence which has lately taken place with the Government of the United States of America, with regard to the blockade. On the 19th of April, the President of the United States issued a notification that it was intended to institute a blockade of the ports of the seven States which had seceded; and on the 27th of April another notification was issued, announcing that it was intended to blockade the ports of North Carolina and Virginia. When Lord LYONS applied for an official notification of the establishment and commencement of the blockade, he was told by the Secretary of State that it was not usual to make such a notification, but that it would be made by the different naval commanders, at the several ports, when the blockade was instituted. It results from the correspondence, that the blockade is to be notified in that manner, and that one blockade has already been so notified, viz.: that of the ports of Virginia and North Carolina, by flag officer PRENDERGAST, who has declared that he is in a situation to make an efficient blockade of those ports. There has been no notification of a similar kind with regard to the ports of the other States which it was declared were also to be blockaded, The rules, so far as Lord LYONS has been able to ascertain them, and of which he has given an account to Admiral MILNE, commanding the squadron in those waters, are, first, that the notification is in each place to be made by the naval officer commanding the squadron or the ships which institute the blockade; and, in the next place, that fifteen days are to be allowed, after the establishment of the blockade, for vessels to come out of the ports. It appears that whether they were loaded or not at the time the blockade was established, provided they come out within fifteen days, their passage is to be allowed. On the other hand it is not permitted by the United States' Government that vessels should be sent to ports which are blockaded for the purpose of bringing away the property of British subjects, or the vessels or property of other nations. An application for such permission was made, to which the Secretary of State replied that if such a facility were granted it would be used by American citizens wishing to bring away property. Lord Lyons ends his communication to Admiral Milne very properly. He says that if the blockade is carried into effect according to the rules established by the law of nations we must of course conform to it; and that we can only see that the blockade is sufficient and regular.

Our army has had its first reverse. Ordered to make a night advance upon the enemy's lines to the Westward of Fortress Monroe, some three thousand of the national troops marched courageously upon the errand; and confiding in the presumed knowledge of their officers -- accomplished military skill was not expected -- marched into the very jaws of death. Their misadventures were not due to any heedlessness on their part, or to any deficiency in the qualities which make good soldiers. They fought both friends and foes with equal resolution; and only retired, when the exhaustion of ammunition in the presence of a powerful enemy, strongly intrenched, and with every advantage of position, rendered a further contest impossible. The fact that they retreated without panic or disorder, carrying their wounded and their guns with them, is the best proof of the calm courage and self-control which governed their movement. The loss of life, and the number injured, presents a painful catalogue; but it is a record of soldierly heroism, which must forever set at rest all doubt as to the fitness of our people for the most hazardous exposure of the battle-field, and for the encounter of danger in its most startling forms. Let us do homage to the discipline and fortitude of our brave fellows, who, defenceless for two hours under the enemy's fire, only retreated when their incompetent commander gave the tardy word.

The outfit of the regiment was complete, and highly creditable to Yankee forethought. The uniform is fatigue gray, and each man has, in addition, a blouse and a light felt hat. The two flank companies are armed with Sharpe's rifles, and the rest with the regulation musket, which will probably be exchanged for Enfield rifles. Like the other three regiments from the State, the Fourth is provided with twenty-four baggage-wagons and ambulances, besides horses for most of the Line Officers. The Regiment has been encamped at Hartford three weeks, and is mustered into the United States service for three years. Their motto is the Hartford City motto, ""Post nubila Phoebus."" They carry 60,000 ball cartridges, of which 10,000 are for Sharpe's rifles. Col. WOODHOUSE, who commands the regiment, held a Lieutenant's commission in the New-England Ninth Regiment, during the Mexican War, and was at the storming of Chapultepec.

It has furnished four Colonels and an Acting-Brigadier-General, (Col. DURYEE,) besides any quantity of Captains, Lieutenants, and non-commissioned officer. The following list is by no meant complete, but will give some idea of the wide field over which the discipline of the Seventh is to be extended through the acknowledged skill of its officers.

Gen. BUTLER, having heard that the rebels were engaged there in throwing up intrenchments, determined to dislodge them, and for this purpose detailed the Albany Regiment, commanded by Col. TOWNSEND, DURYEE's Zouaves, and the Seventh Regiment, (German,) commanded by Col. BENDIX, together with a detachment of United States Artillery, commanded by Lieut. GREBBLE, with four 12-pound howitzers, the whole numbering some three thousand, under command of Brig.-Gen. PIERCE. The troops moved on the expedition about midnight on Sunday night, those from Hampton crossing Hampton Creek on batteaux manned by members of the Naval Brigade. Owing to an unfortunate mistake relative to signals, two of the regiments came in collision in the darkness while on the way, and fired into each other, under the mutual supposition that they were enemies. The casualties from this event, however, were not considerable. After the mistake was rectified, the entire force moved on Great Bethel, where the enemy was encountered in much larger force than was anticipated, strongly intrenched, and having heavy ordnance, several pieces of which were rifled cannon. Several attempts tempts were made to carry the position, in which our troops behaved in the most gallant manner, but for lack of a sufficiency of artillery and ammunition, this enterprise had finally to be abandoned, with a loss of about 30 killed and 100 wounded. The withdrawal of our troops was executed in good order, and the enemy appears to have had no disposition to pursue them. A list of the killed and wounded, so far as they are all present known, is given elsewhere. The losses on the part of the rebels, if any, are unknown. A rumor reaches us from Washington that Gen. BUTLER on Monday night made another attack on the rebel batteries, and carried them. The rumor is quite likely to be true.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb46dcd2-43af-5cf9-b236-c0ba9f896644,1581,nyt://article/cb46dcd2-43af-5cf9-b236-c0ba9f896644,

"Katharine Thompson vs. James Laing This action, which was tried before Mr. Justice Moncrief and a jury on the 27th of March, 1861, and on the plaintiff's case the complaint was dismissed. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/12/archives/evidence-may-husband-and-wife-testify-in-behalf-of-each-other-in.html,,"Katharine Thompson vs. James Laing -- This action, which was tried before Mr. Justice Moncrief and a jury on the 27th of March, 1861, and on the plaintiff's case the complaint was dismissed. The action was brought to recover damages for the non-performance of a contract for the stone-work upon four houses on Thirtieth-street in this City. The answer alleges that the contract was obtained through fraudulent representations; and that owing to other contractors for the same work being in possession of the building, under plaintiff's authority. defendant was prevented from the performance of his contract. On the trial of this cause the husband of the plaintiff was offered as a witness in her behalf and was rejected, on the ground, that he not being a party to the suit his evidence did not come within the purview of the act of 1860. To this the plaintiff excepted, and on this appeal is made the principal question in the case. It is contended by the appellant that it was clearly the intent of tae legislature, in the act of 1860 to allow husband and wife to be witnesses on behalf of each other. That the Legislature, by its acts giving to a married woman the right to bring an action in her own name, with respect to her separate property, without joining her husband in the action, clearly intended, by the Act of 1860. that it was her right to have the same facilities for obtaining testimony as any other suitor in a Court of justice. That so for as husband and wife are excluded from testifying to such facts as may disclose any communication between them, with reference to the subject matter of the action, it is right and proper; but their testimony in other respects should be admitted as competent. There are, as yet, no authorities bearing directly upon the point in this State; but in England; under the State of 27th Victoria, one law is very similar to the one this state, and there appear to be decisions bearing more directly upon the subject, which have been quoted in support of this portion.

The defendant scouts the idea of being indebted to the plaintiff in any such amount, and alleges a tender of the amount he thought due the plaintiff. One of the principal defences, however, in this case, is the allegation of eviction. It seems that there is a water-closet upon the premises, from which defendant alleges he was evicted, being prevented from the full use, occupation, and enjoyment thereef.

How far he may have been deceived by his surface intercourse with the ""gentlemen planters"" of the seceded States, or how far their ""elegant hospitality"" may have influenced his calmer judgment, we have no means of knowing; but this much we think we may safely assert, that whatever the views or sentiments of the aristocratic few in some of these States may be, the idea of a ""Constitutional monarchy"" has no place in the thoughts of the people. Faith in republican institutions, in the democratic principle, is as much a fixed and permanent fact in the minds of the Southern masses, as in any other portion of the Union. However the fallacy of a primary allegiance to their States may have overcome their loyalty to the Republic, yet the theory of their revolt is based in no respect upon a present or remote return to monarchical rule. That idea, outside of South Carolina at all events, is entirely obsolete in the American mind. The Union may, at some remote period, but not now, be shattered into petty States; but when that time comes, and this great Republic shall be severed, each fragment, as it falls, will be a Republic -- weak and feeble it may be, but still a Republic. Chaos and confusion may prevail, and the reign of demagogues be substituted in the place of legitimate authority, but whatever of gangrene and rottenness there may be in the substance, the form will still be republican. They may be cursed as a large portion of the South is to-day, with a terrorism, under a vitiated popular sentiment mightier than constitutions, more powerful than legislative enactments; a despotism that crushes freedom of speech, of opinion and action; but the pretence of its usurpations will be the maintenance of democratic liberty, the defence of republican institutions.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Discoveries of a British Correspondent.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Discoveries of a British Correspondent.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a858992e-e97e-5be6-bf60-10f8b3409c66,759,nyt://article/a858992e-e97e-5be6-bf60-10f8b3409c66,

From this correspondence it is abundantly clear that Mr. LINCOLN and his colleagues, in issuing the notifications of blockade of the 19th and 27th of April, and in furnishing instructions to the commanders of the blockading squadron, are under the impression that they have done all that is required by the law of nations, and that all violators of the blockade after this warning, must take the consequence of their own acts. The resources of the Federal Government would seem to be sufficient to institute an efficient blockade of most of the Southern ports, and we shall probably soon hear that the blockade is complete. By the last advices, we learn that, on the 14th of the present month, gunboats were stationed off the months of the James, Elizabeth, and York Rivers; off Fort Monroe; and at the opening of Chesapeake Bay; while it is stated that the ports of Florida have been under blockade since the 6th inst. The cruisers of the Federal Government have been at active as need be. Several seizures have been already made and reported. On the 14th, the Argo was captured in Chesapeake Bay, coming from Richmond with a cargo of tobacco, valued at $150,000. This prize fell to the lot of the gunboat Quaker City. The Crusader has seized the Wanderer off Key West, and the United States ship Yankee is reported as having been off Cape Hetlopen with no less than three steamers in charge. These prizes are all, it is believed, American vessels, and we do not find that there is any disposition to molest the neutral flag anywhere, or on any pretence. It is to be observed, moreover, that all the seizures so far have been made by the cruisers of the Federal Government. The authority conveyed in President DAVIS' proclamation, and confirmed by the Southern Congress to it out vessels under letters-of-marque and reprisal, does not seem, so far, at least, to have enabled those who have obtained such letters to protect the shipping of the South, much less to encounter anywhere the blockading squadron. This is the more strange, seeing that applications are said to have been made for letters-of-marque from the shipowners of New-England, the whalers of New-Bedford, and elsewhere in the Northern State -- persons, we should say, who would be able to fit out a most effective and formidable fleet of privateers.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'COMMENTS OF THE PRESS ON THE CORRESPONDENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'COMMENTS OF THE PRESS ON THE CORRESPONDENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Mercantile Gazette', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af4eab4f-c39d-5c66-b118-c5f7ad14c31e,1693,nyt://article/af4eab4f-c39d-5c66-b118-c5f7ad14c31e,

The men are willing to go. They are ready and anxious to take part in the stirring events which seem so near at band. The Government wants them, is ready to receive and place them on active duty. The difficulty appears to be with the commanders of these organizations, who are unwilling to forego the prospects of service when their commands shall, as they hope perhaps they soon will be, full. We do not intend to be understood as censuring them in the slightest degree. We appreciate their honorable ambition, but we suggest whether, in the present crisis, patriotism and the public good do not require that some of them shall stand aside, and permit these imperfect regiments to be consolidated. The companies formed under different field-officers might be brought together, making as many regiments as the enlistments already made would fill, and could thus be enabled to go forward to take part in the battles which in all probability are soon to be fought.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/14/archives/english-misrepresentations-of-america.html,,"One nation often serves as a mirror which reflects to another dispositions which, from prudential motives have long been suppressed or concealed. It is not pleasant to tell Mr. So-and-so, to his face, our opinion of him, especially so long as he is our equal in position and power. But when we believe him to have fallen, we are outspoken in proportion to our supposed immunity. In this way, the crisis in America has unmasked England as nothing else could. Her ruling classes believed that the final dissolution of the great Republic was accomplished. The eagerness with which this was proclaimed showed the wish to be father to the belief. Our institutions were denounced -- ""the best of them,"" says the London Times, ""having gone all wrong for a long time past:"" the character of our people was caricatured and vilified; and the contest in which we are engaged stigmatized as an unprincipled struggle for territorial aggrandizement. Not the slightest sympathy was expressed for us in our great strait, when it seemed for a moment that we might go down; nor for the cause for which we were fighting -- the rights of humanity and a Constitutional Government. England stood by, not an indifferent spectator, but eager to witness a final dissolution that would rid her of a hated commercial rival, and stamp as utterly impracticable those institutions which for a long time have threatened to subvert her own. Thank Heaven, our Government is not dead, or dissolved. What was to have been the fatal blow has only given to it new life and power. What was valuable in its institutions is to exert a tenfold greater influence than ever. A giant stands for the fallen victim, confronting his libeler face to face. Whatever may be the result, the entente cordiale is completely severed, not to be restored, till a new sentiment and a new Government in England shall supplant the old. The lowest of all qualities has that country displayed -- jealousy of a child, whom she would crush rather than suffer to exist as a rival. Henceforth the two countries will stand as antagonists in ideas and in aims. The peace between them will be that of an armed neutrality. Her historical relation toward us has been that of an arrogant superior. We have long tried to outgrow the sense of the insults and injuries we have received, and had hoped we had succeeded, but the last is the unkindest cut of all. It dispels our illusions of the possibility of a hearty friendship with her, and shows that we must look elsewhere for friends in fighting the battle of humanity.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'English Misrepresentations of America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'English Misrepresentations of America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5f74eade-655a-5950-95a5-48c03993cca0,1553,nyt://article/5f74eade-655a-5950-95a5-48c03993cca0,

"In my last letter I gave an account of such matters as passed under my notice on my way to this city, which I reached, as you are aware, on the night of Saturday, May 4. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/14/archives/montgomery-and-the-government-letter-from-mr-russell.html,,"In my last letter I gave an account of such matters as passed under my notice on my way to this city, which I reached, as you are aware, on the night of Saturday, May 4. I am on difficult ground, the land is on fire, the earth is shaking with the tramp of armed men, and the very air is hot with passion. Mty communications are cut off, or are at best accidental, and in order to reopen them I must get further away from them, paradoxical as the statement may appear to be. It is impossible to know what is going on at the North, and almost the same to learn what is doing in the South out of eyeshot; it is useless to inquire what news is sent to you to England. The telegraphic communications are now broken, so are all the mall routes. Newspapers and letters now and then reach well-known people here from New-York in six or seven days. Events hurry on with tremendous rapidity, and even the lightning lags behind them. The people of the South at last are aware that the ""Yankees"" are preparing to support the Government of the United States, and that the secession can only be maintained by victory in the field. There has been a change in their war policy. They now aver that 'they only want to be left alone,' and they declare they do not intend to take Washington, and that it was merely as a feint they spoke about it. The fact is, there are even in the compact and United South men of moderate and men of extreme views, and the general tone of the whole is regulated by the preponderance of the one or the other at the moment. I have no doubt on my mind that the Government here intended to attack and occupy Washington -- not the least that they had it much at heart to reduce Fort Pickets as soon as possible. Now some of their fritnos say that it will be a mere matter of convenience whether they attack Washington or not, and that as for Fort Pickens, they will certainly let it alone, at all events, for the present, inasmuch as the menacing attitude of Gen. BRAGG obliges the enemy to keep a squadron of their best ships there, and to retain a force of regulars they can ill spare in a position, where they must to in lose enormously from diseases incidental to the climate. They have discovered, too, that the position is of little value so long as the United States hold Tortugas and Key West. Out the Conferences are preparing for the conflict, and when they have organized their forces, they will make, I am satisfied, a very resolute advance all along the line. They are, at present, strong enough, they suppose, in their domestic resources, and in the difficulties presented to the advance of a hostile force by the nature of the country, to bill defiance to invasion, or, at all events, to inflict a very severe chastisement on the invaders, and their excited manner of speech so acts upon their minds that they begin to think that they can defy, not merely the United States, but the world. Thus it is that they declare they never can be conquered, that they will die to a man, woman and chilo first; and that if fifty thousand, or any number of thousands, of Black Republicans get one hundred miles into Virginia, not one of them shall ever get out alive. Behind all this talk, however, there is immense energy, great resolution, and fixed principles of action. Their strategy consists in keeping quiet till they have their troops well in hand, in such numbers and discipline as shall give them fair grounds for expecting success in any campaign with the United States troops. They are preparing with vigor to render the descent of the Mississippi imposible, by erecting batteries on the commanding levees or embankments which hem in its waters for upwards of eight hundred miles of bank, and they are occupying, as far as they can, all the strategical points of attack, or defence within their borders. When everything is ready, it is not improbable that Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS will take the command of the army, for he is reported to have a high ambition to acquire reputation as a General, and in virtue of his office he is Generalissimo of the armies of the Confederate States. It will be remarked that this plan tress upon the assumption that the United States cannot or will not wage an offensive war, or obtain any success in their attempts to recover the forts and other property of the Federal Government. They firmly believe the war will not last a year, and that 1862 will behold a victorious, compact slaveholding confederate Power of fifteen States, under a strong Government, prepared to hold its own against the world, or that portion of it which may attack it. I now but repeat the sentiments and expectations of those around me. They believe in the irresistible power of cotton in the natural alliance between manufacturing England and France and the cotton producing Slave States, in the force of their simple tariff, and in the interests which arise out of a system of free trade, which, however, by a rigorous legislation they will interdict to their neighbors in the Free States, and only open for the benefit of their foreign customers. Commercially, and politically, and militarily, they have made up their minds, and never was there such confidence exhibited by any people in the future as they have, or pretend to have, in their destiny.

Eight car loads of provisions, it is stated, were destroyed, to prevent their falling into the hands of the Federal troops -- there being no facilities for getting them away. Notwithstanding the preparations which have been made for this movement of the rebels, it is evident that it was made in hurry and confusion -- caused, probably, by reports that the Federal troops were rapidly approaching from Greencastle and Cumberland. If it is true, as reported, that the retreat of the rebels is in the direction of Winchester, the ultimate destination is, no doubt, Manassas Junction, by way of Strasburg and Front Royal, taking care to destroy the bridges over the Shenandoah at the latter point. Whether their progress to the Junction will be interfered with by the Federal column supposed to be operating in the vicinity of Leesbugh, remains to be seen.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7d07243f-80ff-5e71-97bf-66a1b2f70869,1359,nyt://article/7d07243f-80ff-5e71-97bf-66a1b2f70869,

"Workmen have been employed for some time, excavating a portion of Smith's Island, for the purpose of providing accommodations for loading coal vessels at the island.

The coffins were in an excellent state of preservation, and the skeletons within them were perfect, with the exception of two of them being without the skulls. The other skull was of remarkable size and formation. The supposition that these were the remains of pirates, arises from the fact that an execution took place, in 1800, upon the island, (then known as Windmill Island,) of three individuals, for piracy on board the schooner Eliza, Capt. WHEELAND. Their names were JOSEPH BROUS, alias La Roche; PETER PETERSON, alias La Croix; and JOSEPH BAKER, alias Boulenger.

Well-known traitors are permitted to remain in Washington; they are even retained in confidential positions under Government, and even when insurgents are captured with arms in their hands, they are allowed to return to their treason, with no other warrant for their behavior, than the farcical repetition of an oath, which the very first condition of the secession movement pronounces to be of no obligation. It is indeed difficult to discover a distinct indication that the Administration of Mr. LINCOLN regards treason with any stronger sentiment of reprobation than did that of Mr. BUCHANAN. So powerful is this feeling of popular discontent and anger at the apparent sympathy of the Government with those in revolt, that we understand the leading merchants and citizens of New-York, whose labors and money have given the Administration what strength it has to make war upon the insurrection, are contemplating an organized demonstration, which shall either compel the Government to reflect more truthfully the will of the people, or shall constitute the basis of a vigorous opposition, looking to a reconstruction of the Cabinet.

JACKSON, Governor of Missouri, whose devious course for many weeks back in reference to the present rebellion and war, and whose hostility to the Government, at last avowed, have given his name prominence before the country, is, we believe, a native of Missouri. He was long a resident of Howard County, a stronghold of the Pro-Slavery Democracy. A few years since he removed his residence to Saline County, which is his home at the present time. He is about fifty years of age, courteous and pleasing in manners. Though possessing only mediocre talents, he has, by the low cunning of a scheming politician and a fortunate accident, arisen in political life. Some twelve years since, Judge NAPTON, a leading Soft (Anti-Benton) Democrat, prepared a series of resolutions, to be introduced in the Legislature, the import of which was, that the State of Missouri would abide by whatever decision the Southern States should come to in defence of their institutions. To this was added another resolution, instructing their Senators and Representatives in Congress to assume this position for Missouri in their public acts and votes. JACKSON, who was then a member of the Legislature, was used by NAPTON as a catspaw, to introduce the resolutions before that body. After some resistance, they were passed but Col. BENTON repudiated them, as an effort on the part of the Legislature to pledge the State for nullification. Hence arose the hue and cry of the nullifying Democrats against Col. BENTON, which resulted in the formation of a strong Anti-Benton party, and his defeat when a candidate for reelection, for the United States Senate. Pending this canvas, Col. BENTON, in his public speeches, took frequent occasion to denounce JACKSON, and by doing so gave him an importance which he little deserved. Hearing that JACKSON had threatened to shoot him if he attempted to speak in Howard County, BENTON proceeded thither at his earliest opportunity, and made a public speech filled with scathing sarcasm directed at JACKSON and his fellow-nullifiers, and mentioning them by name. Though JACKSON was present and made some interruptions, no violence was offered.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Profile of a Belated Traitor.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Profile of a Belated Traitor.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e273d1c3-e791-5ef9-9003-03ed1eb68778,586,nyt://article/e273d1c3-e791-5ef9-9003-03ed1eb68778,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/16/archives/songs-for-the-south.html,,"""Dixie's Land"" has been the inspiring melody which the Southern people, by general consent, have adopted as their ""national air"" -- a sort of cotton ""Yankee Doodle."" Like most articles of Southern consumption, the melody was imported from the North, -- Northern men being guilty of perpetrating both words and music. Still, as a ""national air,"" the Mobile Mercury objects to it. Considering that the Southern ""nation"" is a negro slave aristocracy, it seems paradoxical that the editor of that journal should insist that it is ""absurd to imagine that Dixie, a dancing, capering, rowdyish, bacchanalian negro air, will ever be the music of such words as a nation of free men can sing with any respect for themselves."" Hence, believing that national songs are never ground out to order, the Mercury is hoping that some, as yet undiscoverd, Carey, Rouget del'Isle, or Key will turn up who can reduce rebellion, repudiation, and robbery to hexameters. As the Muses have never sufficiently appreciated the attractions of Southern scenery, to recline their forms for any length of time under the shade of ""persimmon trees,"" or to stretch their classic lengths, except for brief periods, upon the ""sandy bottoms,"" the time is very uncertain when, to quote the choice language of the Mercury, ""a national anthem will be born into original poetic and musical life,"" with ""words simple and thrilling, and the music bold, swelling, speaking, majestic."" Still, as the want exists, we would humbly suggest how it can be temporarily met. Let Mr. GILMORE SIMMS and Mr. PAUL HAYNE, whose genius the clouds of war have temporarily obscured, emerge from their seclusion, put their shoulder to the poetic wheel and compose some appropriate verses in which patriotism and piracy, chivalry and shin-plasters, and ""neutrality"" and niggers, may be appropriately blended in verse to be set to the ""Rogue's March."" We would also suggest that the words be dedicated to His Excellency, Hon. JEFF. DAVIS, President C.S.A., and the members of his Cabinet. Such a poetical effort will answer the requirement temporarily; and, as the ""Southern Nation""seems likely to suffer a total eclipse at no very distant day, it matters not if the inspired genius, whose advent the Mercury so fondly awaits, should not attempt to perpetuate, as well as inaugurate, the worship of the Muses on Southern soil.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SONGS FOR THE SOUTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SONGS FOR THE SOUTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/efeac7d8-2f93-5479-9cbf-48af3ca2b3f5,387,nyt://article/efeac7d8-2f93-5479-9cbf-48af3ca2b3f5,

On the 2d inst. information was brought in by the Animos Express rider that KIT's horse had fallen, and rolled down hill with him, injuring him so seriously that he had to return to Taos. This was a damper. Many had placed their last hope, on him, and now gave up. KIT's party, now under the command of Capt.

It appears that late on Friday night the complainant was in a disreputable lager-beer cellar, kept by Emily Marsh, at No. 265 William-street, and after imbibing sundry drinks and partaking of other refreshments, was presented with a bill of $4, by his hostess. This amount he considered exorbitant, and refused to pay, when the woman called up the two police officers, who were present at the time, and introduced them as such to Baaden. They then showed their shields, and deliberately took from him his watch, money, &c., he making no forcible resistance. The following morning the matter was made known at the head-quarters of the Police Department, and the arrest of the officers was ordered. On searching the house of Foster, No. 648 Fourth-street, the complainant's watch was found, but the chain, locket and money have not been recovered. The officer says he found the watch upon the sidewalk, and took it home for safe keeping, and subsequently told one of the Sergeants that he had it, and wished to find its owner.

"Yesterday was a busy day at the encampment at East New-York, in consequence of orders having been received for the regiment to march forward to Washington to-day. The cheerful countenances of the men, and their active movements, evinced the gratification produced at the prospect of soon meeting with the enemies of the country, and at the same time exhibiting their loyalty and patriotism. Since being quartered at East New-York they have been sadly neglected by the Union Defence Committee, many of them being for a long time unprovided with shoes, and a far greater number destitute of absolutely essential articles of clothing. The officers of the regiment have expended from their own private purses no less a sum than $5,000, and justly claim this amount at the hands of the Committee. It was only a few days ago that they commenced receiving their tents, the last of which did not arrive on the ground till Saturday of the preceding week. They are now in possession of one hundred small tents and fifteen large ones. All the equipments arrived yesterday, and if the arms are received this morning, as it was expected they would be, nothing will prevent them from leaving to-day. Six P.M. is the hour appointed for departure, and each man is to be supplied with ten days' rations, which will enable them to proceed beyond Washington without any unnecessary delay at that point. The whole force consists of about 800 men, all of whom are well and hearty, with the exception of Lieut. ROBERTS, of Company B, who is suffering from ill health, occasioned by exposure during the Mexican campaigns, and who, on this account will probably be furloughed for a few weeks.

"Andres Cassard vs. The Manhattan Gas Light Company. -- In January, 1858, the plaintiff purchased the interest in the cigar-store No. 592 Broadway, which at the time was lighted by the defendants. In February following, the plaintiff, as he avers, paid the gas bill presented, and asked the collector if it was necessary to give any other name than that of the party of whom he purchased, and whose name the company had. He also avers that the collector said ""No; as long as the bills are paid it is all right."" Subsequent bills were made out against the premises in the name of the former proprietor, and as alleged by plaintiff, paid by him. On the 1st of May following, plaintiff was however requested to make the usual application to be supplied with gas, and to make a deposit to secure the payment therefor. The plaintiff protested, but the Company threatened that he must either do so or have the supply of gas cut off. Plaintiff made application to have his name substituted in place of the former proprietor, but the Company refused, and sent a messenger to take away the meter.

In February following, the plaintiff, as he avers, paid the gas bill presented, and asked the collector if it was necessary to give any other name than that of the party of whom he purchased, and whose name the company had. He also avers that the collector said ""No; as long as the bills are paid it is all right."" Subsequent bills were made out against the premises in the name of the former proprietor, and as alleged by plaintiff, paid by him. On the 1st of May following, plaintiff was however requested to make the usual application to be supplied with gas, and to make a deposit to secure the payment therefor. The plaintiff protested, but the Company threatened that he must either do so or have the supply of gas cut off. Plaintiff made application to have his name substituted in place of the former proprietor, but the Company refused, and sent a messenger to take away the meter. Plaintiff then made application for an injunction to restrain the Company from taking away the meter and cutting off the gas.

A prompt compliance is urged, ""without a day to be lost,"" on account of the rapid approach of Federal troops from Ohio upon the ""sacred soil"" of Virginia. Now this appears from a Confederate stand-point, and would read in their history, as an appeal worthy the head and heart of a patriotic Virginian. But its patriotism is only apparent. It is, in fact, like this veteran pilferer's official orders to our Northern arsenals, one of the Governor's cunningly devised meal-tubs, with the tail of the cat sticking out. Gov. FLOYD, while Secretary of War, transferred from Northern to Southern arsenals more United States arms than would equip four times the number of troops the rebels have or can maintain in the field. Why then, this call for the surrender of every old fowling-piece, King's-arm, sabre, or what-not, that may have been rusting for generations in the cabins and garrets of the mountains and valleys of Virginia, or why transfer these weapons from the hands of the present possessors to others no better able to use them. It requires but a glance at the relative position of the parties, to detect the false pretensions of the appeal, and but a word to show its two faces. It is a trap to disarm the simple-hearted and faithful mountaineers of Virginia, in anticipation of the Western army of occupation, and deprive this loyal Union population of the means of cooperating with the Federal army in putting down the rebellion. Though couched in the language of appeal, it will be enforced with all the severity of a military order, and any attempt at evasion or non-compliance in the surrender will be set to the account of abolition sentiments or submissionism, and draw down upon the defenceless citizen the cruelties and barbarisms which we know too well are the measures of ""coercion"" employed by these mad Secessionists even upon our own loyal people. The collections thus forced from these Union Districts are to be published abroad as the voluntary response of the people to FLOYD's appeal, and an evidence of the universal prevalence among them of secession sentiments. The very desperation of the secession cause is the secret of their acknowledged executive ability in employing the right men in the right places for the accomplishment of their designs. And in no case have they followed their instinct more correctly than in the use they are making of FLOYD. He is accomplished in his specialty, and can practice it without scruple as well at home as abroad. He is the Artful Dodger of the Southern Confederacy, and when he fails, it will be when the honest laws of meum and teum are again righteously enforced in the Old Dominion.

A retreat saved the remainder of the little army from destruction. This is a lamentable tale to tell, and to hear. To know that the sturdy masses of men, who are daily thronging through our City streets on their way to the theatre of war, are to be exposed to something much beyond the necessary hazards of war; that they are to be the corpora vilia upon which the experiments of incompetent commanders are to found a future capacity for military leadership is a reflection which does not greatly strengthen confidence in eventual success. It is true we gain daily the prestige furnished by a retreating enemy; and we have the best evidence that the foe shrinks from a fair encounter upon equal conditions, sheltering himself in triply-armed intrenchments, and otherwise manifesting his aversion to hand-in-hand encounters.

It is said that many business firms in Philadelphia suffered by his rascality, one establishment alone -- that of Messrs. LENNON & GILLENDER losing $8,000 by believing his misrepresentations. Before measures were taken to arrest him he came to this City, and on Monday evening he was encountered in the Bowery by Detectives SLOWEY and DUSENBERRY. They knew him immediately from the description that had been left at the office, and DUSENBERRY, stopping up, said ""How d'ye do, Mr. JACKSON."" The latter replied, ""Quite well, but really he had not the pleasure, &c.,"" when SLOWEY interposed with a question as to what time he intended to call for those other coffins. Light at once flashed upon JACKSON's mind. He know he was caught and he made the best of it, making a full acknowledgment of his guilt when interrogated with reference to his many swindling transactions. He was confined at Head-quarters, and yesterday afternoon departed for Philadelphia, consenting to waive the formality of a requisition from the Governor of Pennsylvania.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7c73c522-70e9-53fc-ae57-4db001211862,1254,nyt://article/7c73c522-70e9-53fc-ae57-4db001211862,

All but four companies had thus been dropped, when, on approaching Vienna, a masked battery stationed at a curve in the road, which at that point passed through a deep cut, opened upon the train, with round shot, shell and grape, causing the death of a number of our troops, and wounding many others, before the train could be stopped. Some of the running gear of the train was damaged by the fire, so that the engine, which was in the rear, could not draw it back out of range, and the men were consequently forced to leave the cars and retire on foot, which they did in good order, taking their killed and wounded. Finding that the rebel battery was supported by a regiment of infantry and a body of cavalry, Gen. SCHENCK, who commanded the expedition, thought it prudent to retire, which he did, without further molestation from the enemy, who are understood to have been South Carolinians.

The programme was long, but well selected, and with few exceptions the boys demonstrated that they had profited by the teaching of Prof. BROWN, their instructor in elocution Music by Dodworth's Band agreeably relieved the speaking. The exercises were concluded by a distribution of prizes for exemplary conduct and proficiency.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/22/archives/the-manufacture-of-light-cannon.html,,"Thus far artillery has done the business of this war; and all modern history renders it probable that artillery will finish it, when the bayonet cannot be used. A first-class battle would be but half-an-hour's job, if the rifled cannon could be substituted for the rifled musket. While the latter, in default of the long practice and extraordinary coolness on the part of the soldier that alone insures good aim, throws away at least nine hundred and ninety-nine bullets, while the lucky one in a thousand bores but one small hole, the former, having a fixed support, and hence an accurate aim, drives its percussion shell fall of bullets, two or three miles away, and then whirls its hundred missiles of death in every direction. Of course, the weight of the cannon, and, to some degree, its expense, prevent its exclusive or very extensive use in the field; but, within certain limits, the more these can be reduced, the greater will be the number that can be practically used. To this end the energies of governments and inventors have been devoted for years. How to make cannon within reasonable limits of cost, out of the strongest material, and hence, the highest material, for a given strength, so that they can be easily transported, is one of the great problems of the day. Thus far the practice shows that there is one condition of cannon-metal, so extremely important, that many other features of great value can well be dispensed with to secure it, and that condition is harm-geneousness. Tenacity is very important, and se is hardness, but these are both sacrificed in the cast iron and the bronze gun, to secure that homogeneousness in the metal which it has been impossible to give to large masses of wrought iron and steel -- materials otherwise superior because stronger and harder. The greater the tenacity of the material the less thickness is required to sustain the force of the explosion; and the greater its hardness the loss the wear of the grooves by the projectile. But strength in one part and weakness in another is a defect, the risk of which, even, cannot be tolerated; and this is just the defect of wrought metals -- that although stronger than cast metals when sound, the welding of several parts into one is likely to leave seams which the explosive force of powder will soon open. Wrought iron and puddled steel are made from east iron in a puddling furnace; the cast iron is softened and decarbonized by a great heat, and worked by the operative into balls, which are hammered into blooms, and these blooms are made into slabs, or bars, and these are laid in piles, and welded together into cannon. Hence, there must be a number of welds in any large mass this made, for it is impossible, in the present state of the art, to work up a puddle-bail large enough to make a cannon without a weld, or to get the cinder out of such a puddle-bail, if it could be made. The trouble with welding is, that the oxidation of the surfaces, and the cinder squeezed by the process out of the iron or steel, prevent the absolute union of the parts. But it is probable that improved machinery, especially heavier hammers, wild seen remedy this defect. Blacksmiths find very little difficulty in wedding small pieces of from and puddled steel soundly, simply because they use hammers that are very heavy in proportion to the work, and so condense the parts to the very core at each blow. And there is no doubt that proportionately heavy hammers would make cannon nearly as sound. While in welding small parts, we strike there with a blow equal to that of a hammer of fifty times their weight, we have been attempting to weld masses weighing live or six tons with hammers of three or four tons weight. It is well known among iron-workers, that light hammering on a large mass of iron, instead of condensing the metal, will absolutely separate it in the centre. Steamboat shafts, made under light hammers, have been found absolutely hollow in the centre, from end to end, by reason of the stretching of the outer stratum of metal. But if a pile of bars or slabs, from which a cannon is to be forged, were struck at a welding heat three or four blows from a twenty-ton hammer -blows that would jam every particle in the mass, from circumference to centre, into intimate union, and squeeze the cinder out under this enormous pressure -- we believe there would be very little trouble with bad welds. But we might as reasonably hope to weld log-chains, with carpet-hammers, as to make sound work of large cannon with the light machinery generally in use. We are glad to learn that some of our iron-makers are aware of the serious defects in the processes now adopted. A reform will be of great advantage to the army and the public.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Manufacture of Light Cannon', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Manufacture of Light Cannon', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b97afe2-7af3-54ef-b36a-3c5edebcdf41,1255,nyt://article/4b97afe2-7af3-54ef-b36a-3c5edebcdf41,

They do not, it is true, fully realize our idea of the functions and attributes of government, and the constitutional necessity of preserving our national integrity does not impress them as we might desire. This is due to two causes; first, to the tone assumed by the English Press, the influence of which cannot but react on public opinion in France and, second, to the defective sources from which they derive their information. In several instances we have detected in French papers erroneous statements concerning American affairs, which evidently do not originate with the American Press, but must rather be attributed to the inventive genius of some foreign journals in the secession interest printed in our City. Thus M. GAILLARDET, the American editor of the Presse, writes nearly two columns on the acceptance of the Canadian regiment by Mr. LINCOLN, and on his order raising the blockade of Charleston -- two canards of the hugest magnitude. He speaks of the inactivity of the Federal army, as if our Army, which was not in existence two months ago, had not done wonders in so short a time, and seems surprised that Mr. LINCOLN does not prosecute the war in the interests of emancipation. These follies, delivered in sounding sentences, are crowned by the opinion that the threats made by Mr. SEWARD to Spain about her occupation of San Domingo, indicate a design on the part of the Administration to close the civil war by offering to the South the Island of Caba as a bonne bouche.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tone of the French Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Tone of the French Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b6471ea5-2401-51ce-be76-9bcff5627f6d,699,nyt://article/b6471ea5-2401-51ce-be76-9bcff5627f6d,

As the case stands at present, the sovereignty of the State rests in the late State Convention, which will probably assemble within a week, to resolve on some definite policy. The course which duty suggests is plain enough. The whole present State Government must be declared out of power, and an election for a new Legislature and new State officials ordered, pending the result of which, the State Convention should form itself into a Provisional Government. Whether such a course of action will be adopted, is, however, very questionable. Although the Union sentiment was vastly preponderate in the Convention at its late session, yet a great portion of this loyalty was of that very suspicious kind, which is willing to compromise with traitors, and knows no higher standard of constitutional obligations than the deceptive phrase, ""armed neutrality."" Others have grown lukewarm and reckless in view of the neglect they have been treated with by the Federal Government. It is not therefore improbable that the State Conventi on will hesitate at energetic measures, although circumstances demand them imperiously, and that it will seek to patch up some new sort of a compromise between the outraged people of Missouri and its runway officials. Party considerations will plead strongly against a new election, and party considerations are by no means so weightless as one could wish, where a nation is engaged in a struggle for its very existence. But what is to be done if the State Convention refuse to do its manifest duty? If the General Government is at all equal to the emergency, Gen. LYON will be ordered to disband the State Condition at the first attempt to compromise with treason, -- for, it is to be hoped, that the General Government will by this time have awakened to the fact that Gov. JACKSON, with his whole clique of military and legislative adherents, are traitors, and immediately order a new election for delegates to a new Convention, fresh from the people. Of course party hacks and quibbling politicians would call this a high-handed proceeding, and rave and write stupid and voluminous treatises on the legality of the thing; but it ought to be about time to stop listening to these disquisitions on civil law. Violent diseases require violent remedies. Mobs and rebellions must be treated with doses of grape-shot and Minie-rifle balls. Gov. JACKSON has not only declared war against the Government of the United States, but he is also in open rebellion against the State of Missouri. He has stolen her archives and State papers, plundered her treasury, hired incendiaries to burn the bridges of her railroads, and is now -- a fugitive from justice -- attempting to accomplish her complete ruin by forcing her into a Confederacy she hates and despises. He and the whole gang of his accomplices are outlaws; to acknowledge them at still representing the State of Missouri is treason against the State as well as against the Union. Missouri is, until the State Convention assembles, without a Government; she it, in point of fact, under military law, established for her benefit by the Government of the United States. The loyal men, the large majority of her citizens, are thankful to the General Government for this long-expected interference, and only pray that it will not again result in a compromise with her bitterest foe, the now Ex-Gov. JACKSON, by which the conflict would only be once more postponed.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NOTES OF THE REBELLION.; AFFAIRS IN MISSOURI. WHAT WILL THE STATE CONVENTION DO?

"It would probably be as well to cease at once ail attempts to enlighten our ex-friends of the fast-anchored Isle in regard to American affairs. If they cannot be induced to furnish themselves with a copy of that ""three-cent"" Constitution of ours, or to learn the outlines of our geography, or to find out what color we are, or what are our social conditions, it can be of but little use to discuss with them the Constitutional right of secession, or the doctrine of concurrent majorities, or the question of extending Slavery into the Territories of Nebraska or Nevada. The leading paper of Scotland, the Edinburgh Witness, has lately had a series of articles on the American troubles, in which a great deal of good feeling toward us is mingled with the most fantastical misconceptions of our character and affairs. It seems to regard the present rebellion as a war raging between what it oddly calls the ""American peasants"" of the West and North and the tyrants of somewhere else; and seems to be in considerable of a quandary, as well it might be, as to which of the parties will ultimately get whipped. In a late issue, however, the editor gives out that the thing might all be peacefully settled somehow or other; and as the General Assembly or supreme court of the Scottish Kirk is in session, he bethinks him that an anti-war remonstrance from a body of so much weight and piety would doubtless be heeded by the belligerent peasants and their foes. ""We have read with deep satisfaction,"" says the Witness, ""the remarks on this subject made by the Moderator of the General Assembly in his opening address. It may, we suppose, be now taken for granted that the propriety of a Christian remonstrance (with the Americans for going to war) from the highest court of our Church will at least be discussed; and if such a thing should be adopted, we may certainly anticipate"" -- well, perhaps, a cessation of hostilities. The whole thing is simple enough and can very easily be settled. The peasants, you see, are fighting for the freedom of the blackamoors, while the Southerners, according to Mr. RUSSELL, are anxious to have a king. Now, let the peasants choose two of their number, say CASSIUS M. CLAY and BEN. BUTLER, and let the other side select two of their representatives, say TOOMBS and BEAUREGARD. Let them conjointly hold a parliament somewhere in the State of Cairo, or in the flourishing burgh of South Carolina. Let the Southerners compromise by setting all their blackamoors free, and then let the peasants compromise by allowing a Southern king, say King JEFF, for instance, to rule over them. Then America, from Hudson's Bay to Jamaica, will enjoy quiet, and in due time may become a respectable appendage of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/23/archives/a-transatlantic-solution-of-the-american-problem.html,,"It would probably be as well to cease at once ail attempts to enlighten our ex-friends of the fast-anchored Isle in regard to American affairs.

Two days afterwards, President LINCOLN gave notice to the world that if any person, under the pretended authority of any such commission, or under any other pretence, should molest a vessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on board of her, such persons would be held, amenable to the laws of the United States, for the prevention and punishment of piracy. Matters were in this position when Judge BETES instructed the Grand Jury of this District that piracy consists in a forcible capture or robbery on the high seas of any vessel or her lading, by a vessel not authorized by a lawful commission from a Government organized and acting under the law of nations, and is punishable with death in the tribunals of all countries where the offence is triable.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/23/archives/the-great-exhibition-of-1862.html,,"However absorbing the arts of war may be at the present moment, it would be unjust to ourselves and to posterity, to neglect, or even modify our wonted enthusiasm in the great arts of peace; for by these arts, fostered under a free Government, have we attained that name and excellence among nations which we now fight to maintain. Recent history teaches that no means or influences so greatly stimulate improvement and success in what may be generally termed The Useful Arts -- in manufactures, Inventions, and processes, engineering, mechanical, chemical, agricultural -- in the utilization of natural materials and forces -- as that general distribution of special knowledge, and that healthy and noble emulation which are the fruit of public exhibitions of these results, by all the means new so commonly adopted, from the County fair at the County town, to the World's fair at the World's metropolis. No man can compute the solid gain which has accrued to the civilized, and, indeed, the uncivilized nations, from the development and results of that grand idea of SCOTT RUSSELL -- the Great Exhibition of 1851. No man can say, after a little reflection, that the Fairs of the American Institute and the Franklin Institute, and others among as commenced at a much earlier period, have not been worth millions to the people of this country. It must be so from the nature of things. Were men or communities isolated, no progress would be made; very little was made till means of communication became general, and as these means have increased, invention and discovery have kept pace with them. There is no doubt the steam engine would have been in use before the Christian era, if men of all nations or even the ingenious men and experimenters of one nation could have been brought into contact. We know that the power of steam was applied -- a steam engine invented -- centuries ago; but no one man could perfect it; and there is every reason to believe that the engines of SAVERY and NEWCOMEN would have been forgotten as the earlier, crude and impracticable devices were, had there been no rapid means of interchanging ideas, and the consequent handing down of the rough diamond from one generation of experimenters to another, till it is now, by the friction of many minds, the most glorious brilliant in the diadem of engineering achievement. Were a million of men to follow for a lifetime the same pursuit, each one being ignorant of the doings of the rest, there would be very little progress. So great art has been perfected till each one of generations of thinkers and workers have left their mark on it. And since it is impracticable for each representative man in a particular department to visit and compare notes with all the rest, great progress can only be made by centralizing -- condensing into limits which all men may compass, the best results and discoveries and aspirations of the whole world. The means of accomplishing such results, are scientific books and industrial exhibitions -- the former to cull the good things from the great mass of current practice, and to weigh, classify and preserve them and their principles -- the latter to stimulate a greater and better production.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Exhibition of 1862.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Exhibition of 1862.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a67eebf6-467d-5248-91d0-539ad8afc142,1001,nyt://article/a67eebf6-467d-5248-91d0-539ad8afc142,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/24/archives/northern-freedom-of-speech.html,,"Mr. GREGORY, the Irish advocate employed by the secession agents in London to put their case through Parliament, has to be consented with putting it through the columns of the Times. There is nothing in this effort -- which was heralded as an exhaustive demonstration of the propriety of recognizing the Southern Confederation -- which deserves the name of argument. It is a recital of the usual platitudes and sophisms of his clients, with some adroit appeals to that most accessible of an Englishman's sympathies, self-interest. But there is one point in which Mr. GREGORY is original, and deserves notice. He declares he is overwhelmed with letters from the Northern States, urging him in passionate terms, to press his advocacy to success, as the only means of defeating the National Government, and bringing the war to a close. And he argues that but for the terrorism which prevails in the North, these wishes would find open utterance, and from a mass of the population so numerous as to give them great political weight. We are quite prepared to believe that Mr. GREGORY is in receipt of the correspondence he describes. We have traitors of various kinds among us, and it is fair to assume the existence of a class willing to see England victorious over their country. But a vulgar mistake of the barrister throws much doubt upon the numerical strength he ascribes to this specific class. There is no terrorism in the Northern States. Men everywhere speak their opinions with entire freedom. Secession sentiments are uttered as loudly as any other; and there is hardly, perhaps, a community in the North without its swaggerer, to bluster on the side of treason and rebellion. In this City we have three daily journals of small importance, violently and abusively hostile to the Government and open in their sympathy with the South. There are one or two others, of large circulation, known to have the same decided proclivities; but who are compelled to a certain demonstrative loyalty, by the fear, not of violence, but of the entire demolition of their subscription lists. Terrorism, therefore, excercises no despotism over thought in the Free States. A safe measure of the justice of this assertion may be had by ascertaining whether one instance of compulsory return to the South can be found to balance the enforced flight for opinion's sake, of the ten thousand who have been driven hither by the rebels. Mr. GREGORY's statement about his American letters may go for what it is worth, but his inference is palpably worthless.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Northern Freedom of Speech.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Northern Freedom of Speech.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e281633-2a0c-58d6-acbc-541a2b8e21b0,427,nyt://article/3e281633-2a0c-58d6-acbc-541a2b8e21b0,

In a very little while the flames had communicated to other stables on the adjoining lots, Nos. 346, 350 and 352, owned and occupied by JOHN MCGRANE, and also to the five-story tenement house No. 347 West Thirty-seventh-street, causing damage to the extent of $300; covered by insurance. The property of the tenants was injured slightly by water. None were insured. A five story factory, owned by JAMES S. GAGE, in the rear of lots Nos. 251 and 253 West Thirty-seventh-street also caught fire, and was damaged about $200, the only reason why it was saved from destruction being the iron shutters with which it was provided. Another tenement house, No. 244 West Thirty-eighth-street, owned by JOHN MCGRANE, was likewise injured by the flames, although the loss is not extensive. The building was insured in the Bowery Insurance Company. The four-story frame tenement house No. 246 West Thirty-eighth-street was damaged to the extent of $1,200. Mr. MCGRANE owned it also, and had it insured in the North River Insurance Company. A shed in the rear of this building, containing 400 bales of hay, was destroyed, with its contents. Mr. MCGRANE estimates his entire loss at $3,000, upon which there was no insurance. A two-story frame building on the front of lot No. 248 West Thirty-eighth-street, owned by PATRICK CAVANNAGH, was damaged about $200; insured. Another frame building, No. 252, owned and occupied by THOS. BALLOU, was injured about $400 and the furniture $150; insured for $600 in the People's Insurance Company. A blacksmith's shop on lot No. 250, was also burned down. Between thirty and forty families have been rendered houseless by the fire, most of whom have loss a part of their furniture. None of them were insured. The fire was occasioned by children to the yard of No. 247 West Thirty-seventh-street, who set fire to some straw, and the flames spread to the staple.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/25ef6d7c-7e58-5fc6-a1c6-fd922b748046,690,nyt://article/25ef6d7c-7e58-5fc6-a1c6-fd922b748046,

The Academy is located at Sing Sing, and is under the management of Mr. PHELPS and Major W.W. BENJAMIN. Having reached the Chambers-street depot, the corps formed in line and marched down Broadway, headed by a band of thirteen pieces, to the Astor House, where a lunch had been provided for them. After disposing of the lunch the cadets again formed in line and proceeded down Broadway and Wall-street, and up Nassau-street to the City Hall Park, where they were reviewed by the Mayor, the Recorder, and members of the Common Council. The corps was divided into four companies, under the leadership of Maj. BENZAMIN, and was escorted by the Madison square Zouaves, the same company that met the Seventh Regiment on their return from Washington. They went through the various military movements in a manner that elicited frequent applause from the vast number of spectators that surrounded them, and several experienced officers were heard to say that their performance of the Zouave tactics was equal to that of any regiment that has left the City. Mayor WOOD addressed them in a few remarks in which he said he believed he expressed the opinion of the gentlemen present, when he said they had acquitted themselves with great credit to the institution of which they were members. He was gratified at the exhibition they had given, and would say, without casting any reflection upon others, but rather as a compliment, that they had acquitted themselves as well as any of the City regiments he had reviewed during these impending troubles. He said they appeared to be active, well disciplined, and to understand their duties thoroughly. It was gratifying to learn that their ranks contained representatives from almost all the States -- from the South as well as from the North -- and he hoped that their union and cooperation with each other would be followed by a reunion of the States. It was the duty of the cadets, the duty of us all, while we shall maintain the authority and the integrity of the Government, to be prepared, at the same time, to defend that authority. The Mayor hoped, if they ever were called upon to take the field, it would be to fight against a foreign enemy, and not against their fellow-countrymen. At the conclusion of the remarks, the corps visited the Governor's Room in the City Hall, after which they marched up Broadway and back again to the depot, where they took the cars at 6 o'clock for home. Tonight they have a ball, to be followed by a six week's vacation commencing on the following day.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mount Pleasant Academy Cadets.; REVIEW IN THE CITY HALL PARK.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mount Pleasant Academy Cadets.; REVIEW IN THE CITY HALL PARK.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b8223e33-f1ff-5870-a560-5357b39ca8c7,467,nyt://article/b8223e33-f1ff-5870-a560-5357b39ca8c7,

The presence of the loyal forces in Virginia have enabled the people of that State who preserved their allegiance, to maintain their position, and hold the Old Deminion to her place in the Union. When Gov. LETCHER and his associates went over to secession, it did not enter into their calculations that they would be superseded by a new dynasty, that would prevent them from striking from the national flag the star that Washington and his great compeers placed there. They did not take into the account that their own people, whom they were betraying, would, by an assertion of the original powers vested in them, repudiate their action, revoke their commissions, and strip them of official trust and authority.

The British manufacturers are now thoroughly alarmed in regard to the stability of their business, and are making strenuous efforts to provide against the certain diminution of their supply of American cotton. They are stimulating cotton production in every available region throughout the world. India has supplied them with nearly one-sixth of their cotton for several years past, and they hope to increase the amount very largely this year. But Indian cotton is generally so inferior to the American staple, that it cannot drive the Southern cotton out of the British market. African cotton, however, is of a much better quality, and is equal to the Southern for most manufacturing purposes. The attention of Great Britain is, therefore, turned to Africa as the region from whence the anticipated deficiency must be supplied. It is now definitely ascertained that the Continent of Africa is throughout a cotton-growing region, and all that is necessary to procure immense quantities of that staple is to promote civilization there, and bring the natives under sound influences, which, in elevating them, will supply them with the incentives to a vigorous development of the resources of their fertile territory.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE COTTON-FIELDS OF AFRICA.; Development of Cotton Culture Efforts of British Philanthropists The Yoruba Region Attention of New-Engand Manufacturers Pointed to Africa.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE COTTON-FIELDS OF AFRICA.; Development of Cotton Culture Efforts of British Philanthropists The Yoruba Region Attention of New-Engand Manufacturers Pointed to Africa.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'AFRICA', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cotton', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-06-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7e38721-2e68-5586-8b32-bc3b7522157b,1643,nyt://article/d7e38721-2e68-5586-8b32-bc3b7522157b,

At the time of the riots which disgraced Baltimore ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/28/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Gen. BANKS dealt a vigorous blow at the rebels in Baltimore, yesterday, by arresting Marshal KANE, Chief of the Police force in that city. At the time of the riots which disgraced Baltimore some weeks ago, proof was not wanting that Marshal KANE had availed himself of his position to incite the mob to acts of violence; and the only subject for wonder is that he has not before been consigned to Fort McHenry for safe keeping. That the people might not fear their rights were to be trespassed upon, Gen. BANKS issued a proclamation, giving his reasons for the arrest of the Marshal. He charges him explicitly with aiding and abetting the traitors who are in arms against the Government, both by direction and indirection. Under these circumstances he says that he cannot be regarded otherwise than as the head of an armed force hostile to its authority. For these reasons he has declared him under arrest, and in accordance with his instructions, Gen. BANKS has appointed Col. KENLY, of the First Maryland Regiment of Volunteers, Provost Marshal for Baltimore, to see that the police laws are effectually executed. This he is to do with the aid of the subordinate police officers, and without that of the Police Commissioners, who are probably regarded as infected with the same madness which has seized Marshal KANE. Very naturally, this action created much excitement in the city. The Union men were as gratified as the Secessionists were indignant. The Police Commissioners gave notice that they should enter a formal protest against Gen. BANKS' action, and then issued orders disbanding the entire force under their control, thus giving sufficient proof that the suspicions of their loyalty were well founded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/402251c2-e74b-5d2c-8b24-af860e83266b,1735,nyt://article/402251c2-e74b-5d2c-8b24-af860e83266b,

He further declared in his message that it was proposed ""to organize and hold in readiness for instant action an army of one hundred thousand men."" It is also well known that the Confederate Congress gave unhesitating sanction to all the measures proposed by DAVIS; and we may rest assured that the mad military spirit of the South has outrun even the precipitancy of the leaders, and that more men have been offered than the Confederate authorities could provide for. All testimony concurs in the statement, that ever since the secession of Virginia, under the tempting promise of an early sacking of Washington, a universal movement of armed men from all the States of the South has been in progress towards Virginia.

Winans et al vs. The Williamsburgh Ferry Company et al. -- The plaintiffs sue as assignees of Oliver Charlick, for an accounting by the Williamsburgh Ferry Company and other defendants, for the income and profits of the Grandstreet and Peck-slip Ferries to Williamsburgh. The Williamsburgh Ferry Company -- Wm. Wall and R.M. Demill -- are the only defendants who litigated, and they allege that Charlick's interest in the lease, which is the foundation of the action, was only nominal. They deny that Charlick or those claiming now as plaintiffs -- his assignees -- ever paid any portion of the rent or contributed any capital. It is alleged that a stock company used the franchise, and that the profits had been divided among the various stockholders without notice of any claim by the plaintiffs. The lease was dated Sept. 12, 1848, and was soon after authorized, but, as alleged, before it was delivered. Charlick became hostile to his associates, and directed the Corporation not to deliver it to them. He had received $2,000 from his associates as a consideration for his aid, and in October, 1848, he received from Withers and others $5,000 for his opposition. From the time of the assignment by Charlick to Withers and others, these assignees and Charlick did all in their power to destroy the lease. There was no evidence of the value of the one-fifth or of the whole of the lease. The facts found by the Referee are unimportant. The conclusions of law are that the plaintiffs cannot recover. The ground was, that the paper between the Corporation and Charlick was, though in the form of a lease, yet a contract, in which there were provisions founded on personal reliance on the grantees or lessees.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Williamsburgh Ferry Controversy.; SUPREME COURT GENERAL TERM.

They show the folly of attempting to win the Secessionists back to their allegiance by forbearance, and that the leniency of the Government, so far from being appreciated, is taken advantage of by them to perfect their conspiracies and mature their plans of revolt. The arrest of the head of the Police Department, with a commission as Brigadier-General of the rebel army in his pocket, is suggestive of a wide range of inquiry. Who are his subordinate officers, and where the men who are to fill his brigade? The resignation of nearly four hundred of the police force under his control throws some light on the subject, but they would make but a small portion of the four or five thousand necessary to compose his command. The proceedings of the Commissioners, censuring and protesting against the course of Gen. BANKS, and the tone of the resolutions passed by them, prove that they are not imbued with that spirit of loyalty which it would be pleasant to find prevalent in such a body. It is said that information is in possession of the loyal authorities, that many thousand stand of arms are concealed in the city and vicinity. From those facts, the conclusion is irresistible that a formidable conspiracy against the Government has been organized in Baltimore, and that its ramifications reach to an alarming and dangerous extent.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Position of Baltimore', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Position of Baltimore', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23b1a97a-5468-5752-a550-4266c2009562,610,nyt://article/23b1a97a-5468-5752-a550-4266c2009562,

SCOTT's plan for crushing out the great rebellion. I must confess that it strikes me as trifling with the serious business of restoring peace to the country. Instead of settling our difficulties by the sword, Gen. SCOTT proposes to do it by entirely sacrificing the commercial interests of the country North and South. In other words, the soldiers in the field are merely to prevent hostilities, but in the meantime, they are to consume the material wealth of the people, the victory to be finally accorded to the side which is capable of holding out the longest in this strange and unnatural campaign. If such is really to be the struggle, then why not avoid this useless waste of treasure, by at once coming to an ignoble compromise; for a victory obtained on Gen. SCOTT's plan would be a mere temporary cessation of hostilities between the North and the South, to be resumed again when the combatants recovered from mutual exhaustion. The fact that the rebels do not attack us is evidence that they feel it would be unsafe to do to; then why not vigorously drive the rebels from Virginia, and by destroying their prestige, if not at once end the war, at least let the people see that its end is not far distant. It is lamentable, indeed, that the delusion of the ""sacred soil of Virginia"" paralyzes the North and West.

As a further means of making the officers' duty as pleasant as possible, they may be united in companies as most agreeable to themselves, always regarding, however, their utility to discharge the duties they are to perform. Such an organization will secure the confidence of recruits, the approbation of our citizens, and approval of the highest Government authority, as regiments are now formed for the battle field without much time to drill, and every national, military and humane consideration demands that they should be well officered from the beginning. The whole plan has been so warmly approved by gentleman of the best military judgment, that the proposer is encouraged to assume the trouble of its organization, and will endeavor to carry it out, being at the same time disqualified by want of military experience for any position in an regiment after it is formed, but should his expectations be realized be will be amply rewarded by its high character and efficiancy.

Keep it up for some time, most noble Gorilla. It is just what we resi- dents and cant-get-aways have been wanting for some years. The effects of this blockade have been beneficial in many respects. We rejoice, especially, in its operation upon those heartless speculators who sought to forestall our market by buying up all the provisions in the city, and holding them for a big rise. The villainy was laid before the Governor, end steps were about to be taken to correct it by summary action on the part of the authorities or the people. when most seasonably and kindly POORE came with the Brooklyn and saved us all this trouble, by blockading the mouth of the river. Thus all export being stopped, both up and down the river, we have an abundance of everything that is produced between the Ohio and Missouri Rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. The effect on Texas cattle is particularly interesting. Large droves of these cattle have hitherto been driven northward into Missouri and even into Illinois; and even those which were sent hither had to compete with the better conditioned cattle of the West. Hence the supply was comparatively small. But now, having no other market, and being without competition, the Texans are all driving their cattle to New Orleans, not only supplying this market at very reasonable rates -- cheaper to fart, than the rates in the Northern cities -- but furnishing enough to send to the river towns, as far as Memphis. No less than two hundred head of these cattle were sent in that direction a few days ago. It is established now, beyond all doubt or uncertainty, that the vield of corn will far exceed the demands of the South, and new flour will be in the market to a few days in the greatest abundance. We may have less hog meat than we have hitherto had, but whether that will prove a loss or inconvenience remains to be proved.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BLOCKADE AT NEW-ORLEANS.; The New-Orleans Delta of the 16th says:', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BLOCKADE AT NEW-ORLEANS.; The New-Orleans Delta of the 16th says:', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/935dc9a4-be5a-58e4-8704-1810e1d974d4,358,nyt://article/935dc9a4-be5a-58e4-8704-1810e1d974d4,

DAVIS, BEAUREGARD, LEE and MAGRUDER are something more than holiday soldiers, the heroes of militia musters, and the victors in sham conflicts. They have been educated, to arms at the national expense, have served, creditably, and are conversant with all the resorts and advantages of modern warfare. They have the benefit also of intimate acquaintance with the composition and organization of the national army, the character and competency of its leaders, and the resources immediately avoidable to make it efficient in action. Nor is there any reason to believe the enemy to be deficient in the matter of subsistence. So long as the Virginia Central, and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroads remain in their hands, there will be no difficulty in procuring live stock from the great grazing region on the western slope of the Alleghanies; while Tennessee will supply and the Richmond mills will grind all the breadstuffs their army can consume. In the equipment and clothing departments they are perhaps less fortunate; but the season is genial, and the observe of otherwise indispensable articles of military wardrobe will not be severely felt until the approach of Winter.

It inculcates respect for individual rights, the safety of the persons of the citizens, and the inviolability of private property, guaranteeing liberty of speech and opinion to all; deprecating the stern necessities of war, and enjoining that forbearance and mercy which diminishes and softens its calamities.

They entered the Park from the east side, and presented a fine appearance as they came up, to take their position in front of the City Hall, for the purpose of being reviewed by the Mayor and members of the Common Council. In the absence of the Mayor, however, Col. BURNHAM, the City Marshal, stepped to the platform, where he remained during the whole exhibition, which continded nearly two hours. The Cadets were dressed in blue jackets, trimmed with gilt and red, red pants, and fatigue caps, and carried knapsacks and short bayonet muskets. The corps consists of forty-five boys and youth, whose ages rank from ten to twenty years, and they evinced by their superior drill in the Zouave tactics that their military education had been well attended to. The various evolutions peculiar to this system of manoeuvering were beautifully and faithfully executed, and the spectators present did not fail to testify their approbation by frequent and hearty applause. They were under the military command of Major HENEY LOCKWOOD, who is also connected with the Academy. After a severe exercise, in which they fully sustained their reputation as young soldiers, they were drawn up. In two columns facing the City Hall, and were presented with a beautiful banner by Gen. WRIGHT, of New-Jersey, on behalf of ladies who have taken an interest in the young and gallant soldiers. On presenting the banner, Gen. WRIGHT complimented them on the proficiency they had attained in military science. It was an inappropriate time for speech-making, and as they had been on the ground along time engaged in active and arduous drill, he would not occupy their attention but for a few minutes. He had been so pleased with their efforts that he had almost forgotten what he should say.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/30/archives/virginia-chivalry-and-guerilla-campaigning.html,,"It has been the boast of the South, and especially of Virginia, that her civilization was of a high and chivalrous character; that her men were all gentlemen, and her women all ladies. That they were more refined, more classical in their tastes, and better educated than any other race in the world, and particularly were they at a sightless distance above the money-getting, dollar-loving people of the Free States. They boasted of a more sublimated patriotism, a higher sense of honor, a loftier appreciation of soldierly duty, a more chivalrous courage, and a purer regard for the amenities of peace or war, with a profounder love for freedom in its broadest significance; in short that they were the only true specimens of American gentlemen extant, and that all outside of the Slave States were mere mongrels, indebted for whatever of gentle blood that flowed in their veins to crossing with the first families of Virginia, or some other of the States wherein the civilizing influences of Slavery were enjoyed. The world laughed at these silly pretensions, and they were subjects of special amusement to the Northern people; but inasmuch as they harmed nobody, and appeared to afford great satisfaction to those who entertained them, but little was thought or cared about the matter. The time, however, was approaching which was to subject these claims of superiority to a practical test. When it came, the boasted patriotism of Virginia turned out to be the rankest treason. Her vaunted honor, as embodied in her representative man, FLOYD, was found to consist in capabilities for plundering on a gigantic scale -- using the confidence of official trust as a cover for stealing from the Treasury and robbing the Government to an extent embracing in value millions upon millions of dollars. Her appreciation of soldierly duly, of military honor, was exemplified in the desertion by LEE, and LAY, and MAGRUDER, of the flag they had sworn to support, -- of the country that had educated and supported them, that had conferred honors upon and given them whatever of social or official respectability they ever enjoyed; and turning the education and experience they had acquired through the bounty of that Government, to the aid of rebellion for its overthrow. Her love of freedom was exemplified in the persecution, the banishment, or murder of citizens whose only crime was that they entertained sentiments of loyalty to the Constitution, and by the establishment of a lawless terrorism that utterly destroyed liberty of opinion, of speech and of the Press. Her courage has thus far been exemplified in running away whenever confronted with the loyal forces, and ensconcing behind conconcealed intrenchments and masked batteries, and firing upon opponents at times when they were unconscious of danger. Her appreciation of the amenities of civilized warfare is now to be exemplified in the formation or authorization of roving bands of Free Lances, whose only pay is the plunder they may secure, and whose cowardly warfare is waged only against weak or careless detachments, unarmed citizens and defenceless women. In no country, save Mexico, has this mode of warfare found favor or been tolerated, for the last three centuries. It is a relic of barbarism which civilization has everywhere rejected and condemned. These guerrilla hands have, in all Christian countries, been regarded as mere robbers and murderers, and, when taken, have been executed by summary process. But Virginia, cowering before the advance of the loyal armies, lays aside her boasted chivalry, and, by a solemn decree of her State Council, gives license to these organized marauders, and sends them out to plunder and to slay. It exemplifies the falsity of her pretensions, while it demonstrates the reality of her weakness.

There were weapons enough found to arm a regiment, and with ammunition sufficient for a battle. There can be no doubt that there are other private depots in the city equally well supplied with arms, nor that where were men selected who were relied upon to use them when the time should be ripe for a rising. Why there should be any hesitancy under such circumstances in proclaiming and enforcing martial law, passes our comprehension. It seems to us that the quiet of the city, the safety of the loyal troops and of the loyal and order-loving citizens demand it.

If the culprit guilty of these crimes escapes the halter, it is to sink into degradation and suffer under the contempt of all patriotic and true men. The exceptions to this rule are to be found only in the oppressions of the government sought to be overthrown, where the citizens suffering under a tyranny too grievous to be borne, rise in defence of their rights, and for the preservation of their liberties.

No longer are we paralyzed before the military attitudes of Gen. QUATTLEBUM, or struck dumb by the awful rhodomontade of Col. KEITT; Gov. PICKENS fulminates his edicts in the ears of his own petty niggerarchy only; the sweet though bloody notes of RHETT and SPRATT are heard no more; HAMMOND is as good as done for -- the mud-sills have effectuually fenced him in; and the little local newspapers, also, which erst chronicled Palmetto small beer to the wonderment of all mankind, now rave, and lie, and curse before a little audience, not a quarter of whom know their a, b, abs. Thus, South Carolina, of whose glory and prowess we have heard every day and dreamed every night for a quarter of a century, is now as effectually shut off from the great world as if she were sunk fathoms deep beneath the waves. She, before whose dread power all gods, men and negroes were supposed to tremble, now exhibits before them all her contemptible insignificance, her puny weakness. Her ambassadors to other empires are not permitted to sail from her own ports; her plenipotentiaries, now abroad, cannot return to her sacred soil without sneaking in through some back door; neither a newspaper nor a fibril of cotton can she export; neither an item of news nor a demijohn of whisky can she import, without begging permission of the Yankee dastard whom she has so often whipped ten to one. Probably she is whipping them yet -- in her newspapers. About the last we heard was that she had sent an immense army northward, who, after driving the Yankees from Virginia, were going to-march through Pennsylvania in triumph -- were proceeding to thrash Philadelphia, sack New-York, and put all Boston to the sword. They marched into Virginia on the double-quick, some two or three months ago, but suddenly came to a dead halt when they approached within rifle-crack of the advancing Yankees. If we could hear from KEITT, we have no doubt but we would learn that mountains of slaughtered Yankees were piled up all around them; while millions and millions of Abolitionists fled before them. But, thank Heaven! KEITT, RHETT, QUATTLEBUM, and all the other Palmetto Generals and Honorables are now locked in a prison-house, where the world neither hears their howlings nor fears their threats. If they could only be locked in for the rest of the century. America would enjoy peace and quiet, while the black and white Palmettos would probably by that time have pretty effectually used each other up.p",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT NATION OF SOUTH CAROLINA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT NATION OF SOUTH CAROLINA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dddc709f-2d15-51d7-ad43-4dc25a8ccb85,465,nyt://article/dddc709f-2d15-51d7-ad43-4dc25a8ccb85,

RUDD & CARLTON, his faithful interpreters, give us The Sea, another dreamy book, abounding with facts and fancles -- the latter predominating, of course. Our singular author approaches the sea with reverence and awe, yet subsequently he disports himself in the waters in such a manner as to induce the belief that in their wondrous depths is his most familiar home. He believes in sirens, and has a profound faith in the existence of mermen. He fishes pearls from the coral caves, and wreathes them about the brow of beauty with the most sensuous suggestions. The Oriental ladies of ""high degree,"" he tells us, more delicate and tasteful than our vulgar rich, shun the diamond, allowing their soft skin to be touched only by the pearl. ""In truth,"" says MICHELET, ""the brilliancy of the diamond is not in accordance with the light of love. A necklace and bracelets of fine pearls are the harmonious and true decorations for woman; instead of diverting the glance of the lover, they move him, make tenderness more tender -- say to him -- no noise; let us love!"" Thus we infer that the pearls are sensible and prudent as well as amorous. He traces an analogy between the pearl and the silken tunic, which the Odalisque wears close to her person, and loves so much that she will not part with it until it is worn and torn beyond all possibility of repair; believing it as she does to be a talisman, an infallible love charm. To a near Northern lover, a garment worn that length of time, and without washing, would prove a source of repulsion rather than of attraction, we fancy; -- commend us rather to the bosomed pearl, equally treasurable for associations, but lets absorptive than silk or linen.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f7283d8f-8763-5bb1-8614-74ab388e4fe2,2102,nyt://article/f7283d8f-8763-5bb1-8614-74ab388e4fe2,
