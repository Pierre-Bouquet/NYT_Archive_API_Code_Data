James Ragan and Charles Hogan, both young men, offered one of them to Casper Schneider, of No. 189 Bowery.

DIX being now authoritatively contradicted. Of the movements and intentions of BEAUREGARD and his rebel host, we receive various reports, the most recent of which was brought to Washington by a lady who escaped from Richmond after various vicissitudes. According to her statements, BEAUREGARD openly declares his intention to move towards Washington, and hopes yet to be able to obtain possession of it. His plan is to get as near the Arlington outposts as possible with his main force and to shell the city -- pushing his column on, meantime, to engage our forces, until he sees an opportunity to march upon the Capital with his reserve. This plan might undoubtedly be made to work, were it not for the fact that the Government has within call some seventy or eighty thousand well drilled troops to support a perfect cordon of artillery, which it will be necessary for the rebel forces to pass before they can hope to attain their end.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/834176bc-d54d-539e-b250-9766740a72d8,953,nyt://article/834176bc-d54d-539e-b250-9766740a72d8,

It seems to have cherished the idea that the Democratic Party was in favor of the treason of secession, and was ready to unite with the South in overthrowing the Constitution and destroying the Union. The City of New-York was largely Democratic, and the Southern Press and people counted on its earnest and cordial support. They expected to see the forts in the harbor seized, the arsenals plundered, the Sub-treasury dispoiled; that the secession bunting would float from the City Hall, and flaunt from the windows of Tammany and Mozart. There were three hundred thousand Democratic voters in the State, and they reckoned them as three hundred thousand Secessionists, who were as ready as themselves to hew away the pillars of the Republic and topple it into ruins. They could not conceive how a citizen could be loyal to the Union and yet be a Democrat. They could not understand bow he could oppose the success of the Republican Party before the election, and not be ready to take up arms against the Government administered by a Republican President afterwards. Professing to be Democrats themselves, they could not comprehend why treason should not be as cheap and common with Democracy at the North as at the South. Hence, when they opened their eves to the fact that Democracy on this side of Mason and Dixon's line was as true to the Constitution and faithful to the Union as was Republicanism itself, disappointment and mortification intensified their hatred towards those whom they foolishly regarded as their allies.

In the present disturbed state of America...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/02/archives/the-troops-for-canada.html,,"We are about to send a small army to Canada. This is just one of those steps upon which it is most difficult to pronounce an opinion, because we cannot suppose we have all the facts before us. In the present disturbed state of America reasons may exist for such a step which we cannot even guess, and we therefore approach the subject with hesitation and uncertainty. We do not deny that there may be excellent reasons for sending 3,000 men to Canada which we do not know; but we certainly can point to no reasons arising out of the existing state of things, so far as we are acquainted with them, which would lead us to such a conclusion. There is no doubt that America is in arms from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico; that the authority of the State and National Executive, never very strong, is shaken, and in many places suspended; that the passtons of a Democracy which can ill brook the slightest contradiction have been stung almost to frenzy by open revolt, and that for some unknown reason it has pleased the Northern States to empty all the vials of their wrath on the English nation It is also certain that, in accordance with their habit of blustering against an unoffending neighbor, England is threatened with undying hatred and condign punishment, because, in obedience to the first law of humanity and justice, we have declined to treat the people of the Southern States, carrying on war with the people of the Northern States, as pirates. This, according to the headlong logic of Democracy, is equivalent to a recognition of their independence, and although the Northern States themselves must be compelled in a very few weeks to make this very same admission. It is an offence never to be forgotten or forgiven. We are, besides, fully aware that Canada has a long and a very vulnerable frontier, and that threats have been uttered which point not obscurely to an invasion, not of sympathizers, as in 1837, but of free and enlightened citizens, who would come to punish us for not sufficiently sympathizing in their internal brawls. Nor are we ignorant that it is an old and often-tried policy in America to seek to heal internal discord by exciting popular hatred against England. In Canada itself affairs are by no means satisfactory. The relations between the English majority and the French minority cannot long continue as they are. Public confidence is shaken by the ill-success of the Grand Trunk Railway, by the vast amount of debt accumulated for municipal purposes, or, as it is said, in order to bribe majorities, and by the return to the antiquated practices of Protection. In all these things, the force of which we by no means wish to extenuate, many may see a sufficient justification for the despatch of 3,000 men to Canada, but, for our part, if there are no better reasons than these, we regret that the step has been taken.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TROOPS FOR CANADA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TROOPS FOR CANADA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0e56c8d4-a376-5dc6-a221-a95ffdb9c10b,1429,nyt://article/0e56c8d4-a376-5dc6-a221-a95ffdb9c10b,

"""Progress is stronger than we are,"" was the reply of an eminent European statesman to certain timid people, who demanded a change of his policy for fear of its results upon the financial condition of the country.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/02/archives/no-compromise-with-treason.html,,"""Progress is stronger than we are,"" was the reply of an eminent European statesman to certain timid people, who demanded a change of his policy for fear of its results upon the financial condition of the country. It furnishes a capital answer to the timid people of the present day, who talk of compromise and demand peace. This war is emphatically a war of progress, the elements of which have been at work for more than a third of a century, and there is but one condition on which it can be terminated. The statesmen of the last generation saw its shadow on the horizon; and while they hoped for a peaceful solution of the dangers looming on their vision, yet that a revolution of some kind was inevitable they never for a moment doubted. They saw how the Southern States by their solidarity, by making their peculiar institutions a bond of political union, wielded the power and shaped the policy of the Government, and they saw how restive the Northern millions were under their domination. They calculated the time when the constantly increasing numbers in the Free States, asserting the might vested in majorities, would seize the reins of Government and control its action with reference to what they regarded the great interests of civilization and the best good of the whole country, rather than with reference to the institutions and special interests of the South. They saw that the time would come when twenty millions of people in the Free States would refuse to submit to the dictation of eight millions in the Slave States, and that the passing of political power from one to the other, would be likely to be attended by convulsions such as had never been known in the history of this country. They postponed the evil days by temporary concessions, by compromises, in the permanency of which they had little faith, and which they felt certain would some day be powerless to defer the crisis which they saw impending. They noted the increasing arrogance of the South consequent upon the possession of power, and foresaw how deep its humiliation would be when the great constitutional principle which grants to majorities the right to govern, should remove the sceptre from its hand. They hoped that that principle would be respected, and that the minority would yield to an inevitable destiny; but in the character and temper of that minority they saw the possible germs of upheaval and rebellion against the Union. They saw that the pernicious doctrine of nullification was ripening into secession, and that a reckless ambition might seize upon it as a pretext for revolt, giving to treason towards the Constitution and the Union a semblance of patriotism under the guise of loyalty to the State.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'No Compromise with Treason.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'No Compromise with Treason.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a54824f1-831f-59f7-96e6-afd27808775f,924,nyt://article/a54824f1-831f-59f7-96e6-afd27808775f,

The greatest rivalship is evinced to see who can be the first in the new corps; and those are wretched who come too late when the number is filled up, and when they cannot be received in a favorite regimen. An enthusiasm which cannot be understood in a monarchical Government seizes on an entire city when the drums beat for volunteer recruits; when accomplished officers are selected; and when a proper Colonel is named for the command. The bands, the uniforms, the polished arms, the gallant companions, the orderly march under bristling steel, awaken an involuntary feeling like an electric shock; and set thousands of men half mad for the coming fight. All classes seem wild withpatriotism, with liberty, and with the glorious love of their own free country.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/04/archives/onward-at-last.html,,"Intimations reach us from various sources, having access to official information, of an immediate advance of the main body of our army. It is stated that unless the enemy prefers retreat to a collision, a general engagement will certainly be had before Monday next, for before that day, Gen. SCOTT, at the head of his forces, designs to occupy Fairfax Court-house and Manassas Junction, at the cost, if necessary, of a battle. The probability, however, is that no battle will occur. There is every reason to believe that the rebels are not in sufficient strength to hazard a general action; since all authorities concur in numbering the advance commanded by BEAUREGARD, and consisting of detachments at the Court-house, the Junction, at Centreville, and at Culpepper, as not exceeding an aggregate of 25,000 men, very imperfectly prepared for a conflict with thrice that force which Gen. SCOTT is able to fling upon them. The policy of the rebel leaders, judging from the laborious efforts they are making to fortify Richmond, is to fall back to the James River, and make their stand under the shadow of the rebel Capital. Gen. SCOTT will probably urge his southward march along the Potomac, until, by placing MAGRUDER's corps between himself and Gen. BUTLER, he will compel that body of rebels to surrender; and then, cooperating with Gen. BUTLER, his army will approach Richmond upon both banks of the James simultaneously. In the meantime, Gen. PATTERSON will continue to advance along the foot of the Blue Ridge, until he effects a junction with a portion of Gen. MCCLELLAN's force, emerging from the valley at Charlottesville; and the rebels will thus be so nearly surrounded as to be forced to give battle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Onward at Last.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Onward at Last.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0e3dacea-cc43-5595-8744-3a1482c5cedc,342,nyt://article/0e3dacea-cc43-5595-8744-3a1482c5cedc,

The advancing column was met by the enemy in force at Porterfield's Farm, on the turnpike road near Hainesville, where the conflict was fierce for a time; but the rebels were finally compelled to give way, and then retreat soon became precipitate. They left behind them numbers of their dead and wounded, and a great many articles of value, and Gen. PATTERSON subsequently occupied their camp.

The dangers which now threaten their liberties, have revived in the hearts of the people the patriotism that animated their forefathers, and many an old fogy who has been wont to regard the great gunpowder festival as a nuisance and a bore, will to day enter with spirit into, the festivities, and smile approvingly upon the ""noise and confusion"" with which Young America seeks to honor the great natal day of our independence. The military display will not be so large as usual, in consequence of the absence at the seat of war of the larger portion of the militia of this Division; but to make up for the deficiency a novel and not less interesting feature will be introduced in the marshaling of over 6000 of the boys belonging to the public schools, who will be dressed in uniform and join in the military parade. The line will be formed in Fourteenth-street and University-place, at 7 1/2 A.M., and will move as laid down in the published programme. Among the indoor celebrations the great feature of the day will be the oration of Hon. EDWARD EVERETT at the Academy of Music, for the benefit of the families of volunteers. Rev. E.H. CHAPIN will also deliver an oration at the Cooper Institute, for the benefit of the ""Ladies' Society for the relief of Volunteers"" The ancient Tammany Society will celebrate the day in their usual style Gen. HIRAN WALLBRIDGE being the orator of the occasion. There will also be a celebration, with music and addresses, &c., at the Dutch Reformed Church in Twenty-third-street, west of Sixth-avenue. The day will be observed in the customary manner at the public institutions on the Islands. In Brooklyn, Jersey City, Staten Island, &c., the occasion will be appropriately observed. Numerous pleasure excursions to the various places of resort in the vicinity of the City have been planned, for the details of which we refer the reader to our advertising columns. There will be a brilliant display of fireworks in the evening at the City Hall Park, Madison-square, Tompkins-square.

With what sincerity and heartiness the detailed accounts which we publish elsewhere will testify. To the majority of those who assisted in the various exercises of the occasion it was something more than a mere holiday. The aspect of the day was that of a great National Thanksgiving -- of a pious opportunity for recognizing a great political fact, rendered peculiarly impressive by the circumstance that for the moment it has been blindly, madly forgotten by our brothers in a portion of the still smiling land. In the social world there are gatherings of kindred, where amidst congratulations, kindly greetings and jovial good fellowship, there is still a thought for the absent ones. A deep and sincere hope brims the heart that they may be with us next year. So was it yesterday. There was a tacit understanding, a mute regret that some we loved were away; that many who have heretofore shared our triumph were no longer by our side to great us with the vital grasp of a great national brotherhood. Thoughts like these were in the minds of the people, and gave to the day an earnestness and significance which has never before been demanded or experienced. We live in the midst of the most pathetic history ever vouchsafed to a free people. Quick, electrical, finely strung as are our masses, they are peculiarly susceptible of being overwhelmed with generous emotion. Who can forget the great sob of mingled pride and joy that came from them when the first volunteers passed from our sight to struggle for the glorious traditions of the day which yesterday we celebrated. And when the day itself reached us, there was an effusion of rapture which has only been paralleled in the greatest moments of our national existence.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CELEBRATION OF THE FOURTH.; Great Gathering at the Academy of Music.

McCORMICK for the renewal of his patent for improvement in grain reaping-machines. Readers will remember that a few months ago the patentee made no pretence of relying on the Press, or upon public sentiment consolidated by the Press, for the extension of his burdensome and oppressive monopoly. His reliance then was on the acting chief of the Patent Bureau, whose conduct foreshadowed so clearly his determined purpose to extend the McCormick patent, right or wrong, that Congress stepped in, and by special legislation wrested the case from his hands, and transferred the question to the new Administration for its decision. That decision is soon to be rendered, and the patentee and his agents are bringing every possible effort to bear to delude the new Commissioner of Patents into extending a monopoly against which the entire farming interest protests earnestly, and with good reason. We had supposed even the inventive genius of MCCORMICK unequal to the task of securing any positive aid in his schemes from the Tribune, a journal which especially claims to be regardful of the farmer's interests. We have not forgotten that when a corrupt Administration seemed just on the eve of renewing the monopoly in question for seven years more, our neighbor had no word of remonstrance; but we could not anticipate that it would lend its columns directly to the work of bolstering an extension project which has already taxed the farming interest about fifty dollars on each and every reaper manufactured.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The McCormick Reaper Patent.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The McCormick Reaper Patent.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f5a6d24-f6b2-5687-a3d1-2f0fe57a8c12,632,nyt://article/4f5a6d24-f6b2-5687-a3d1-2f0fe57a8c12,

As the time wore on arrivals became more frequent, and the open space gradually became peopled with groups both sexes, until at length the whole area was completely covered with an expectant and eager multitude. With the nearer approach to darkness, came additional spectators, who joining their predecessors, made the concourse so vast that every inch of standing room was taken, and ingress through the lower gates seemed almost impossible. Every available place that could afford a glimpse at the brilliant exhibition was speedily occupied, not excepting the numerous trees, whose branches, in many instances, sustained such a tremendous pressure, that they were momentarily in danger of giving way and precipitating their living burdens to the ground. Park Row and a portion of Broadway were nearly blocked by the immense crowd, and the windows and roofs of the surrounding buildings showed a dense mass of human faces and forms. In the Park a chain was placed a few yards from the steps leading to the Hall, and inclosed a large area, which was occupied principally by holders of tickets and privileged persons. A guard of police were stationed at intervals round the circle, who succeeded admirably in preserving order and preventing any encroachments from without. A staging was erected a short distance from the Hall, upon which was stationed Shelton's Band of twelve pieces, who discoursed patriotic music from the commencement to the end of the exhibition.

The Senate did no business on the first day, but Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts, gave notice of his intention to introduce various bills rendered necessary by the condition of the country, a list of which may be found in our report of the proceedings. Yesterday, GEORGE T. BROWN, was elected Sergeant-at-Arms on the first ballot. Mr. CHANDLER, of Michigan, gave notice that he should introduce a bill to confiscate the property of leading rebels in the South, the proceeds to be applied to the indemnification of Union men who may have suffered losses on account of the acts of such rebels. Notice having been received of the organization of the House, a committee was appointed to wait on the President, and notify him of the readiness of Congress to proceed to business, and a short recess was taken. On reassembling, the President's Message was received and read. We publish this important document in full elsewhere. In the House on Thursday, almost the first business after the roll had been called was the election of Speaker. But one ballot was had -- the contest being between Messrs. GROW, of Pennsylvania, and BLAIR, of Missouri. Mr. COLFAX would not suffer his name to be used, and so announced to his friends. When the vote was taken it was found there was no choice, when Mr. BLAIR withdrew, and his vote was transfered to Mr. GROW -- thus electing that gentleman. Mr. GROW, on taking the Chair, made an earnest and telling address of thanks. The members were then sworn in by delegations. Some objection was made to the Virginia delegation by Mr. BURNETT, of Kentucky, but the objection was overcome. Some other trifling delay was occasioned by cases of contested election, when the House proceeded to the choice of Clerk, and the first ballot resulted in the election of Mr. ETHEREDGE, of Tennessee. Mr. VALLANDIGHAM, of Ohio, gave notice of his intention to introduce a bill to repeal the Tariff act of 1861, and substitute that of 1858 with revisions. Yesterday Ex-Congressman BALL was chosen Sergeant-at-Arms; IRA GOODENOW, of New-York, Doorkeeper, and Rev. Mr. STOCKTON, Chaplain. The President's Message was received and read, portions of it being greeted with applause from the floor and galleries. Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania, gave notice of a bill to repeal all laws creating ports of entry in the rebellious States, and a bill providing for the holding of a United States Court in Wheeling. The House soon afterwards adjourned.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e0df5b82-cc0c-5eb4-a409-8f915b0910ba,1744,nyt://article/e0df5b82-cc0c-5eb4-a409-8f915b0910ba,

At the firing of the sunrise salute, when the Star Spangled Banner was run up on board of the vessels-of-war, and upon the different military posts, the vessels in the harbor, as if by one common impulse, hoisted, first the old flag of the Union to their mastheads, and then brought out their international codes and the flags of all nations, by way of giving additional significance to the display. All the ferry-boats on the East and North Rivers, the arriving steamers, ships at anchor in the stream, and vessels at the wharves, large and small, American and foreign, each vied with the other in seeing which could make the finest display of bunting. The Cunard steamers at Jersey City, as if anxious to fully express the cordial sympathy of their Government with our own, were early dressed out in their gayest holiday costume. The same was true of all the foreign sailing vessels and steamers lying in the East and North Rivers. The ferry boats flitting across the bay with their decks crowded with passengers, and decorated with flags, was a very inspiring spectacle. The excursion steamers, of which there were a large number, were handsomely decorated with bunting.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PATRIOTIC DISPLAY OF FLAGS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PATRIOTIC DISPLAY OF FLAGS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2362483-0620-5b94-9620-ac8b6d3aab2a,241,nyt://article/e2362483-0620-5b94-9620-ac8b6d3aab2a,

We do not seek to improve upon the past, except so far as to curb and repress those tendencies which have involved us in civil war. Our people desire no better Government than that under the fostering care of which they have made a progress which is really the marvel of the world. The restoration of the Government to an authority as wide as that of our domain, is a proposition upon which the loyal States are already united to a man, and for which our people are prepared to make the last of all sacrifices -- that of life itself. Such a purpose commands universal sympathy and support, and, carefully adhered to, will preserve us from discontent at home, and from those factions and partisan cabals which are often more to be feared than a formidable army in the field. It is not what we may be called upon to endure that we have to fear, but that we may not have an adequate motive to sustain us in our trial. With such, the satisfaction resulting from the maintenance of a principle is always in proportion to the difficulties encountered. We are never so contented and cheerful as under the sacrifices we are called upon to make, provided these are sanctified and ennobled by a great purpose.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'National Restoration.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'National Restoration.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/45c1b542-9559-5e96-9681-e008a6fd2944,860,nyt://article/45c1b542-9559-5e96-9681-e008a6fd2944,

"Of all the States that have escaped the curse of secession, there is not one that has so much cause for rejoicing as Missouri. Her normal position is in connection with the Free States. Her climate, soil, productions, her immense mineral resources, the development of which will one day place her among the richest States of the Union, all unmistakably indicate that her prosperity will always depend upon the employment in the main of free, and not of slave labor. Bordered, too, as she is, on three sides by Free States, exposing her continually to the inroads of free sentiments, and the direct influence of free institutions, slave property would cease to be desired or profitable, while its liability to escape would always render it too insecure for investment. Though the sympathies and prejudices of a large portion of her people were, for the present, with the South, yet the inexorable logic of events was linking all her interests indissolubly with the North and the East. The construction of railroads, connecting her immediately with the Eastern cities and the commerce of the ocean, relieved her from dependence on the Gulf by means of the Mississippi, which not many years ago was the great and only thoroughfare of northwestern trade and travel. Merchandise purchased in New-York, Boston or Philadelphia, found its way to St. Louis by New-Orleans, whence it was reshipped some fifteen hundred miles up the current of the Mississippi to that city. Goods purchased in New-Orleans had, in the main, been purchased by the New-Orleans merchant in New-York or New-England, and the consumer in Missouri had thus to pay the double profits of the two sets of jobbers through whose hands they had passed. With the construction of Railroads came a great change in the currents of Missouri commerce and trade. It set with a continually increasing volume towards the Atlantic instead of the Gulf cities. Not only was Missouri looking to the East for a market wherein she could make her purchases, but she was sending a large proportion of her surplus products in that direction to be sold. Every year increased the amount of this reciprocal trade, and another decade will connect her as indissolubly with the Northern Atlantic States as is Ohio, Illinois or any other Western or Northwestern State. With a kindly feeling, which late events have strengthened, rather than diminished, the North and the East will pour a continually increasing tide of hardy emigration into her fertile valleys, and Northern and Eastern capital and enterprise will aid in developing the unexampled richness of her mineral resources. Had she permitted herself to be entangled with secession it is easy to perceive how fatal it would have been to her material prosperity. She would have surrounded herself with enemies instead of friends. She would have thrown away the advantages of position, of intercourse and commerce with those to whom she was united by the bonds of a common interest, surrendered her prestige as the great State of the West, and shut her gates against an immigration of labor and capital so necessary to the development of the mighty sources of wealth hidden in her mountains, and in the unequaled richness of her soil.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/08/archives/the-escape-of-missouri.html,,"Of all the States that have escaped the curse of secession, there is not one that has so much cause for rejoicing as Missouri.

"Sojourners at Saratoga Springs during the month of August last will perhaps remember a spare, sinewy, lithe-framed little man who was daily visible in the parlors and promenades of one of the principal hotels of that place. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/08/archives/new-publications.html,,"Sojourners at Saratoga Springs during the month of August last will perhaps remember a spare, sinewy, lithe-framed little man who was daily visible in the parlors and promenades of one of the principal hotels of that place. With singularly self-possessed manners, yet of modest and unassuming deportment withal, and keen and searching black eyes, which neither wavered nor fell in conversation; beyond these there was nothing to distinguish their possessor from the great crowd of idlers who yearly go down to the Spa to seek a shelter from the scorching sun of Summer, and lave their throats with its pleasant waters. That lithe little man was DU CHAILLU -- the author of the volume before us -- a man who has carried the touch of exploration where it has never before been borne -- penetrated the veil which shrouds the burning heart of Africa, and left his footprints on the summits of mountains, whose very existence was before but a matter of conjecture. During the four years which embraced these explorations -- to use the author's own very modest summary of his exploits and adventures -- he traveled (always on foot and unaccompanied by any other white man) about 8,100 miles. He shot, stuffed, and brought home over 2,000 birds, of which more than 60 are new species; and killed upward of 1,000 quadrupeds, of which 200 were stuffed and brought home, with more than 80 skeletons. Not less than 20 of these quadrupeds are hitherto unknown to science. He suffered fifty attacks of the African fever, taking, to cure himself, over fourteen ounces of quinine. Of famine, long-continued exposures to the heavy tropical rains, and attacks of ferocious ants and ravenous flies, our author does not think it worth while to speak, though those of us who shrink from the bite of our own mitigated mosquitoes will incline to think, that from these multiplied martyrdoms alone he has claims upon our sympathies. If DU CHAILLU ventures to visit Saratoga again, we predict that his presence there will be known, and that those who have an opportunity of looking into the eyes that have undauntedly faced death in a thousand different forms will make ""a note of it.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/39a0cd14-c24b-5762-93fc-74bedd775255,3712,nyt://article/39a0cd14-c24b-5762-93fc-74bedd775255,

The reason, we are taught to believe, is extremely simple. The South, by the confession of its journals and leaders, is almost destitute of gunpowder. It has men, and courage, and guns; it has no objection to sacrificing that pure Southern blood which we of the North, unworthy, seek to spill; it is not holding back in the hope of a compromise; nor has any angel of mercy spiked the eager cannon. None, indeed, of the manifold reasons which have been interpleaded to account for the indisposition of ex-Capt. BRAGG to spend a little more grape, or shell, or round shot, meets the case. It is simply the want of the fatal grain which brings all things to a pause. The holiday bombardment of Fort Sumter cost the very life blood of the rebel warfare. Fifty or a hundred tons of gunpowder are not to be had on demand at the retail groceries of Florida, or even in Virginia; and the difficulty is enhanced when the required article is to be of a specific kind, for which no substitute is admissible.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Want of the Rebels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Want of the Rebels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ead66f13-55a1-510a-93f5-bdafb729c420,823,nyt://article/ead66f13-55a1-510a-93f5-bdafb729c420,

The early colonists reenacted the laws to which they had been trained, with slight modifications to adapt them to their new surroundings. The war of the Revolution was not to change, but to maintain these laws, sought to be subverted and overthrown by the British Crown. There was nothing new in the formation of the Confederation or of the Federal Government. This was simply the union of the several Colonies for mutual profit and protection. One has only to read the debates in the Convention for the formation of the Constitution, and the arguments to which the proposition gave rise, to see how sedulously every precedent was examined; to furnish guides for deliberation and action. Up to the adoption of the Constitution only a slight divergence of sentiment had prevailed between different parts of the country. A common necessity had imposed common occupations and common objects to all -- contests with savage tribes, and with a powerful nation which, for a long time, held the larger and fairer, portion of our country, and the incessant labor necessary to subdue a continent, and to provide the means for supporting life. The people were too poor to be luxurious, and too much engrossed in their labors to plot mischief either against each other or the Government. The white man worked by the side of the slave. The vicissitudes of frontier life preserved the whole people in energy and vigor.

The temper of the members is not to be mistaken. In the Senate a joint resolution was offered by Mr. WADE, of Ohio, and referred to the Committee on Finance, providing for the remission of all duties on arms imported for use in the suppression of rebellion. The joint resolution legalizing all the recent acts of the President, and the bill authorizing the employment of volunteers in enforcing the laws, were referred back from the Committee on Military Affairs, and laid over under the rule. They will probably be passed to-day. In the House, the Standing Committees were announced, and after some trifling changes the members went to work in good earnest. A disposition being shown by several to introduce unnecessary business to attention, the House adopted a resolution, introduced by Mr. HOLMAN, of Indiana, providing for the consideration only of those bills and resolutions concerning military and naval appropriations, and other financial affairs -- all other bills and resolutions to be referred without debate to the appropriate Committees, to be considered at the next regular session of Congress. This resolution was subsequently amended by adding a clause providing for the consideration of general questions of a judicial character, and thus stand for the guidance of legislation. Mr. LOVEJOY, of Illinois, offered a series of resolutions declaring against a return of fugitive slaves; instructing the Judiciary Committee to inquire into the expediency of repealing the Fugitive Slave Law, and censuring the authorities for restoring Major EMORY to the Army; but they were tabled, 87 to 62. The various branches of the President's Message were referred to the appropriate Committees, and the contested election cases were referred to the Committee on Elections. Mr. VAN WYCK, of New-York introduced a bill increasing the pay of soldiers, and providing for Government retrenchment by the reduction of salaries and other means; also, a resolution, which was adopted, providing for the appointment of a Special Committee to inquire into the matter of contracts. Among other important motions adopted, was one made by Mr. LOOMIS, of Connecticut, instructing the Judiciary Committee to prepare and report a bill to confiscate the property of all office-holders found in arms against the Government. An address was presented by Mr. DIVEN, and referred to the Judiciary Committe, declaring the determination of the Government to replace the flag of the Union over the whole Republic.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/98e79e7a-cad4-5dcf-843a-653b3c5ae2c9,1600,nyt://article/98e79e7a-cad4-5dcf-843a-653b3c5ae2c9,

When it is inspected by the practiced eye of Gen. SCOTT, it will, we are persuaded, win from the veteran a generous meed of praise, which has not been exceeded by any other regiment from this State. The men are drawn from our best industrial classes. They are tough and tenacious of pupose, but well-informed and infinitely above the ordinary run of volunteers. The temper of the regiment has been formed by the officers, who are men of experience and social position. The Colonel, LEOPOLD VON GILSA, was educated in the military school of Germany, having commenced his studies at the age of ten years. He has seen service, and in the war of Schleswig-Holstein was decorated three times upon the field of battle. The Major (HOLMSTEAD) was an officer in our Mexican war, and returns to arms with the feelings of a victor. The Lieutenant-Colonel (DUYSING) is a Hessian by birth and a soldier by profession. The first company was formed by this officer, who may therefore be regarded in some degree as the father of the regiment. The Captains and Lieutenants are nearly all men who have seen active service. One of the number was mapograp r of the Geographical Society, and another was recently Assistant Engineer of the Central Park.

MILLER, Esq., of Owensboro, Ky., who alleges that arms were purchased by him in the East to be distributed in his town for home protection; that he is a true, loyal citizen of the Union, and that as an insurrection among the negroes was apprehended in his neighborhood, the pistols were purchased to be used if such an event occurred. The District-Attorney filed an information in the United States District Court before Judge LEAVITT, on Thursday, asking that usual process be issued, confiscating the thirteen pistols to the use of the United States. Mr. MILLER, in his answer, sets forth that the pistols were purchased solely for himself and citizens of Owensboro, who are loyal to the Government of the United States, in the defence of the families and property of said town from negro insurrection and marauding parties. The case was supported on each side by evidence of witnesses and depositions. One witness stated that in Owensboro the Union men and Secessionists were equally divided; that he, with others, were apprehensive of an attack from Secessionists; that many Knights of the Golden Circle resided there, and were regarded as dangerous citizens, and that Owensboro was in JACKSON's district, recently elected to Congress who had proclaimed that he would vote men and means to sustain the Government of the United States.

The bill to increase the Army was reported back from the Military Committee, with an amendment increasing the old regiments to the same number as the new. Action on this was postponed for the eulogies on Senator DOUGLAS, which were pronounced by Senators TRUMBULL, MCDOUGALL, COLLAMER, and others. In the House, the first business was the passage of a bill appropriating six millions for the payment of the militia and volunteers recently called into service. A Loan bill was reported from the Committee of Ways and Means, and will be called up to-day. The Committee on Commerce was instructed to inquire if any further legislation is necessary to secure the forfeiture and condemnation of piratical vessels. The same Committee reported a bill, which was ordered to be printed and recommitted, further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, etc. This bill is designed to close the ports of entry in the seceded States, to make ports of delivery ports of entry in certain cases, and to provide for the collection of duties on shipboard whenever it may be necessary. Mr. LOVEJOY, of Illinois, introduced a resolution, which constituted one of the series introduced by him on Monday, declaring that it is no part of the duty of soldiers of the United States to capture or return fugitive slaves.

Up to this moment she has had nothing but prosperity in crime. The military prestige of the campaign, until Gen. LYON started in pursuit of a runaway Governor of Missouri, was entirely hers. Her soldiers passed northward into Virginia flushed with the opening victory of the war. Ruin, to be sure, has fallen upon her material interests; her railroads are unemployed; banking capital is idle or squandered in Confederate bonds; her warehouses and wharves are deserted; but these calamities she suffers in common with all the Stakes, including those whose loyally would have saved them from such evils but for this pestilent little member of the Union. What we have a right to demand is some special allotment of punishment to fall heavily upon the originators of this National trouble. The people chafes at the sight of the tranquility and apparent comfort of the community, which has destroyed quiet and comfort everywhere else; and wants to know if steps are not to be taken to bring the delinquent to special and vindictive justice.

Hereafter, it is to oppose no formidable resist- ance at any given point, the peculiar institution requiring all the able-bodied men in every portion of the South to remain at home as a local police. Even in the great strait in which Virginia is placed, with a hundred thousand National troops upon her soil, and upon the eve of a battle which is to decide the fate of Secession, the South Carolina regiments recently stationed at Manassas Gap are on their way home. Nothing can be more significant than this of the condition of affairs in that State. Not even the recent announcement of Gov. PICKENS to the Confederate Government that no more of its troops can be sent beyond its own limits. The battle to be fought in Virginia concerns South Carolina as much as if it was to be fought on her own soil. The Confederate Government, of which she is really the author, and with the maintenance of which secession is identified, is located at Richmond. If driven from this place, the cause is utterly lost. Yet, in this crowning emergency, South Carolina, the great author of the rebellion, and which is to be disgraced and ruined if this rebellion is crushed, can render no further aid. All her soldiers are required for the preservation of domestic order, to repress insurrections of slaves. Georgia is in a similar condition. Her Governor has just announced that no more of her soldiers can be sent to other States, not even to poor Virginia, which has so adroitly been made the battle-field. Alabama is stated to have made a similar order in reference to the troops of that State. The recent proclamation of the Governor of Mississippi, in reference to the arming of that State with double-barreled shot-guns shows that the emergency there is a negro insurrection, not the repelling of the National troops, who are not to be driven back by such weapons.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Culmination of the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Culmination of the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f65f3902-d780-57f3-aec4-a027c017836b,1031,nyt://article/f65f3902-d780-57f3-aec4-a027c017836b,

SEIGEL, of the United States forces, at the head of about fifteen hundred men. The collision occurred about seven miles north of Carthage. Col. SIEGEL gave battle, and the Secessionists fell back, suffering greatly, Gov. JACKSON, or his officers, ordered a retreat, but his flanks did not hear the order, and the advancing United States troops soon found themselves nearly surrounded, and were obliged to retire. They retreated slowly, keeping up the fight, the artillery making ""fearful havoe"" in the secession ranks. The battle continued until dark, when Col. SEIGEL reached Carthage, where he had 400 reserves. Col. SEIGEL's total loss, in this day's work, is reported to be five killed and two mortally wounded, with, of course, an average of minor casualties. The secession loss is reported to be very large, but as they advanced and occupied the field of battle at the close, no correct account of it can be given.

It appears that the total amount appropriated for County purposes last year was- $3,651,247 53, of which only $3,371,590 58 has been expended, leaving in the Treasury a balance of $279,656 95, and the Committee advised the using of this balance for the benefit of the families. Of the unexpended fund it had been designed to appropriate for arrearages, $9,382 06; for Harlem Bridge, $220 64; for Coroners fees $7. 143 48; for County contingencies, $17,232 08; for election expenses, $11,675 99; for lighting, cleaning, and supplies, $4,027 13 : for officers and witnesses' fees, $1,746 36; for rent, $5,343 34; for repairs, $5,398 90; for new Court-House, $100,000. It was not thought advisable that the families should be compelled to wait for aid, simply because the Board were in doubt as to their power to sue revenue bonds. Attached was a resolution authorizing the Comptroler to draw his warrant for the sum of $163,070 18 -- amount of balances of the appropriations for the support of the County Government for 1860 -- and tender the same to the Union Defence Committee, to be used exclusively for the support of the families of volunteers from the City and County of New-York, and that the said Committee be required to report the disposition of the fund when called upon for that purpose by the Board.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.; AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE FAMILIES OF VOLUNTEERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.; AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE FAMILIES OF VOLUNTEERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/398ddf66-ceb3-5a4c-b264-2f15d26349c6,323,nyt://article/398ddf66-ceb3-5a4c-b264-2f15d26349c6,

The dis- patches announcing these occurrences are con- tradictory, and evidently of an exaggerated character; but making all due allowances for exaggerations, and steering carefully between the contradictions, we arrive at a tolerably fair idea of the truth. Gov. JACKSON -- who, it appears, did not fly to Arkansas as reported -- and Gen. RAINS, at the head of at least ten thousand State troops, were met on Friday last at Brier Forks, near Carthage, by Col. SIEGEL, at the head of only fifteen hundred National troops, who immediately gave them battle. The State troops, notwithstanding their immense numerical superiority, were driven back, and the order was given to retreat. Col. SIEGEL, finding that in following the enemy his command was likely to become surrounded, ordered his command back, and then retired slowly, keeping up a murderous fire of artillery all the while. In this way Col. SIEGEL continued retiring until he received a reinforcement of two hundred men, when he again assumed the offensive, and drove JACKSON's forces back with great slaughter. The National loss in this affair appears to have been inconsiderable, while that of the State troops, it is thought, cannot be less than from three to five hundred. A later dispatch states that Col. SIEGEL's force, while encamped on the succeeding night, was attacked by Gov. JACKSON and severely cut up. This, however, we consider improbable, from the fact that on the 6th he was reported to have been reinforced by Gen. SWEENEY with his entire force, and to be in pursuit of JACKSON's army near Vernon. JACKSON had announced his intention to fortify himself at Carthage, and to await the arrival of Gen. PRICE and BEN. MCCULLOUGH from Arkansas, with reinforcements, when he would act on the offensive, and ""enforce the laws of the State."" He has probably by this time changed his mind.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/860ad2fa-ec13-5dad-b810-bf2fa4dc545d,1777,nyt://article/860ad2fa-ec13-5dad-b810-bf2fa4dc545d,

Bacon et al. vs. William Hickock and six others -- The action in this case is brought upon a bond of indemnity, conditioned to pay the amount of $7,927,71, the gross amount of three several promissory notes, made by the Damascus Iron Company. The bond of indemnity was given by the defendants, pursuant to an agreement containing several recitals, among which were the following: ""And the said obligees (plaintiffs) have consented to discontinue said suit, and extend such time of payment by taking new notes, as hereinafter mentioned, provided the above-named obligors will become individually and personally bound to said obligees as indorsers on such new notes, to which condition the obligors have assented, except that they prefer to fix their liability in this behalf by a bond of indemnity, instead of indorsements, to which preference the said obligees have yielded their assent."" Then follows the obligation in these words: ""Now, therefore, the condition of the above obligation is such, that if the said Company shall well and truly pay the three several promissory notes given herein, when they become due, and if the obligors shall well and truly, indemnify the said obligees of and from all loss and damage, by reason of such non-payment, then the obligation to be void."" The Company failed to pay. An action was brought on the bond, for the non-payment of one of these notes. The complaint did not show that there had been any notice of demand on the notes given to the defendants, as indorsers, and it did not show that the plaintiffs had endeavored to collect the money of the Company, and had failed to collect it. The defendants demurred to this complaint, and assigned as their objections -- that, although the security was in the form of a bond, the liability of the defendants was strictly that of indorsers, and they were entitled to be treated in all respects as such, before they could be made liable on the bond. Counsel further contended that actual loss and damage must be averred before the plaintiffs could recover of the defendants.

ANDREW JINNEMAN, a German, 35 years of age, whose death had resulted from violence. The following facts were elicited: the deceased was engaged, with several other persons, on the 4th inst., to furnish music at a beer garden in Guttenburg, N.J., of which E. EISLES is proprietor. The band did all it could to please the patrons of the establishment, but after a while some of the dancers became dissatisfied, owing, perhaps, to their copious libations, and insisted that the music was not sufficient, either in quality or quantity. Meanwhile, the pleasure-seekers were receiving continual accessions to their numbers, and fresh sets took the floor, until it was apparent that the band and their instruments were blown to an unendurable degree, and the music ceased. This turn of affairs was not at all to the liking of the dancers, who loudly demanded that the music should be continued, and after a short respite, the band made another effort, which only resulted in an undignified break-down. The sudden stop which this put to the amusements infuriated the Tentons, and after much introductory quarreling, they went to fighting. In the melee JINNEMAN was beaten so badly that his death resulted from the injuries, after he had languished several days in intense pain. The jury declared that he came to his death from peritonitis, brought on by injuries received at the hands of persons to them unknown.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f60fbe13-2026-5eb2-b87e-3e52821c5107,563,nyt://article/f60fbe13-2026-5eb2-b87e-3e52821c5107,

A very marked and interesting example is furnished by the deliberations of Congress. Political writers are almost unanimous in the opinion that for the safe and thorough discussion of public measures, it is indispensable to have the deliberative body pretty equally divided between opposing parties, whose zeal in advocating or resisting specific acts of legislation will be sure to throw the largest volume of light upon the topic considered. There are others who recognize in the rigidity of party discipline reasons to apprehend that the light thus elicited has no chance to act upon the result of the debate, which, whatever the reasoning on the two sides, is finally decided by their numerical strength. The present extra session of Congress will do much to clear up this matter. There is practically only one party in Congress. Whatever measures are reported by the Committees proceed to a vote without discussion, and are accepted by a majority, which is almost tantamount to unanimity. Measures which involve millions of men and money, which inaugurate or abolish systems of revenue and administration, which create armies and navies, and give to the Executive the plenary powers requisite in such grand National emergencies, are hastened from the committee-room to the engrossing clerk with a rapidity which, in ordinary time, would suggest the idea of the Legislature having surrendered all but the formal exercise of its constitutional functions.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Congress and its Legislation', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Congress and its Legislation', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56c8a428-bc70-5ebc-90d3-ff28e6ed3973,845,nyt://article/56c8a428-bc70-5ebc-90d3-ff28e6ed3973,

First, that a mortgage dated in 1816 was still unsatisfied of record: Since the service of the motion papers, however, that mortgage has been satisfied, but the purchaser still objected to take title, on account of his having lost an opportunity to get a lessee for the premises on account of the mortgage being in the way. The second objection was that the personal representatives, said Chessman & Brown, surviving executors of Robert Brown, deceased, who held a further mortgage upon the property, were not made parties in the partition suit, it being contended that prima facie the mortgage belonged to said Chessman & Brown, individually, and not to the estate of which they were executors, and that the purchaser was entitled to have this title perfect upon the record. On the part of the plaintiff it was contended that the mortgage of 1816 must be presumed to have been paid, after the lapse of twenty years.

There is too much truth in the complaint that Arizona has been neglected by the General Government relative to the great question of Slavery, now in issue between the North and the South. Our entire frontier regions, from the British possessions to Mexico, feel but little real interest, as the practical application of the system of slave labor in all that immense extent of territory is know into be impossible. The universal disloyalty to the Government of the United States manifested on our frontiers must be attributed mainly to the entire want of anything like genuine interest or sympathy on the part of our Government for emigrants or pioneers. The great interests of our widely-extended frontier regions have been left in the hands of the army and of the Indian Agencies, who have too generally prostituted their official position and power to their own selfish purposes, regardless of the general interests of the country and the special welfare of those of our hardy pioneers who pave the way to empire.

A general belief, confirmed by statistical tables of mortality, is that the destruction of armies is in an inverse ratio with the progress in the science of war, and that the more perfect the weapons used by the soldiers, the smaller the losses.

But there is no reason for this astonishment. The appointment is quite in order, and in entire accordance with well-established ecelesiastical precedent. The history of the dark ages is illuminated with many instances in which the professed apostles of Him, the meek and lowly, whose kingdom was not of this world, sought upon the battle-field that excitement and distinction which they could not obtain in the cloister; and shall the shining example of these venerable fathers not be followed by prelates in like circumstances now-a-days? True, the practice was productive of some inconvenience. There was the English bishop, of whom WALTER SCOTT tells us, who, in an interview with a royal envoy, being robed in his pontifical investments, laid his hand solemnly upon his breast as he asseverated ""upon his conscience"" that he had taken no part in a certain very recent skirmish. But the self-imposition of the Episcopal hand produced such a clash of breast-plate, gorget and vantbrace underneath the robes of peace, that the Envoy at once exclaimed, ""My Lord, I fear your conscience clatters."" Then there was the Bishop of Beauvais, whom RICHARD the lion-hearted, encountered among other captains, in his last war upon PHILIP of France, armed cap-a-pie, leading a division of the French forces against him, and whom, with a sacrilegious disregard of his holy office, the royal crusader did most thoroughly beat and take prisoner. Then was Pope CELESTIN wrathful, and demanded the liberty of the prelate, whom he claimed as his spiritual son, threatening direful things if he were not immediately restored to the paternal embrace. But, in reply, RICHARD, all of whose wit was not in his big battle-axe, sent to his Holiness the coat of mail which the bishop had worn in battle, and which was all besmeared with blood as Joseph's coat was; and the King said to the Pope, in the terms used by Joseph's brothers to their father: ""This have we found; know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.""' This, in the lawyer's phrase, concluded the pontiff; and if he imitated the patriarchal recognition of the bloody garment, the fact is not recorded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Right Reverend General Polk.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Right Reverend General Polk.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5658b9ed-0b4e-5f9f-accd-caa23a76157a,1125,nyt://article/5658b9ed-0b4e-5f9f-accd-caa23a76157a,

The storm seems to have been most destructive to buildings and town property at Freeport and Rockford, in which places the aggregate damage is put at not less than $150,000.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TORNADO IN ILLINOIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TORNADO IN ILLINOIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78112294-ae97-521d-ad66-3a8c0f089ed3,382,nyt://article/78112294-ae97-521d-ad66-3a8c0f089ed3,

"Several months ago, it will be recollected that the brig Wm. R. Kibby was picked up by a United States vessel off the coast of Cuba, having on board three negro boys, the remnants of a cargo of slaves that had evidently been just landed on the coast. The boys were brought to this City, where they excited considerable attention, and were the occasion of the famous assault of Capt. RYNDERS -- then, unhappily, Marshal of this District -- upon LEWIS TAPPAN, who had called upon the Marshall to make inquiries about the juvenile Africans. The boys have since been sent back to Africa by the Colonization Society, but their captors -- the officers and crew of the bark Wm. R. Kibby -- have hitherto not bean heard of since their desertion of their craft on the coast of Cuba, until their arrest by the United States Marshal on Thursday afternoon. The Wm. R. Kibby sailed from the port on the 20th of February, 1860, having escaped, as many had doubtless done before her, the extra-ordinary vigilance of Marshal RYNDERS, and immediately proceeded to the coast of Africa, where, after being several times suspected and overhauled by United States vessels on that station, she succeeded in making her escape with a cargo of 500 Africans, which she landed, as before mentioned, on the coast of Cuba -- overlooking, in the hurry of the landing, the three infantile contrabands which had stowed themselves away in the hold. The captain of this successful slave-cruiser was THOMAS H. BURNS, an American, hailing from New-Orleans, where, as appears from an inspection of his baggage since his arrest, he keeps a respectable bank account. Marshal MURRAY has been on the look-out for him for five weeks past, and on Thursday he succeeded in catching him in Wall-street.

The loss of the enemy is reported to be severe, while ours was very small -- a fact probably attributable to the superiority of our artillery. The other battle was fought on Thursday afternoon, two miles east of Roaring River, in Randolph County. The rebels, numbering about two thousand, under command of Col. PEGRAM, were strongly intrenched. Gen. ROSENCRANZ had under his command portions of the Eighth, Tenth and Thirteenth Indiana, and the Nineteenth Ohio Regiments. He made a difficult march of seven or eight miles from Roaring River, cutting a road through the woods, and succeeded in surrounding the enemy, when a desperate fight took place, lasting about an hour and a half, and resulting in the total rout of the rebels, who left behind them six cannon, a large number of horses, wagons, camp equipage, etc., and lost sixty killed and a large number wounded and taken prisoners, the latter including several officers.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/14/archives/new-jersey.html,,"PROBABLE MURDER IN JERSEY CITY. -- About 11 o'clock, on Friday night, an affray occurred at a larger-bier saloon, No.150 Prospect-street, Jersey City, during which the proprietor, WILLIAN BUSH received induries at the hands of half a dozen sailors, belonging to an English vessel, which will undoubtedly terminate fatally. It appears that the men went into the saloon, and after taking drinks, refused to pay for them. BUSH attempted to turn them out, when he was attacked, and fearing serious bodily harm, went behind the counter and took down a sabre, with which to defend himself. He was immediately overpowered; and one of the men, gaining possession of the sabre, attempted to run him through, but BUSH avoided the blow. They then got him down and jumped several times upon his chest, also beat and choked him. They then went away, and subsequently three of them were arrested by Officer SLOAN, and taken to the Station-house. BUSH went down and made a complaint, but on returning was suddenly prostrated, and experienced great pain in the chest and neck. Dr. STRYKER, assisted by Dr. BOUTON, attended the injured man, and found him suffering severely from internal injuries, to such an extent that they were of the opinion that he could not survive many hours. This (Saturday) forenoon Recorder MARTINDALE took BUSH's deposition, which was in substance as above stated. It was only by the greatest effort and the assistance of stimulants that he was able to give a disconnected statement of the affair. The prisoners, who gave their names as JOHN MCCLENNEN, FRANK REYNOLDS and JAMES EDWARDS, were committed to prison by the Recorder, to await result of the injuries.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New Jersey.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New Jersey.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23617ddc-f97e-5da8-8ddd-0914f8f27d34,460,nyt://article/23617ddc-f97e-5da8-8ddd-0914f8f27d34,

The ordinance in that case requires that all keepers of swine should have the express warrant of the Mayor or City Inspector. Mayor TIEMANN then filled the civic chair, and as he could not be induced to soil his robe of office with the filth of swine, the ordinance at that time was enforced with little difficulty. Supported by a force of policemen, the City inspector compelled the pig-owners to remove their piggeries, while those who showed a refractory spirit were dealt with in a summary way. The matter excited much comment at the time, and it was hoped that the evil was permanently abated. But a new King arose in Egypt, and in him the keepers of swine have found a friend. In view of the intensely hot weather, the Sanitary Police have been diligently looking up the filthy and health-destroying objects of the City, and prominently among their reports we find mentioned the hog-pens which abound in the Nineteenth, Twenty-first and Twenty-second Wards. The number of these so far reported is from sixty to seventy, with from three to fifteen hogs in each. Any one who is familiar with the habits of the animal, may fancy that five or six hundred hogs are no desirable addition to the live stock of a limited territory. The huts in which the owners live are little superior to the stys. and before each of them a cauldron is stationed, which receives the garbage obtained from gutters and swillpails, and this reeking mass is kept boiling for hours daily. The exhalations from this villainous mixture cannot be described, but the atmosphere is infected by them for blocks around. Hogs are proverbially unclean, but the horrid, putrid filth in which these hogs revel must be be seen to be believed. On the representations of the Sanitary Police, the Magistrates issued summonses within a few days past to all the parties implicated, requiring them to appear for examination on the charge of having violated the City Ordinance concerning the keeping of swine. This action of the Justices fell like a thunderbolt among the dismayed swineherds, but after obtaining the advice of ""distinguished counsel,"" they rushed to Mayor WOOD and obtained from him a permit to keep swine, in number unlimited and in filth incomparable. Thus protected they answered the summonses, and of course were acquitted. The Mayor in this matter, may be doubtless actuated by a desire to become a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to those who do well, but the Police Commissioners and the Sanitary Squad do not see it in that light.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/515187a5-9178-515c-88c9-41218660ec99,1702,nyt://article/515187a5-9178-515c-88c9-41218660ec99,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/14/archives/light-and-durable-cannon.html,,"The fact that the Government is understood to have ordered six hundred wrought-iron rifled cannon -- a number not exceeded in any European field armament -- is satisfactory evidence that it appreciates what must be, in modern warfare, the strong arm of assault and defence. But it is unfortunate, for several reasons, that such an immense order was given to one Pennsylvania house. First, wrought-iron is acknowledged by all military authorities to be vastly inferior to steel as a cannon metal; second, ""built-up"" cannon, besides being quite as expensive, by reason of the extra amount of labor required, as solid cast-steel guns, are, and must be, from the nature and state of the art less sound, on the average, than guns made of one homogeneous piece. The whole history of failure in wrought structures, made of tolerable and average materials, is simply a history of bad welds, either in the pile from which the forging was made, or in the junction of the several parts of the completed work. This is a cardinal fact in iron-working, which no practitioner will attempt to deny, and which is so simple and well known as to be patent to the public at large. It is true that blacksmiths, with careful heats and manipulations, and hammers ten or twenty times heavier than ordinary trip-hammers, in proportion to the work, can generally make sound welds; but welding large masses, under the comparatively light pressure of common hammers and rolls, is universally distrusted and avoided as far as may be, while an excess of size is always given to large welded parts which are subjected to great strain. Not one-tenth part of railway bars are as sound in the weld as through the homogeneous parts, which accounts for their rapid destruction by lamination and peeling. In designing wrought iron work, the good engineer avoids welds in light working parts whenever he can, and in locomotive and steamboat practice, he frequently goes to the expense of bronze castings, the best of which will average as strong as wrought iron, and even prefers iron castings, in some cases, to welds. And in making large forgings, the great modern improvement has been the reduction of the number of pieces in the pile from which the forging is made, by increasing the size of the slabs forming the pile, and the use of heavier rolls and hammers, chiefly for the purpose of reducing the number of welds and increasing the soundness of those that cannot be avoided. If this is the practice under ordinary strains, what are the risks of welds under the terrific and instantaneous force of gun-powder?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Light and Durable Cannon.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Light and Durable Cannon.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6189f5ff-edc1-523d-aad8-4a04f0a4a950,1454,nyt://article/6189f5ff-edc1-523d-aad8-4a04f0a4a950,

It was at the special request of Gen. SCOTT that Col. MCREYNOLDS was appointed to the command. Seven of the twelve companies of the regiment have been raised in this City, and as they are officered by experienced military men. New-York will expect much from them. A more respectable-looking body of men than have enrolled their names in the Lincoln Cavalry have not left this City. During the weary weeks of delay they have devoted themselves attentively to drill, and are not only well posted in company evolutions, but have become quite expert with the sabre. After being mustered into service, they will go into camp near the City to await their arms and uniforms. The three Pennsylvania and two Ohio companies have already been mustered in and are in camp. The entire regiment will, by order of the War Department, be in Washington within ten days.

"The rebels are utterly discomfited in Western Virginia -- their position is such as to render it extremely improbable that they will venture another battle, unless they are driven to it.

Thereupon Mr. RUSSELL published, a card in the Mobile Register, denying that any artist was traveling with him in behalf of Harper's Weekly, whereupon the proprietors of the latter journal, to justify themselves from the charge of misrepresenting their business arrangements to the public, reiterated the assertion, and continued to publish sketches ""taken by our special artist, traveling in company with W.H.

Into these out-of-the way places, quantities of provisions, it is believed, are nightly introduced, and after being transported over the peninsula of Eastern Virginia and Maryland, are conveyed across the Chesapeake in some of the innumerable pongys which abound in the rivers on the opposite shore.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HOW THE REBELS GET THEIR FOOD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HOW THE REBELS GET THEIR FOOD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2eb740e2-6bfd-5e50-8681-c216491a58ba,277,nyt://article/2eb740e2-6bfd-5e50-8681-c216491a58ba,

"Upon the English statute books are a great number of laws once in harmony with the spirit of the times, and in full force, but which, upon changes in public sentiment and in the structure of society, have long since been practically, though not formally, repealed. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/15/archives/treason-no-longer-a-crime.html,,"Upon the English statute books are a great number of laws once in harmony with the spirit of the times, and in full force, but which, upon changes in public sentiment and in the structure of society, have long since been practically, though not formally, repealed. The habiliments of a previous generation no longer fit the present, and they are hung up in some out-of-the-way closet, awaiting a possible contingency, instead of being thrown to the clothes-gatherer or rag-man. The United States are a young people, yet old enough to have outgrown, in the same way, laws inherited from our English ancestry, and which still have a conspicuous place in our Constitution and codes of law. Among these obsolete laws is that against Treason. Under the old English Constitution, from which our own was borrowed, the laws against treason were cruel and sanguinary, and in the hands of the Courts, backed as they usually were by compliant juries, were instruments by which the head of every person obnoxious to the Crown could be easily brought to the block. We admit that rulers in olden times were compelled to carry a firm hand. Society had not been learned that as a general rule, the greater the freedom the more perfect the public order. In popular idea, the Government was the State, and to conspire against one was to conspire against the other. In the safety and security of the former was that of the latter. In the safety of the King was the salvation of the people. For a conspiracy against the former, no punishment could be too severe. In olden times, treason was the more severely dealt with, because it was an attack upon private as well as public rights. Then the power to govern exercised, was not by virtue of popular appointment, but as a matter of prescriptive right. Treason was thus a conspiracy against persons as well as the State, and the law against it was pursued with all the energy with which a man defends himself from a personal assault. But England has grown more lenient and humane. Treason there is rarely plotted. The Tower is the show-place for the curious relics of the middle ages, no longer the pen for the suspected or convicted. Government has nothing to fear from Treason, and when fears are not aroused, punishments are never cruel or excessive.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Treason no Longer a Crime.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Treason no Longer a Crime.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/70ef5700-e632-5c16-80cf-dea7d9bc3283,1191,nyt://article/70ef5700-e632-5c16-80cf-dea7d9bc3283,

"Thomas Galway et al. vs. The United States Steam Sugar Refining Company et al. -- This case was fully stated in the TIMES of July [???] The plaintiffs obtained an injunction restraining the defendants from making any confession of judgment, and from any alienation of the property of the company. He also obtained an injunction restraining all creditors from commencing any action against the Company, together with an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed. These injunctions and the order to show cause were obtained upon the allegation that the Company was insolvent, and would not go into voluntary dissolution, and that about half of the indebtedness matured on the 14th of June last, and the creditors to that amount were about commencing suits. Upon the return to the order to show cause the defendants denied all the allegations of the plaintiffs that they, the defendants, had made any attempts to prefer creditors.

"Our correspondent at Havana announces the arrival at Cienfuegos of the Sumler, a steamer of the rebel Navy, bringing six prizes, the results of a short predatory cruise. A seventh had been burned at sea. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/15/archives/privateering-and-pickens.html,,"Our correspondent at Havana announces the arrival at Cienfuegos of the Sumler, a steamer of the rebel Navy, bringing six prizes, the results of a short predatory cruise. A seventh had been burned at sea. This Sumter was in other times a mail steamer plying between Havana and New-Orleans, with the title, Habana; but seized by the rebel government, she was converted into a man-of-war, and well-armed and manned, put to sea the other day from New-Orleans, in saucy defiance of what the journals of that city properly describe as the paper blockade. The news of her departure has barely reached us when it is hotly pursued by this later news of her success. It is true the insular authorities have reclaimed the six prizes, because they had been captured within Spanish waters; but the fact of seizure shows the power for mischief possessed by the cruiser in question, and renders it almost certain that if any of these released vessels hereafter depart for their ports of destination in the United States, they will be exposed to serious danger of recapture and condemnation. Moreover, the Sumter, sailing from Cienfuegos has doubtless placed herself in the path of the Aspinwall steamers, with their millions of California treasure. Much pains have been taken by the steamship company to put their packets in a thoroughly defensible condition; and it is possible they may be able to contend successfully against privateers. But the Sumter, according to the New-Orleans papers, is far more perfectly armed and equipped than any privateer; and if the treasure ship crosses its track, the odds are fearfully against an escape. These facts and dangers are the first fruits of the laxity with which the blockade is enforced at the mouth of the Mississippi.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Privateering and Pickens', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Privateering and Pickens', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e34d75b-1c36-5808-9cb5-dbe1cc9ffc63,914,nyt://article/7e34d75b-1c36-5808-9cb5-dbe1cc9ffc63,

"There is great difficulty in dealing with a people who are children in intelligence, and barbarians in the excess of their conceit. There is no schoolmaster in such case but a thorough drubbing. The most astonishing arrogance and exalted notions of their power led the Confederates into rebellion. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/16/archives/confederate-finances-and-folly.html,,"There is great difficulty in dealing with a people who are children in intelligence, and barbarians in the excess of their conceit. There is no schoolmaster in such case but a thorough drubbing. The most astonishing arrogance and exalted notions of their power led the Confederates into rebellion. Every hypothesis upon which success was to be realized has utterly and totally failed, yet they are as stark mad as ever. The divisions at the North were to secure an easy victory. The North is an unit, moving with tremendous energy and power. The war was to be on Northern soil. Not a single Confederate has dared to show his face on. Northern soil. They are scattered like sheep when attacked on their own. One ""Southron"" could flog five Yankees. Col. SIEGEL's command in Missouri has shown that one United States soldier is a match for five rebels. England and France were to eagerly recognize their independence and open Southern ports. They refuse to do either. To support the war a loan of $15,000,000 was brought out with great flourish of trumpets, based on an export duty on cotton. Nothing could equal, in the opinion of the Confederates, the excellence of such a security. Some forced loans were made upon it, but, according to Mr. RUSSELL, of the London Times, they are now worth only 10 or 15 cents on the dollar in New-Orleans. In three months more they will not be worth as many mills. The whole thing has utterly collapsed. The cotton which was to be taxed to pay the interest and principal of the loan, is not going forward without the consent of the Government they are seeking to destroy. When this loan could no longer be forced, another of $50,000,000, based on some other kind of moonshine, was brought out, but never heard of after the first announcement. In the meantime Confederate soldiers were unpaid, badly clothed and armed, and, as a necessary consequence, disorderly and discontented. Some new system must be thought of, or the rebellion was at an end. The South had no money -- in fact, it never had any except in a return for the crop, which was always anticipated. In this dilemma the Confederates have come to the last resort of all barbarous people, which is, to contribute a portion of what each one raises to the support of the war. Indians, in such case, contribute wampum and beaver skins, -- the South, raw cotton. By the ""spontaneous enthusiasm"" of the people, the Confederate Government is to become possessed of one-half of the coming crop, say 1,500,000 bales, worth 875,000,000. This is to be offered to England and France at very low prices, provided they will raise the blockade. The South is completely electrified with this new scheme, which owes its paternity, we believe, to the illustrious Mr. COBB. Mr. Vice-President STEPHENS is now stumping the State of Georgia in its behalf, with such success, the Southern papers tell, as bids fair to secure the whole amount called for The planters of Louisiana have caught the infection and are subscribing sugar; those of the low districts of South Carolina, rice. All is to go, Mormon fashion, to the Government, which is to become a colossal broker -- is to send it all to Europe, not a pound to the United Statesbring home oceans of money, with which to drive back the perfidious Yankees to their inhospitable homes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Confederate Finances and Folly.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Confederate Finances and Folly.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6f3cc0f2-f3cf-5ba7-ab8d-e4c82f7a094e,1022,nyt://article/6f3cc0f2-f3cf-5ba7-ab8d-e4c82f7a094e,

"THE MURDEROUS AFFRAY ON BOARD THE STEAMBOAT DANIEL DREW. -- PHILIP ELMENDORF, the captain of the steamboat Daniel Drew , ALONZO COLYER, the clerk, and two or three others belonging to the vessel, appeared, yesterday, before Justice KELLY, at the Tombs, in reference to the charges pending against them, of having feloniously assaulted Lieut. TIMOTHY DONOHUE, and three privates of the 36th Regiment, on the trip from Newburgh to New-York, last Friday. The substance of the complaint has been already published in the TIMES. The Lieutenant, who is a native of Newburgh, got on board the boat at that place, having three men under his care, who were on their way to join their Regiment, now stationed at Washington. Before the boat arrived at West Point, a difficulty occurred between Lieut. DONOHUE and the officers, regarding the payment of the fare, but its precise nature has not yet become known. The dispute resulted in an assault upon the soldiers, all of whom were brutally mauled with handspikes by the employes of the boat, and at West Point they were set on shore. Soon afterwards the attention of the officers of the military academy was attracted to their helpless condition, and after having received information respecting the merits of the case, a telegram was dispatched to Superintendent KENNEDY calling for the arrest of the Drew's officers and crew. This was done, and on Saturday afternoon the three privates were sent down from west Point -- and, upon their affidavits, Capt. ELMENDORF, Mr. COLYER and the others were required to give bail to answer at the General Sessions. Lieut. DONOHUE, who had been placed in the hospital at West Point, was found to be in too weak a state to admit of his removal to the City, and Justice KELLY has received letters from the physicians having charge of him, dated last Sunday, stating that his skull is fractured, and that the chances against his recovery are five to one. Under these circumstances the examination of witnesses was not taken up yesterday, the counsel for the prisoners preferring to await the result of DONOHUE's injuries. It is said that the excitement which the affair has occasioned at Newburgh is very great. DONOHUE is well known and much respected there, and his friends declare vengeance upon the officers of the boat. On her trip to Albany on Saturday morning, it was deemed inadvisable to land there, as a threatening crowd of from three to four thousand had assembled at the pier, and the passengers for that place were transferred to the Armenia, which conveyed them to their destination.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/16/archives/general-city-news.html,,"THE MURDEROUS AFFRAY ON BOARD THE STEAMBOAT DANIEL DREW. -- PHILIP ELMENDORF, the captain of the steamboat Daniel Drew , ALONZO COLYER, the clerk, and two or three others belonging to the vessel, appeared, yesterday, before Justice KELLY, at the Tombs, in reference to the charges pending against them, of having feloniously assaulted Lieut.

"Hon. NATHAN APPLETON, who died in Boston on July 14, was born in Ipswich, N.H., on Oct. 6, 1779.

"We give elsewhere the new Tariff bill now before Congress. It is simply a war measure, and differs from the preceding Tariff chiefly by taking tea and coffee from the free list, and increasing largely the duties on luxuries, such as distilled liquors, wines, sugars and segars. The duty on salt is largely increased. Black teas are to the taxed at the rate of ten cents per pound, green fifteen and coffee five cents. The duties on wines and distilled liquors are increased fifty per cent.; on cigars, very nearly in the same ratio. On sugars the duties are increased from three-fourths of a cent, to two and a half cents per pound on raw; to three cents on clayed, and four cents on white and refined. Molasses pays six cents per gallon instead of two. White lead $2 25 per 100 pounds instead of $1 25. There is some increase on other unimportant articles, but not enough to add materially to the revenue. In textile fabrics there is little change. A slight reduction is made on iron and steel -- the duty on merchant bar being reduced from $15 to $15 per ton; on railroad iron from $12 to $10 per ton. As the previous duties were nearly, if not quite prohibitory, this reduction is for the benifit of the revenue. With the exceptions named, the Morrill Tariff remains substantially untouched. It was not to be expected that Congress, at its present session, would undertake a revision of our system, or make any change that did not promise to add largely to the revenue. It did not assemble nor had it time for such objects. The long and regular session commences in a little over four months, when, there will be ample opportunity for deliberation. At the present moment the country trails for action, and will undoubtedly heartily respond to any measure that will provide the means for putting down the great rebellion, even at the cost of a heavy tax upon luxuries which, for a generation almost, were duty free. We are for several years, at least, to have an expensive Government, and we must follow in the wake of the nations of the Old World, who not only have no source of revenue untaxed, but who leave ascertained by experience the kinds of taxation which will produce the largest revenue. Taxes may be increased to almost any extent when paid in small sums, and which are daily and hourly levied. England finds no difficulty in raising annually $100,000,000 by duties on tea, coffee, sugar and tobacco; and $85,000,000 by an excise duty on malt and distilled liquors. They are paid in uniform sums every day in the year, and in such trifling amounts each time that the burden is only slightly felt.

Mr. BROWN was born in Bradford, England, where he lived until his eleventh year, at which time he came, with his parents, to this City. He was soon engaged in the old Tontine Coffee House, where he remained for a long time, and became very popular with the patrons of that once favorite house. Subsequently, he was engaged in Lovejoy's Hotel, and afterward, having acquired an enviable reputation as a business man, became associated with Mr. HOWARD, a junior proprietor of Tammany Hotel. When Mr. HOWARD retired from business he left the proprietorship with Mr. BROWN, who continued in that position until the time of his death. His anxiety for the comfort of his patrons, many of whom had known him for years, led him to over exertion, which, it is believed, brought on the disease of which he died. He was forty-five years of ago, and leaves a wife and eight children, the oldest of whom is the wife of Mr. CHAS. WALKE, of the Seventh Regiment. Mr. BROWN was a member of Manhattan Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons; of the Order of Odd Fellows,and also of the Veteran Corps of the Twelfth Regiment, Independence Guard. Few men die leaving more warm personal friends behind them. The funeral will take place from his residence, on Thursday, at 3 P.M. The hotel will for the present be managed by Mr. ERASTUS JOHNSON, who has long and efficiently been the chief officer of the hotel.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6bdaff67-be44-50a7-b8c0-5ac7d3446637,1813,nyt://article/6bdaff67-be44-50a7-b8c0-5ac7d3446637,

"As the question is frequently asked, who is MRS.

She has especially studied the constitution and wants of this numerous class, so generally overlooked or carelessly treated by the faculty in too many instances; and, as a result of this effort, and practical knowledge obtained in a lifetime spent of nurse and physician, she has compounded a Soothing Syrup for children teething. It operates like magic -- giving rest and health, and is, moreover, sure to regulate the bowels. In consequence of this article, Mrs. Winslow is becoming world-renowned as a benefactor of her race; children do certainly RISE UP and bless her, especially is this the case in this City.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/18/archives/food-for-the-soldiers.html,,"All experiene shows that sudden changes in the habits of life, whether as it regards the article of food, colthing or exercise, as well as climate, operate directly upon the physical health of those who may be subjected to them. Hence the danger to raw recruits entering upon the active duties of a campaign. Most of them are unaccustomed to severe labor, and scarcely any of them are used to long marches, or such work as is required in throwing up intrenchments or constructing fortified camps. Drilling in hot weather is, of itself, severe labor, in fact, camp life is, in its generalities, a total change of physical habits and employment to almost every one of the many thousand volunteers now in the service of the country. The ordinary rations dealt out to the soldiers are altogether different from the food to which they have been accustomed, and are in some respects selected without any reference to those sanitary rules, which every decently read physician would prescribe for the promotion of health. For instance, fat salt-pork and bacon are the leading articles, the great staples of Army rations, and that in a hot climate, and in midsummer, with the mercury ranging daily from 90° to 100° in the shade. Of these, together with bread, there is an abundance, but what number of the volunteers have been accustomed at their homes to have pork and bacon the staple of their daily food? probably not one in ten. Of vegetables, such as potatoes, onions, or cabbages, the soldiers are said to have scarcely any at all, and yet these, outside of the Army, are regarded as absolutely indispensable to the tables of all classes. Fresh meats are not mentioned among the regular rations, and yet probably eight of every ten soldiers have been accustomed to them every day during their whole lives. Without pursuing the subject further, it is perhaps sufficient to say, that a greater change in the food of the soldier could scarcely be made, than that which the recruit experiences on entering upon his military career. This should not be so, if it can be avoided, and we confess to an inability to see a necessity for it. In the matter of economy, we suppose that fresh meats are as cheap as salt pork and bacon, and can be quite as easily secured to an extent at least that will render a healthful variety to the soldier's fare. We suppose, too, that fresh vegetables, such as potatoes, onions and cabbaged, can easily be supplied, and their cheapness ordinarily would render such supply a measure of economy. In fact, the soldiers' food should be of that plain and substantial kind, and assimilating as nearly as possible to that which the men who compose our armies are accustomed to at home. We know that this cannot always be accomplished; but, though difficult in some localities, and under some circumstances impossible, yet much may be done in these respects to soften the hardships of the soldier's life, and render move agreeable the performance of the arduous duties which from a sense of patriotism they have taken upon themselves. A good supply of vegetables, such as potatoes, onions and cabbages, should always be furnished. Fresh meat, if possible, should be supplied five or six times a week. These, with the addition of corn meal and molasses occasionally, would afford a pleasant variety to the monotony of Army rations, and afford a relish for the soldier's food that would at once make them contented, and give them health and strength for the weary marches and hard-fought battles that are before them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Food for the Soldiers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Food for the Soldiers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/137249b1-8f4a-52c5-b9f0-4b24281e014a,757,nyt://article/137249b1-8f4a-52c5-b9f0-4b24281e014a,

The prisoners were lodged at the Central Station during the night, and early this morning they will be convoyed to Fort Delaware. The prisoners were young men, Virginians. They were captured by the Third Pennsylvania Regiment while on picket duty. Three of them belong to the cavalry and two to the infantry, and all represent, that they entered the service on a lark. The issue does not suit them, judging from their rueful countenance last evening while in a cell at the station house. They were taken prisoners on Sunday week, and left Martinsburgh, in charge of the guard, on Saturday. Their uniforms have been taken from their persons and exchanged for citizen's dress. Not a syllable has passed their lips since their capture regarding secession or State frights, and it does not appear that they have a very clear idea of the principles involved in the present struggle.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL PRISONERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBEL PRISONERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/462f04a9-a289-5d87-8a5b-1ebb4522fedc,623,nyt://article/462f04a9-a289-5d87-8a5b-1ebb4522fedc,

The recent riotous proceedings at St. Johns occurred at a time when we were all so absorbed in our own momentous affairs that they attracted but little of our attention. But the fact is, that the British Government has narrowly escaped having to deal with an insurrection in the great fishing colony as formidable, in its relative proportions, as that with which we are now coping, and very similar to it in its spirit and purpose. Our readers will remember that the Lieutenant-Governor, BANNERMAN, of Newfoundland, was prevented by a mob from opening the Legislature at St. Johns, that houses of obnoxious persons were destroyed, they themselves attacked, and order only restored by the sending of troops from Halifax, who fired upon the rioters, killing innocent people, (as is usual in such cases,) and thereby inflaming passion, although they repressed violence. The agitation is but repressed, not allayed; and it is more than probable that the home Government, considering the disturbed condition of this country, and being possessed of that extraordinary notion prevalent in England, that the United States desires to provoke a war with Great Britain and to foment trouble in the Provinces, has sent these regiments with an eye to a possible need of their services in Newfoundland.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Parallel.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Parallel.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/588f0b23-54b1-55e7-b824-2afbb618fd38,734,nyt://article/588f0b23-54b1-55e7-b824-2afbb618fd38,

In Perth Amboy there are a large number of open and blatant sympathizers with the Southern movement, who make their head-quarters at a well-known hotel in that town, and lose no opportunity to vilify and outrage the cause of liberty and its supporters. On Monday an estimable and elderly citizen of that place, Dr. PALMER, was assaulted in the public street by a fellow named ALBERT COMPTON, and after a few words was thrown violently upon the pavement. It seems that a short time since a relative of COMPTON made use of some infelicitous expression of opprobrium concerning the American flag, and Dr. PALMER, fearing she would incur the displeasure and, possibly, ill-treatment from those in the vicinity, justly remonstrated with, and rebuked her. For this, and without notice, COMPTON, taking the law into his own hands, outraged publicly and violently an old and defenceless man. It looks to us as though Mr. COMPTON and all fellows of kindred tastes should receive the early attentions of a Vigilance Committee.

Mr. Rasquin's attorneys disregarded this settlement, claiming that the defendants had combined with the plaintiff, who they alleged was irresponsible to deprive them of their costs. A motion was then made on behalf of the Company to have the action discontinued, which was denied by the Court, whereupon the defendants appealed to the General Term.

Mr. and Mrs. FLORENCE, who come to us as regularly as the dog days, have assumed the management of the establishment, and intend during the coming six weeks to produce several novelties of a patriotic character. Beyond placing the fact of their arrival, with a hint concerning their intentions, on record, it is not necessary to say more. Neither the drama of ""Handy Andy"" nor the protean farce called ""A Lesson for Husbands,"" invite, by their merits or performance, a particular consideration. They are, moreover, somewhat stale. In the first piece Mr. FLORENCE made his appearance, and was warmly applauded. He is one of the most genial and amusing Irishmen now on the stage.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/19/archives/the-great-cotton-loan.html,,"We have previously referred to the novel, as well as vast movement, going on at the South to retrieve the already dilapidated finances of the Confederate Government. Money it has none. In credit it is equally out at the elbows. Such repudiators as JEFF DAVIS, with, all their impudence, cannot show their faces in any money market in the world. Borrowing is out of the question. But 100,000 men in the field are not to be fed on chaff. They may enlist in a frenzy, and serve for a month or so from the same impulse. But patriotism is only supported by a well-stocked larder and prompt pay. Without these, a large mass of men, nominally soldiers, are no better than a mob. This the leaders of the rebellion cannot but feel. But every ordinary source of raising money has been tried and has failed. The proceeds of the last crop, unfortunately, was spent before war commenced. The only possible alternative, consequently, was in some way or another to make the coming one available. But this the planter could not do. He had no possible means of sending it to market. All the avenues thither were held by the perfidious Yankees. In this dilemma, Mr. COBB, late Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, hit upon the following happy expedient: That each planter should sell at least one-half of his crop to the Confederate Government, taking for his pay its 8 per cent. bonds, ""good as gold."" In this way, the planter would get a round price for his crop, while the Confederates would be put in possession of ample means whereby to chastise Northern barbarians. The plan was exactly suited to Southern fancy, and the Vice-President of the Confederates and a large number of his most distinguished confreres are canvassing their constituents in its behalf, with great success.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Cotton Loan.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Cotton Loan.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b82d1df-e815-5455-a0df-a07df7d1dbed,1115,nyt://article/2b82d1df-e815-5455-a0df-a07df7d1dbed,

"Yesterday, in some thousands of places, and with every variety of observance, was celebrated the Anniversary of American Independence. It was proposed throughout the Union to keep the day with more than usual solemnity, and to take occasion for making a display of patriotic feeling suited to the present crisis. That this has been done not only across the Atlantic, but wherever throughout the Old World a dozen Americans could come together, is a matter of course. Fireworks have blazed, cannon have been discharged, the streets have resounded with the noise of rifles and revolvers, the exuberant feelings of the American youth have vented themselves in shouts and songs; while those who prefer a more intellectual pastime have made or listened to political harangues by the hour. What torrents of eloquence must have been poured out during the last day and night! An ordinary 4th of July is not to be easily surpassed, but we may conclude that this of 1861 will have preeminence over any of the 84 which have gone before it.

It was proposed throughout the Union to keep the day with more than usual solemnity, and to take occasion for making a display of patriotic feeling suited to the present crisis. That this has been done not only across the Atlantic, but wherever throughout the Old World a dozen Americans could come together, is a matter of course. Fireworks have blazed, cannon have been discharged, the streets have resounded with the noise of rifles and revolvers, the exuberant feelings of the American youth have vented themselves in shouts and songs; while those who prefer a more intellectual pastime have made or listened to political harangues by the hour. What torrents of eloquence must have been poured out during the last day and night! An ordinary 4th of July is not to be easily surpassed, but we may conclude that this of 1861 will have preeminence over any of the 84 which have gone before it. Denunciations launched against the world in general, defiance of whatever designs may lie hid under the neutrality of foreign Powers, will have been mingled with the old rejoicings at the triumph over the British and with the conventional praises of Republican government.

The... ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/19/archives/jersey-city.html,,"SERIOUS CHARGE AGAINST A RAILROAD CONDUCTOR. -- A young man, named THOMAS DOTY, conductor on the New-Jersey--Railroad, was taken before Recorder MARTINDALE, yesterday, on a warrant charging him with having committed an aggravated assault and battery upon one of his passengers. The complainant, FRANCIS CARLAN, a contractor, residing at Bergen, alleges that on the 8th day of July he purchased a ticket at Newark, for a passage to New-York. While on the way, as the conductor came along for the fare, he felt in his pocket for the ticket but at the moment was unable to find it. Accused demanded the ticket or fare, and finally CARLAN gave him twenty-five cents, at the same time saying that he wanted his money returned if he succeeded in finding the ticket. Before the conductor left the car, CARLAN came across the ticket, and handing it over asked for the return of his money, but alleges that both were retained. This led to an altercation, when he alleges DOTY struck him twice, knocking him nearly insensible, inflicting two very severe wounds over the eyes, and, while down, he was kicked by some person in the small of the back. Upon arriving at the junction on Bergen Hill, the cars were stopped, when complainant and a friend, who had interceded to save him and was also struck, were forcibly ejected from the cars by DOTY, assisted by several of the railroad employes. Since that time until Wednesday last CARLAN has been confined to his house, from the injuries sustained. His face still shows indications of very severe blows, there being a large cut over each eye, which the injured man believes to have been made with brass knuckles.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jersey City.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Jersey City.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5d29ea10-4eeb-5a77-b42f-a9cf1eccd994,462,nyt://article/5d29ea10-4eeb-5a77-b42f-a9cf1eccd994,

How many of them will to-day be thinking of that now memorable walk of WASHINGTON's on the bank of the Schuylkill, where he was found thoughtfully pacing the grass, meditating, as he explained at the moment, whether it would not be better to give up the idea of the Union, than to run the risks of such compromises as were found necessary. How many will now openly admit -- what they would never acknowledge to themselves before -- that the Union has never been a sound, honest fact, single in its meaning, and. sincere in its professions! To-day, when Virginia is the seat of civil war, how many Northern men will recall the traditional discontent at the supremacy of that proud State, and the melancholy conviction which always went with it, that the Union depended on that supremacy!

The leading took the form of compromises, so called, which were in fact bribes. The property suffrage of the slave owners was conceded by the Northern States, as a professed equivalent for the larger share of direct taxes borne by the Southern States; and that condition of affairs was established which, in fact, rendered the maintenance of the Union dependent on the supremacy, of the Virginian interest, since extended over half the country, with aggravations which have been found at length intolerable. The issue has been foreseen by other Virginians than WASHINGTON himself. The last of the band of noble Virginians of the revolutionary time, the venerable Chief-Justice MARSHALL, sank into sadness, in his latter years for reasons which he avowed to his friend STORY and others who had his confidence. He said that he saw his own State going to ruin under the desolating influences of Slavery, and that the ruin of Virginia would destroy the Republic.

At the North he was the favorite of a small fragment of the shattered Democracy, whose fealty to party and zeal for its usages were stronger than their allegiance to the Constitution. He represented the extreme of Southern ultraism, and his election was, by coercing the North and West into all the concessions demanded, to avert the threatened ills that were looming in the perspective, or failing in this, he could, if need be, not only hand over his own State to the Southern Confederacy, but even Maryland and the Capitol at Washington, thus severing the Union and throwing all the Border States into the domain of the cotton oligarchy. Mr. DOUGLAS was rejected, because, while he was what the South termed conservative to some extent, yet they regarded him as too deeply imbued with a love for the Union, and too faithful in his allegiance to the Constitution, to serve their purposes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Senator Breckinridge and his Speech in the Senate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Senator Breckinridge and his Speech in the Senate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d5b08a3d-a741-5384-983c-5751e0e6f633,781,nyt://article/d5b08a3d-a741-5384-983c-5751e0e6f633,

The title of this ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/19/archives/the-slaveholders-rebellion.html,,"In the Senate, the other day, a bill was introduced by Mr. POMEROY, and read twice by its title, viz.: ""A bill for the Suppression of the Slaveholder's Rebellion."" The title of this bill was subsequently commented on with some feeling by Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, who maintained that the revolt which the Government is about to exert its entire power to suppress, is not a slaveholder's rebellion, but a movement in which all classes in the Southern States -- non-slaveholders as well as slaveholders -- equally participated. The fact adduced by Mr. BRECKINRIDGE is, in the main, undoubtedly correct. The great rebellion of the South is not confined to the slaveholders, or to any other class, but pervades in some degree, all shades of society, without reference to possessions or occupations. Yet, notwithstanding this indisputable fact, it would be impossible to characterize the wicked insurrection which now prevails in the slaveholding States, more aptly and truly in the brief title of a bill, than by the words which have been employed by the Senator from Kansas, -- THE SLAVEHOLDER's REBELLION. It is, in fact, an insurrection against the peace of society, which had its origin in the especial interest of the slaveholder, and which has been promoted, encouraged and fired, at every step of its progress, under an open demand for the extension of the area of Slavery, and the increase of the political power of the slaveholding class.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Slaveholder's Rebellion"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Slaveholder's Rebellion"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db13f8ef-8c7d-5934-b7e3-25e50064ee4b,1046,nyt://article/db13f8ef-8c7d-5934-b7e3-25e50064ee4b,

"The engagement at Bull Run proves to have been far less important than appeared from the first dispatches. Gen. TYLER was making a reconnoisance in force, when a portion of his brigade was fired into from masked batteries of rifled cannon, stationed in the wood across the creek. The advance was gallantly sustained by Col. RICHARDSON, in command of three companies of the Massachusetts First and SHERMAN's battery. After being relieved by the Michigan Second and the New-York Twelfth, Volunteers, (not Col. BUTTERFIELD's,) the National forces took up a position on a neighboring hill, and planted rifle cannon, supported by Capt. BRACKETT's cavalry, and the troops already named. From this position a steady fire was kept up on both sides until yesterday morning, doing some execution -- accounts differ much as to the loss of either side. Gen. MCDOWELL estimates the loss of killed and wounded at about forty on the National side. Other accounts, however, magnify the numbers considerably. After several hours' firing, the attacking forces retired beyond the range of the rebel batteries, while vigorous preparations were made for flank movements, attacking the secession batteries on all sides. A number of Members of Congress witnessed the engagement, in which about four thousand troops on either side participated. The latest details of the fight yet received by mail, are given in our editorial correspondence this morning. It will be perceived by all accounts that the rebels, as usual, dared not show themselves in force, but kept their usual shelter of ravines and batteries. The latest news from the advance camp, which reaches us in our editorial correspondence via Washington, confirms our impression that the affair at Bull's Run was of minor importance. Gen. MCDOWELL had made thorough arrangements for reconnoitering the enemy's position. One of the rebel batteries was abandoned, and if the others could not be flanked they were to be attacked in front with heavy artillery, of which there was plenty at Gen. MCDOWELL's command. The depredations of our troops excited the greatest indignation among the officers, and steps were taken to punish the offenders. There is every indication of a further advance and severe engagement to-day.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/20/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The engagement at Bull Run proves to have been far less important than appeared from the first dispatches.

It will be perceived by all accounts that the rebels, as usual, dared not show themselves in force, but kept their usual shelter of ravines and batteries. The latest news from the advance camp, which reaches us in our editorial correspondence via Washington, confirms our impression that the affair at Bull's Run was of minor importance. Gen. MCDOWELL had made thorough arrangements for reconnoitering the enemy's position. One of the rebel batteries was abandoned, and if the others could not be flanked they were to be attacked in front with heavy artillery, of which there was plenty at Gen. MCDOWELL's command. The depredations of our troops excited the greatest indignation among the officers, and steps were taken to punish the offenders. There is every indication of a further advance and severe engagement to-day.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/74860a4c-b3f2-5ab0-b355-904de6ef2b73,1143,nyt://article/74860a4c-b3f2-5ab0-b355-904de6ef2b73,

"A most extraordinary statement reaches us through Western Virginia papers, to the effect that a serious fight occurred between the Virginians and Georgians, lately, of Gen.

The Georgians were compelling the rustic Virginians to do all the work in the intrenchments, saying that they were ""gentlemen,"" and did not come to Virginia to dig holes in the ground, but to ""help Virginia out of a land [???]."" The blood of Old Virginia could not brook this arrogance and imposition, and the fight ensued. Many facts incline us to credit this story. It is well known that a deep and general alienation has occurred between Eastern Virginia and their Southern allies, and that reproaches are beginning to fill the papers on both sides. This estrangement would quickly reach the Western camps, and conduct such as is ascribed to the Georgians would ripen it to a collision.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/21/archives/a-warning-to-us.html,,"A recent issue of the Mexican Extraordinary contains a list of the various Govern- ments and Executive officers in Mexico since 1821, when that country achieved its Independence, up to the beginning of the present year, when JUAREZ was chosen Constitutional President. During these forty years, the form of the Mexican Government has been changed from one thing to another, and backwards and forwards, no less than fourteen times; while the Emperors, Presidents, Constitutional Presidents, Military Chiefs, Dictators, Supreme Dictators, and-so-forth, who have administered the various forms of civil polity, have averaged considerably over one per year, and at certain periods have counted up about one a month. After the first and second regencies and the emperorship of ITURBIDE, come in rapid procession the Provisional Government, the Federal Republic, a Central Republic, and a Dictatorship; then again in quick order a Central Republic, Federal Republic, and Dictatorship; followed again by Central and Federal, Dictatorial, Federal and Anarchical rule, in interminable confusion. Revolutions, conspiracies, reactions, decrees, plans, pronunciamientos, ceaselessly succeed each other -- each of them interspersed with bloody wars, and each of them working out always anarchy and tyranny, social distraction and national ruin, until, at last, the unfortunate and struggling Republic seems ready to finally dissolve at the touch of any foreign foe. The administrators of the various Governments have been changed over fifty times in the last thirty years -- most of them having been successively driven out by some such conspiracy as that which is now attempting to overthrow this Republic and its constitutionally elected President. In one year alone there were no fewer than five acting Presidents in succession; and during the last three years the Government has been changed four limes, and has had no less than seven supreme executive officers. SANTA ANNA comes to the surface as chief no less than ten times -- five times as President under the Federal Republic, twice as Provisional Dictator, twice as President under the Central Republic, and once and finally as Supreme Dictator in permanence -- his terms of office varying from a fortnight to a half-year or year apiece, though at his last dictatorship he managed to hold the reins of power for two years, three months and twenty-two days. In 1839, BRAVO enjoyed the glory of the Presidency for a week, and again, seven years later, for six days. The associate Triumvirs ruled the Confederate Republic for a week and a day. COMONFORT was substitutionary President of the third Federal Republic for one year, eleven months and nineteen days; he then succeeded to the Constitutional Presidency of the same, which he held for seventeen days; and finally became provisional President of the Central Republic, which he held for twenty-eight days. Few of the Presidents have maintained their seats more than a few brief months before they were overtaken by a successful rival, when they in turn then speedily joined the great army of plotters against whoever happened to hold the reins of power. And thus have they gone on, forever overthrowing and being overthrown, through the long and dreary roll of Mexican chiefs. Besides these general revolutions, the local conspiracies, secessions, and revolts have never ceased for a month since the Republic had an existence.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Warning to Us.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Warning to Us.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1ab0f98a-d4ee-503c-861c-c68391dd5e39,698,nyt://article/1ab0f98a-d4ee-503c-861c-c68391dd5e39,

BERDAN, of the Regiment of Sharp-shooters. Several years ago Mr. BERDAN, then a very young man, and not so widely known as he is now, either as an inventor, for his personal qualities, or as a rifle shot, was talking with a friend in the barroom of an inn at a town on the Kentucky side of the Ohio. In the room was also one of those Bowie-knife bullies who infest the South and West; a man who had made himself dreaded wherever he was known by his readiness to pick a quarrel, and his skill with the knife, the rifle and the pistol. This man, stepping up to Mr. BERDAN's friend, said that he wanted to speak to him. ""Wait a moment,"" was the reply; and the interrupted conversation went on. Soon the bully stepped up again, and, laying his hand on the shoulder of his acquaintance, said, in a tone half-banter, half-earnest, ""J------, when I tell you I want you, I expect you to come."" ""Certainly, certainly; but Mr. BERDAN was talking about his invention; and it was so interesting that""------. ""Oh, d------ those Yankee inventions, and d------ the fellows that come to sell them."" The words were hardly well spoken when the speaker was flying backward over a huge open stove behind him, being constrained thereto by a well-delivered blow between the eyes from Mr. BERDAN's right arm. There was a tumult at once; and men threw themselves between the inventor and immediate death. They informed him, however, that his fate was but postponed. His opponent would of course challenge him, and certainly kill him if he accepted; and if he did not accept, shoot him ""on sight"" for not accepting. Mr. BERDAN replied that he was not a fighting man, but that ""on this occasion he fought."" He was challenged in due form and accepted -- naming, as his weapons, rifles at two hundred yards. The terms suited his opponent ""exactly,"" but he begged Mr. B.'s indulgence for a few days, till he recovered the use of his eyes. Mr. B. was accommodating. But the blow was so well planted that recovery was rather slower than was expected; and meantime a long-expected rifle match came off in the neighborhood which was to decide the merits of two rival manufacturers, one of whom was the famous WESSON. WESSON had undertaken, to produce a man who, with his rifle, could beat DIMMICK, a great shot, whose remarkable feats had brought the rival gun into general favor. To make the story short, WESSON's champion proved to be Mr. BEEDAN, who, on three-trials of ten or twelve shots each, at two hundred yards, not only beat DIMMICK on every trial, but made the greatest rifle-shooting on record in this country. His name, of course, was, in that place, at once in every body's mouth; but the nub of the whole affair was, that he soon received a message from his challenger that it was hardly worth while for him to await the recovery of the damaged eye, and that he might consider the challenge as withdrawn! And so ended the only duel and the only rifle-match in which Col. BERDAN was engaged.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Value of Skill in sharp-shooting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Value of Skill in sharp-shooting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6f0ccd4d-ac14-535a-ba02-d2e337a57990,631,nyt://article/6f0ccd4d-ac14-535a-ba02-d2e337a57990,

The Portuguese have, for some time past, yearly purchased large quantities of cotton cloths for use among the slaves of Brazil. From Lagos and the Bight of Benin it is stated that 200,000 cotton cloths of native manufacture had been exported in 1857, the amount of weight being nearly 1,000,000 pounds. These, of course, are more cumbrous than articles of American manufacture. Merrimac, or Lowell manufactured cottons, would soon supplant the native fabrics for most purposes, if the natives could exchange their raw materials for the various manufactured articles of America or England.

But RHETT, after all his bluster, took to his heels with the rest of his chivalric crew, leaving guns, pistols, swords, knapsacks, and even their breeches and boots -- (only think of it, a chivalry cutting stick, without his pistol or pantaloons) -- to say nothing of their half-cooked dinner and several copies of the Mercury -- as trophies to the Yankees!

The sudden apparent transfer of this prosperous and peaceful region from the support of the Union to the cause of treason was a result of the unhappy example of two or three popular and very able leaders, who were everawed by the demonstrations of the conspirators within and around the Richmond Convention. It was a change of sentiment in its very nature and origin wholly factitious, and produced, in a great degree, by a gross misapprehension of the facts which led to the President's Proclamation, and finally effected by the use of a well-arranged political machinery, in a moment of extreme popular excitement. Thus far the people of the valley have felt but lightly the pressure of the war. They have seen nothing but the march of gay and hopeful ranks, in high spirits and good humor, on the way to the appointed field, where the reputation of Southern prowess was to be practically vindicated by easy victories over an unchivalrous Northern rabble.

WATSON, who resides at No. 87 First-place, Brooklyn, fell overboard from the upper deck.

WATSON, who resides at No. 87 First-place, Brooklyn, fell overboard from the upper deck. He was in charge of his sister, aged twelve or fourteen, and was accompanied by a brother, aged about eight. They were going to Clifton to visit some friends. The little fellow was sitting on the lower rope of the guard, near the pilot house aft. A woman who had cakes for sale wished to pass with her basket, and as he was making room for her, he lost his balance and went over. A scream of horror came from all who saw it, and the sister and brother were well nigh paralyzed with fright. A gentleman who sat near hurried to the pilot house, and notified the man at the helm, ""a child overboard!"" In an instant the bell clanged in the engineer's room, wheels and rudders were reversed, the pilot hastened to the other pilot-house, and the boat went back with all speed, following the wake she had just left. A steamboat was seen coming down the bay and crossing our tack about half a mile off, at about the point where the child went over. Every effort was made to signal them to stop, shout upon shout went over the water from a hundred voices, and hats and handkerchiefs were used with a downward movement; but, strange to say, it was interpreted to be what it did not resemble, and these signs of warning and distress were answered by cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs. This was followed by a loud moan of disappointment, and cries of, ""These, they have run over him!"" All hope of saving the boy seemed to be stifled, but the returning boat kept on, feeling her way cautiously, when presently a little hat was descried, and then a little body, still, buoyant, and face upward. A thrill of hopeful expectation of a rescue was felt by the hundred anxious passengers. ""There he is!"" ""There he is!"" ""Slack up!"" ""Stop her!"" The pilot sounded his bell to slow the engines, when a tail, spare man was seen divesting himself of hat, coat, vest and boots. He dropped himself from the upper to the lower forward deck; went over the guards, hung down by his hands, and dropped into the water just as the boat was about coming in contact with the body. She had a little too much headway, and cries were heard on all sides, ""They will be struck by the wheel!"" ""Stop her!"" Sure enough, they would have been struck, but, with wonderful presence of mind, the gentleman dove under the wheel and came up near the stern with the boy in his arms. Life-preservers were thrown over and a small boat was lowered. The gentleman seized the latter with one hand, laid the boy in with the other, got in himself, and commenced at once to roll and rub him. Presently they were taken on board; the child was heard to cry, and the glad news, ""He is alive!"" ""He will be saved!"" went from mouth to mouth until every face beamed with a smile of intense satisfaction. The sister and brother came forward excited and in tears. They assisted to divest him of his drenched clothing; a blanket was brought, in which he was wrapped, and the efforts to resuscitate were diligently pushed. One gentleman look from his wallet a newspaper slip containing printed directions, by E. MERIAM, for rescusitating a drowned person. When the boat arrived at Quarantine landing, the body was taken to the residence of the Health Officer, where Dr. GUNS and the other health officer, with the ladies in the house, gave proper attention to the little sufferer. Word was immediately sent to friends at Clifton, and the parents were telegraphed to Brooklyn. They arrived between 8 and 9 o'clock, and found that all was well. The child was restored to consciousness, and his chief complaint was thus expressed: ""Papa, I fell in water and lost my hat."" It was with much difficulty that the brave man who thus periled his own life to save this little fellow could be induced to give his name; but the impropriety of his keeping it, from the knowledge of the parents was so urged upon him that he finally wrote his address on a card for the sister, with a request not to show it except to her parents. It transpired, however, at the landing, that this noble deed was performed by ""Capt. J.W. KITTREDGE, care of E.F. TEFT & Co., Nos. 126 and 128 [???]-street, New-York."" His wife, with a nurse and child, were believed to be on board at the time.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS; Arrivals in the City.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS; Arrivals in the City.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80f44437-34de-550e-a3ad-3b32733cd9a2,1903,nyt://article/80f44437-34de-550e-a3ad-3b32733cd9a2,

The head of the centre column was preceded by a thirty-pounder rifled cannon to clear the way of any masked batteries which the enemy might open, and at 6 o'clock the first shot was fired from it, which, however, was not replied to. Col. RICHARDSON commanded the column which took the road to Bull's Run, where the fight of Thursday took place; Gen. TYLER commanded the centre column, which took the Warrenton road; and Col. HUNTER commanded the flank movement, by which the main attack was made -- the two other movements being intended as feints. Our artillery made various attempts to draw the fire of the enemy, but they kept silent until nearly nine o'clock, when rapid shots were exchanged between the skirmishers. Soon afterwards heavy clouds of dust were seen in the rear of the rebel position, indicating large reinforcements from Manassas, for which they had probably been waiting before replying to the fire of our artillery. At half-past eleven, the head of HUNTER's column was discovered across the Run, advancing upon the rebel flank, and the engagement then soon became very active. A constant roll of musketry marked his advance, while the artillery of the centre column played incessantly upon the enemy, forcing them to fall back. They made three attempts to charge with the bayonet upon our troops, but were each time repulsed with terrible loss. Their cavalry also made an attempt upon our flank, but that met with no better success. According to the latest bulletins received at Head-quarters in Washington, the rebels were finally compelled to retire with precipitation from their position, and fall back behind their Manassas lines -- some accounts say with the loss of all their ordnance and equipments. Our latest advices direct from the battle-field have the fight still in progress, but there seems to be no doubt, from the nature of the latest official bulletins, that the success of the National arms has been complete. The losses in killed and wounded on our side are very heavy -- those of the rebels must have been fearful, from the superior nature of our arms, and the rapidity and precision with which they were served.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4fb4cf2-f1cb-5b79-9bbf-840b9c630728,1678,nyt://article/d4fb4cf2-f1cb-5b79-9bbf-840b9c630728,

The newsboys -- who, if they wrong as a rule, are sometimes wronged as an exception -- were then in demand. Their stock of papers was rapidly exhausted, and the supply not being able to keep pace with the demand, the fortunate possessor of an extra became a sort of animated bulletin. Circles that constantly increased gathered around him, and heard with consternation the unhappy tidings. From 11 A.M. until midnight business, as an absorbing and distinct pursuit, was virtually suspended. Those who made a show of attending to it were so disheartened and preoccupied, that they will probably regret having done so.

McDOWELL'S command, instead of pushing, victorious, through the Rebel lines at Manassas Junction, has fallen back, and now re-occupies the intrenched position at Arlington Heights and Alexandria, having been terribly cut up, and having lost a great number of cannon and other appliances of war. From among the numerous and evidently exaggerated statements which have reached us, it is impossible to extract the exact truth relative to the cause and progress of this retrograde movement, and we must leave it for our correspondents, and the official dispatches shortly to be published, to place the mutter clearly before the public. It is encouraging to know, however, that the latest telegrams which reach us are of a decidedly more cheerful character than the first once. It appears that up to the date of our intest dispatches from the battle-field on Sunday evening, the greatest success was attending the movements of our Army. The Engineer Corps were about erecting a pontoon bridge across Bull's Run, the batteries were being unmasked one after the other, and the enemy were seemingly in retreat, when a terrine panic broke out among the teamsters, who had incansiously advanced too far, which was communicated to the numerous body of civilians present, and subsequently to some of the volunteers, -- the result of which was finally a general retreat. Our losses, in killed and wounded only a partial list of which we are able to give this morning, are frightful, though not so bad as at first represented. It is useless to give estimates, as they are wholly unreliable.

The gallant Army of the Union has been routed and put to flight by the Army of the rebels: and if, from the fragments enough material can be gathered to insure the immediate safety of the Capital, the nation will have a melancholy and imperfect reason for congratulation. The plot of this tragedy it is hardly worth while to analyze. We only know that recoiling from their exposed encounter with hostile batteries, on Thursday last, our troops had prepared themselves for an exhibition of greater strength and more desperate valor; and that up to a certain hour on Sunday afternoon, these preparations had borne fruit in a series of brilliant successes, in which three powerful batteries of the enemy had been captured. At this moment, the foe seemed to have redoubled his forces, and to have brought to the struggle with our exhausted, but courageous fellows, a renewed and irresistible power, against which they found themselves unable to make head. Upon our lines of exhausted and inexperienced soldiers, hostile cavalry in great numbers charged impetuously: a species of assault for which they had no preparation, and which only veterans know how successfully to repel. A panic retreat followed; artillery, baggage, arms are abandoned to an enemy which, strange to say, made no pursuit; and the defeated only paused within the lines of their distant intrenchments. To attempt any diminution of this victory of the rebels would be absurd self-delusion. The world will tell over the count of dead and wounded; the guns, nearly a hundred in number, captured by the victors, and the standard seized -- alas, that the starry flag of our fathers should be that standard -- and from these elements will determine the real magnitude of the National loss.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Disaster in Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Disaster in Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7d28fa15-43a6-5224-9533-21a49786180a,1154,nyt://article/7d28fa15-43a6-5224-9533-21a49786180a,

The very interesting question then arises, and one which Congress must decide before adjourning -- on whose shoulders, or, in other words, on what species of property, shall this heavy burden be imposed? We see by the amended Tariff Act, just received from Washington, that Congress has acted in part on that branch of the subject embracing ""indirect"" taxation, by taxing tea fifteen cents, coffee five cents, and sugars of different kinds from two and a half to six cents a pound, with some increase of preexisting rates on some other articles of less importance. It is estimated that the additional revenues provided by this bill, necessarily fluctuating with the consumption of the articles taxed, will yield about thirty-five millions. That amount, we fear, will do little more than supply the deficiency of our preexisting revenues in paying the ordinary expenses of the Government. True it is, that not only those expenses, but all the expenses of the War, might be largely reduced, if anything like a rigid or prudent economy could find its way into Congress, -- but we despair of that. We believe our faithful representative, Mr. CONKLING, and his associates on the Retrenchment Committee, to be gentlemen of pure character and patriotic aims, but we are admonished by all past experience not to indulge the romantic hope, that any Committee will be permitted to abridge, to any material extent, the salaries or perquisites or means of depredation of favored officeholders.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War Tax.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War Tax.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80147f5b-13aa-5aeb-b3e3-3252c9ab5503,1443,nyt://article/80147f5b-13aa-5aeb-b3e3-3252c9ab5503,

GARNETT recently visited Rich Mountain, when his advise respecting rear defences was asked. The engineer was consulted, and a council of war was held, when it was unanimously decided that the configuration of the mountain made it physically impossible for the National troops to turn the rebel flank and get into their rear. So it seems. That Gen. MCCLELLAN did not concur in this view was afterwards established. But I mention as a remarkable fact that on Sunday night preceding the battle, and while Gen. MCCLELLAN was encamped at Buckhannon, he wrote a letter to Gen. SCOTT, in which he said: ""We shall probably, have a fight at Roaring Run or Rich Mountain, one or the other. I shall there repeat your Cerro Gordo operation, turn the enemy's flank and assail his rear."" This whole campaign has developed, in its main features, precisely according to the plan formed by Gen.

In the first flush of excitement attending the information of the grand advance upon the intrenched hosts of the enemy, the capture of their batteries, and resistance to their cavalry charges, men's blood received fresh warmth from the flames of patriotic fire and coursed more swiftly through their veins. In their station, shared even by the many who wait in eager suspense tidings of them they hold most dear, the thought of a repulse was never harbored. Had not the course of the authorities been marked by a full consciousness of overwhelming power? The populace, self-sacrificing and earnest in waging the war on behalf of liberty had flocked in legions to the national defence. Thousands more, many of whom had already organized into regiments, awaiting but a word to take the field, but that word from the Government never came. On the contrary, they were rejected. A feeling of security, amounting almost to a sense of invincibility, had taken possession of the popular mind, but yesterday it was rudely broken. Men were stricken with dismay when the first brief dispatch announcing the retreat of the Union forces was bulletined by the City Press. The statement came with crushing force, and none were prepared to credit it. All doubted its truth, and awaited, with anxiety, further advices. Some considered the announcement a cruel ruse of the stuck brokers, and bets were freely offered against its being true. Others believed that it might be fact, but if so, it was a feint of MCDOWELL's to draw the enemy from behind his batteries and attack him in the field.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HOW THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED IN BROOKLYN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HOW THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED IN BROOKLYN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eb864588-0ec7-528d-aef1-e97ff852d7e1,760,nyt://article/eb864588-0ec7-528d-aef1-e97ff852d7e1,

Therefore, they do not like to squat down in the hennery, surrounded by a greedy flock, that are ready to pounce into the nest, as soon as an egg is layed, and devour it. Therefore, to gratify the hen's secretiveness, and at the same time save the eggs from being devoured by one of the flock, my practice has been, for a number of years, to make their nests in nail kegs -- not those that are very small, not the largest ones -- but of those that will hold about one hundred pounds of nails. In years past, I have been accustomed to fill a keg about half full of straw for a nest; but, the past Winter, I have sawed all the kegs in two equal parts -- knocking out the heads, and then nail a piece of cloth over the large end of each half keg, for a bottom. Any kind of old or new cloth may be tacked on with small trimming tacks. During the Winter, these half kegs are miled up against the side of the hennery, about four feet from the floor. Hens that lay will soon learn that when they get into these nests, their fellows cannot see them, as they are completely secluded in their cosy little nests; and if they themselves are disposed to eat eggs, they find that, if they attempt it while standing on the edge of the keg, they cannot reach them conveniently; and if they hop down into the nest, and attempt to pick the eggs, they will roll down against their feet, and they soon learn that they are not able to pick hard enough in such a position to break the shell. I find that a cloth bottom is superior to a wooden bottom, covered with a nest of straw. As the weather becomes warmer, so that the hens seek nests in the yard, we make nests in secluded nooks, or the kegs might be removed from the hennery and nailed against the side of the fence, and a little roof made over them.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f123b7c2-79fd-5802-8166-310342027a2c,1394,nyt://article/f123b7c2-79fd-5802-8166-310342027a2c,

The Seventy-ninth seems to have emulated the Irish Regiment in its sturdy and manly fighting qualities. And when the retreat had been ordered, it was the masterly skill of the German Brigade, under Col. BLENKER, which covered the movement, and prevented any accumulated disasters. This tribute, so well earned, cannot detract from the credit of the native troops. The immense sacrifice of life sustained by the Fire Zouaves and the Seventy-first Regiments proves how dauntlessly both of them must have held the most dangerous positions, and urged their conflict with the enemy.

"In the commencement of this campaign we urged upon the authorities the necessity of organizing an efficient corps of cavalry for the Army. We were met by the assertion that cavalry had ceased to be regarded as essential to military operations, and that the same number of men would be more serviceable on foot than mounted. In fact, we were told that cavalry was obsolete in modern military science. The events of the last few days have demonstrated that we were right in our views, or that the authorities at Washington have changed theirs, for they are now full of energy in the organization of regiments of cavalry, which should, in common prudence, have been in the field long ago. A force of five or ten thousand men, good riders, accustomed to the use of horses from their youth, might easily have been raised in the State of New-York alone, and who, by this time, might have been so drilled and taught as to have been one of the most efficient branches of the military power of the country. It would almost seem that we are doomed to learn wisdom only from the lessons of disaster, and that we begin to study these only on the day after defeat.

As our dispatches continue to come in, they cut down the exaggerations of the first reports, and we now begin to have a more definite idea of what we have suffered. It is probable that our loss in killed and wounded will not exceed six hundred. Several of the cannon reported to have fallen into the hands of the enemy, are found to be saved. The number of baggage wagons lost is much less than at first reported -- and so of other items. On the other hand, the losses of the rebels, in killed and wounded, must have been fearful. It is estimated at Memphis, Tenn., to reach three thousand, and the nature of the dispatches from the rebel camp to the Southern journals are of a tone indicating anything but the exhilaration of victory. Perhaps the most significant indication is the fact that they made no attempt to follow our retiring forces, but remained behind their intrenchments. Col. EINSTEIN, of the Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania Regiment, returned to the battle-field with a party of men about 11 o'clock on Sunday night, and brought away six pieces of our artillery which had been left behind, without any attempt at molestation on the part of the enemy, who were at that time nowhere in sight. It appears, also, that a portion of our army still remains at Centreville, where no attempt has been made to molest them. Meanwhile the most vigorous measures have been inaugurated by the Government to correct the mistake which has been made.

After the developments of the last three months, not even a Peace Society can be found to oppose the better and immediate protection of our great hasbors against rifle-armed and steel-clad invasion. The eighteen-inch globes of the new Rodman guns, and the yard-long bolts -- we may as well, say thunderbolts -- of the steel cannon which we shall mount on our forts one of these days -- ""built-up"" jobs to the contrary -- may, indeed, scatter the ponderous scales of such sea-monsters. as the Warrior and the Black Prince, but thinking people will hardly allow these fast-sailing leviathans the advantage of an undisputed channel and a flood tide, with only the gauntlet, of a few broadsides from shore, to run, which passed, the city itself is at the mercy of the enemy's shells and red-hot shot. They want steel-hide to meet steel-hide in fair fight, disputing every inch of brine by hard blows in close quarters, so that the shore, batteries may have time to drive the intruder back or to the bottom; for a coat of steel mail is not going to be knocked into a wreck during the few moments it will occupy in sailing under our forts at fifteen or sixteen miles an hour; and if the Warrior should get as far as Hoboken with so much left of her as half-a-dozen guns, men enough to serve them, and whole compartments enough to keep them out of water, she could make short work with the City of New-York. It is not probable that a wooden enemy could ever get further than Fort Hamilton; but it is extremely probable that out of a small fleet of mailed ships, with no opposition but stationary guns on shore, at least one could sail beyond shot-range, and so bombard the City at its leisure. Such ships must be met by others of a similar or better class, competent to engage and, in fact, monopolize their attentions -the forts will do the rest. To send wooden walls against a volcano of red-hot metal would be perfectly idle; a few hundred rifle-armed gun-boats, surrounding the Warrior, might sink her; but evidently the shortest, surest, and cheapest way to fight her, and to delay her -- that is the great point -- is to send another Warrior out to meet her.

As soon as it became known that they were in the Museum, they were surrounded by a large crowd of the visitors present, and at once found themselves the lions of the occasion, and apparently the chief attraction of the place. So great was the anxiety of the crowd to hear the particulars of their encounter with the pirates, and so many times were they obliged to repeat the story, that they had no time to inspect the curiosities which they came to see, and requested of Mr. BARNUM to be allowed to come again to-day free of charge. They were told that they might come as often as they pleased, and subsequently Mr. BARNUM obtained permission from the District-Attorney for them to visit the Museum daily until otherwise ordered. The large numbers of people who have applied for permission to see them at the house for the detention of witnesses will, therefore, have an opportunity of gratifying their curiosity by visiting the Museum on any day during the coming week.

When we all believedthat we had lost nearly three thousand men in the battle, that our soldiers had fled because they dared not face the rebels, leaving all their artillery upon the field, flinging away their muskets and knapsacks to facilitate their escape from an exultant and pursuing foe; that the panic was so utter and so universal that no regiment left the field in order; that our rear was not protected, and that the disorderly fugitives could not be rallied at any point upon our line of communication, -- in short, that the whole main body of the National Army had been put to utter and ignominious rout, that we had suffered disgrace and demoralization, as well as defeat, and That for the present all was lost, including honor, the temporary feeling was one of surprise, of sadness, almost of woe. Women who had no personal friends in the field wept and lamented as if they had been bereaved; and silent men wished for the moment that they were women, that they might thus relieve their overcharged bosoms. But amid all this there was not even a momentary flinching from the determination to put down the insurrection by the strong hand. The flood rose the higher because of the obstacle that it encountered, and in a moment broke it down, and bore it off, on a resistless current. Men were sorrowful, but not despondent; and went about with a compression of the lip and a sad determination in the eye that boded ill to those who had brought them to this sorrow. And now that we find that our volunteers more than made good our expectations of them, that even when fighting under every disadvantage, they proved, one to two, more than a match for their opponents, and that the flight began not among those who were in action, but with the teamsters and the reserve, and that our twenty thousand left their sixty thousand foes not in a condition to pursue, the spirit of the country has risen to a higher point than that at which it stood before this ill-starred movement on Manassas; and the only audible voice is that which calls for instant and vigorous preparation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Submission, not War, is Ruin.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Submission, not War, is Ruin.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f08f333-6575-578b-848a-90367727c79b,1222,nyt://article/2f08f333-6575-578b-848a-90367727c79b,

A complete reorganization of the Army is to take place immediately, and such steps will be adopted as will insure us, as far as it is possible to do so, against incompetency among the officers. To this end general orders were issued yesterday from the War Department, that all officers of regiments will hereafter be subject to examination by a Board of officers, to be appointed by the Secretary of War, with the concurrence of the Lieutenant-General, in order that their fitness for the positions assigned them may be assured -- their places, should they be be found incompetent, to be filled by officers who shall have passed an examination successfully. Business at the War Department yesterday was remarkably heavy. Tenders of troops are made in surprising numbers. Up to 12 o'clock, at noon our dispatches state, nearly eighty thousand new men had been accepted, and are now being mustered into the service. It is understood that Illinois alone has offered seventeen, and Indiana ten new regiments, some of which are already on the way. The response to the new call of the Government is wonderfully prompt, and indicative of a spirit and determination which will certainly carry us in the end over all intervening obstacles to success.

Although we have not to report any important event, yet the National troops are evidently led by energetic commanders. Gen. SCOTT is censured by the more restlessspirits for his slow and cautious system of tactics; but a brilliant Napoleonic march and occupation of a hostile capital are feats which can only be accomplished by a disciplined army or against a most contemptible foe. Now, Gen. SCOTT has neither trained soldiers under him, nor is he marching against Mexicans. His army is formed, doubtless, of good material, and in a few months his recruits may be turned into excellent soldiers:but at present they are neither soldiers, nor, what is worse, have they soldiers to command them. Ludicrous stories are told of the incapacity of the National officers, numbers of whom are mere party politicians, who have received Colonelcies, and even Generalships, instead of being appointed Postmasters and Collectors. Even the men highest in command, like Gen. BANKS, have no special training; and though they may, like Roman patricians, be able to turn from their farms to give advice to their clients one day, and to command the legions the next, they have as yet given no proofs of such versatility, and their genius is distrusted exceedingly by their Commander-in-Chief, Gen. SCOTT himself. This veteran officer, whose abilities are justly appreciated by his countrymen, is described as much annoyed and hampered by the subordinates who are forced upon him; and this, coupled with the rawness of his army, has induced him to insist on slow and well-considered movements. It is said that he has had more than one dispute with members of the President's Cabinet, who are desirous that he should practise a more dashing style of warfare. On one occasion the General met the Cabinet, and, being urged to march at once on Richmond, declared that he would rather resign his command than forfeit his reputation, and thus only did he succeed in silencing his critics.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WISDOM OF DELAY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WISDOM OF DELAY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76be76f6-7544-5c95-ac08-684dcb8b4876,531,nyt://article/76be76f6-7544-5c95-ac08-684dcb8b4876,

It is the tendency of the world to give a man credit for only one order of talents.

But the most dangerous quality he can have is to be brilliant and entertaining, for then everybody will agree that he cannot be profound and far-sighted, a calm thinker, and so forth.

Must shocking stories begin to be reported of the barbarities practised by the rebels upon the wounded men and prisoners of the Union forces that fall into their hands.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/25/archives/barbarities-of-the-war.html,,"Must shocking stories begin to be reported of the barbarities practised by the rebels upon the wounded men and prisoners of the Union forces that fall into their hands. We are told of their slashing the throats of some from ear to ear; of their cutting off the heads of others, and kicking them about as footballs; and of their setting up the wounded against trees, and firing at them as targets, or torturing them with the plunges of bayonets at their bodies. To cap the climax of atrocities, it is stated that a hospital in which many wounded soldiers were suffering extreme agony, or quietly yielding up the battle of life, was fired upon and burned. An isolated story of inhuman treatment in the midst of a battle, or in the heat of pursuit, after one is fought, would not be entitled to grave consideration, as illustrating the general animus of an Army; for exceptional cases of cruelty will always, and among all people occur. But the iteration of these stories of rebel barbarity from so many sources, and in such various forms, compel us to the belief that there is a deeper foundation for them than the casual passion of individual natures, and that there is some general prevailing temper in the rebel Army that finds its natural outburst in these barbarities. We have only to look to the public teachings of the leaders of the rebellion to find, we think, the ready explanation of the sanguinary and demoniac deeds we hear related of their men. By their proclamations and messages, both BEAUREGARD and JEFFERSON DAVIS have branded the Union troops that they are now fighting as outlaws of civilized warfare. The former, when he assumed command at Manassas, and commenced to gather an Army around him, issued a manifesto to the people of the Southern States full of malice and of lies, as wicked as the devil himself could have coined them. He declared that the soldiers of the loyal States, then about to invade Virginia, were brutal robbers who had no honest sentiment to inspire them, but were animated by the promise of the ""beauty and booty"" of the South, with which to gratify their lust and their love of plunder. This base libel, spread broadcast among an ignorant and untraveled people such as compose so large a part of the population of the Southern States, was calculated to excite the deepest fears and the most fiendish resentment towards the soldiers of the Union. What mercy was due and what could be given to a horde of vandals so rapacious and so vile as the Union troops were represented to be.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Barbarities of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Barbarities of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be25df4d-3adb-5958-9cc7-62621324702c,1169,nyt://article/be25df4d-3adb-5958-9cc7-62621324702c,

The regiment left St. Johnsbury on the 24th, and came via Springfield and Hartford, to New-Haven, where the steamer Elm City was chartered to convey them to Jersey City, where they took a special train for Baltimore. Along the whole route the residents of the various towns where the train stopped at, came to the stations and cheered them, in fact the whole journey was a complete ovation; the citizens sent into the cars all sorts of refreshments to regale the men.

The American Journal of Science and Arts has just issued an extra giving some particulars of the wonderful body which has just paid us a passing visit. Observations made by Lieut.

The Sixty-ninth left Fort Corcoran on Tuesday, at 3 o'clock P.M., and encamped that night at Fairfax Court-house. Wednesday night reached Germantown. On Thursday morning, the Division under Col. SHERMAN took up the line of march, led by the Twelfth New-York Volunteers. After marching a short distance, a masked battery opened on them. Our regiment were ordered by Gen. TYLER to advance. After a short time we received orders through Gen. MCDOWELL to fall back, when we halted for the night. About 2 o'clock in the morning we passed to the right of the battery without any danger. Marched about three miles and formed into line of battle, with our battery firing a gun at intervals to get the enemy out, which at length we did, they having returned a few shots. Shortly after the action became general. We succeeded in forcing our way down into the Run, (like a ravine,) between two mountains, in doing which we had to march through mud and water knee-deep. We marched double-quick about a mile to a hill, where there was a small house, uninhabited, where we afterwards left our wounded. Here we engaged a large number of the enemy's infantry, which we succeeded in driving back, the masked batteries playing on us. The other divisions of our Army engaged the enemy. The fight continued without intermission till 4 o'clock P.M., when we succeeded in silencing three or four batteries. The firing then ceased. We felt quite elated, seeing Gen. MCDOWELL complimenting Col. CORCORAN on the success of our victory. Suddenly a large reinforcement came up, and opened on us with terrific effect. We suffered terribly, but firmly kept our ground. Once, our regimental flag was captured; but Capt. THOMAS FRANCIS MEAGHER, clutching the green flag, and shouting to the men, rushed after to capture it, which we eventually did. Capt. WILDEY, of the Fire Zouaves, shot the rebel who held the flag. We ran up to the edge of the woods and fired at them. They were behind natural rocks with earthen works, with four guns or more in each battery. We captured four. We found them nearly all spiked. Each battery was at distances averaging about two hundred yards they looked like bee hives. The country round was full of brushwood and trees, which gave them an advantage. The width of the road was only about 12 feet, a slight descent to the fields at each side. The ravine on an average was about one-half mile wide, with masked batteries at each side. It was utterly impossible we could hold out. We lost several of our officers, including Capt. HAGGERTY, Company A, Acting-Lieut.-Col. DALTON, Capt. CATANAR, and a few others. It was melancholy to see the poor fellows lying all around dead. I contrasted it with the joy they felt only a few minutes before, and felt sad. However, one has no thought in battle; the noise and confusion is really awful; it completely crushes out all feeling. Among those who distinguished themselves, (that I saw,) was the Colonel, who was very cool and collected. Capt. THOS. FRANCIS MEAGHER, who acted as aid to Col. CORCORAN. He rode a splendid while horse. He lost his cap, and was remarkable in his bare head, urging the men forward. Lieut. COONAN, of Company J, and private MAXWELL SULLIVAN Company C, were remarkable in their attempt to rescue the regimental colors. We got orders to retreat, which we did in good order, forming a hollow square.

The points of defence of this Pennsylvania General are as follows: Gen. JOHNSTON was strongly intrenched at Winchester; he had recently been reinforced by troops from Georgia, Alabama and elsewhere, running up the numbers of his Army to 35,000 men, besides 6,000 Virginia militia, making a total of 40,000 men. On the other hand, Gen. PATTERSON says he had less than 20,000 men, and of these, nineteen regiments were within a few days of the expiration of their enlistment, and all but four of these had positively declined to stay one hour beyond their time. Under these circumstances, Gen.

S.M., reached the City by the New-Jersey Railroad yesterday, about 3 o'clock, P.M. The ovation with which they were greeted in Philadelphia, and the extraordinary demand for cars for transporting the many regiments just now going and returning from the seat of war, is given as the cause of detention. Taken in connection with the arrival of the Seventy-first Regiment, the immense outpouring of the people to witness their return, and to do honor to the brave men who have been battling in their country's cause, made the occasion one of the most memorable which New-York has ever seen. The disappointments which occurred on Thursday, only seemed to increase the public interest in the expected ovation, and raise enthusiasm to a higher pitch. Every available spot on Cortlandt street and Broadway for seeing the regiments, was early taken possession of, and many of the fortunate possessors held their position for hours, in order to have a good view of the pageant. The masses which thronged the streets and crowded balconies, windows and house-tops, seemed more like the reception of the Prince of Wales, or the Japanese Ambassadors than like any of the previous military displays which have occurred since the beginning of the war. Standing at the junction of Broadway with Cortlandt-street and looking towards the ferry, the scene was extremely animating and beautiful. From every window of every hotel, store and dwelling the Stars and Stripes fluttered gaily in the breeze, and banners were hung across the street at several places with inscriptions of welcome. The piers adjoining the ferry, the freight sheds, the vessels' decks and rigging were all alive with people. All movement of vehicles was interrupted on West-street near the ferry, and the stages were turned out of their accustomed soutes by the surging masses which blocked up the street. The Washington Grays, Home Guard, under Captain PHILLIPS, which had been on the qui vive since Thursday morning, were stationed on the adjoining pier (No. 14) with their six howitzer battery, to welcome the regiment by a salute. Capt. VARIAN with his troop of bronzed and hardy-looking artillerists were also on the pier with their two guide colors, torn almost to shreds by the enemy's balls during the late engagement. In their eagerness to do the honors in the promptest manner possible, the order to fire was given one boat too soon, and before the mistake was discovered all the ammunition was expended before the boat containing the regiment was near enough for them to hear the report of the guns. The passengers from Jersey City no doubt enjoyed the honor thus accidentally accorded to them. The troop, however, made up the deficiency by drawing up in line and giving them a round of hearty cheers. The regiment responded by waving their caps and by a roll of the drums.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""ARRIVAL OF THE EIGHTH REGIMENT.; THE WELCOMING OVATION ADDRESS OF GOV.

MORGAN has issued his proclamation calling for 25,000 additional volunteers to serve for three years or during the war. The teachings of the past will furnish some instructive lessons in regard to the future organ- ization and management of the volunteer forces in this State, at least. Scenes that have been witnessed at the military depots during the progress of former enlistments, should not be permitted to recur. Recruits without uniforms or arms, unprovided with regular pay or rations, without tents, camp equipage or other accommodations for living or comfort, wandering through the streets or lounging in the grogshops, were the common exhibitions presented not at the State depots alone, but in the villages where recruiting was going on. The volunteers were thus, for weeks, subsisting on their own private means, the voluntary contributions of citizens, or supported at the expense of their officers, until their companies were full, and even then were not mustered into the service of the Government until their regiments had their full quota of men. These again were not accepted until other long weeks had elapsed, during which the process of demoralization, in a military sense at least, was continually progressing. The officers, like the men, in most instances, were wholly unacquainted with military science, without any considerable knowledge of military drill or discipline, and without the presence of United States officers, whose experience could instruct them in the duties and necessities of the service upon which they were entering. These vexatious delays in furnishing equipage and arms, and in being mustered into the service, disheartened the men and discouraged their officers, until the spirit in which they enlisted was permitted to die away under the idleness and inertia of their position. This should not be permitted in the future. Experienced officers belonging to the regular service should be appointed to inspect and receive all who offer and are qualified, the necessary equipage and arms should be furnished, and the volunteers sent at once into camps of instruction and drill, where they could be learning the business of the soldier, free from the temptations which the idleness of waiting throws around them. There should be a camp, or camps, of instruction established without delay, irrespective of the depots at New-York, Albany and Elmira, to which the volunteers should be sent as fast as organized into companies, where they could be under competent officers to superintend their drill and discipline. The military post on Governor's Island, in the Bay of New-York, is admirably adapted to such a purpose. The healthfulness and security of its position, its spacious grounds for drill, and accommodations for a large force, render it one of the very best locations for such a camp that can possibly be selected. It might easily be made the general rendezvouz for instruction of all the volunteers raised under the present call. They might there be placed under the immediate command of experienced officers, who could, in a short time, so far perfect them in discipline and a knowledge of their duties as to make them efficient and reliable soldiers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Call for Volunteers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Call for Volunteers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3df99d83-1599-5582-922c-0f0c0aacc73e,786,nyt://article/3df99d83-1599-5582-922c-0f0c0aacc73e,

Another caustically asks, ""Was it the fault of our Pennsylvania troops that the New-Yorkers ingloriously broke and fled? "" -- a query which, considering the splendid fighting it is now proved ""these New-Yorkers"" did before they were broken, and the inglorious inaction of GROUCHY PATTERSON, does not seem to be either annoying or perplexing.

The company received telegraphic information at 4 1/2 o'clock, that the regiment had embarked and posted the same at the head of the pier for the information of the army of inquirers. Nothing daunted at the two hours' delay, those who had already borne the scorching sun for half a day in anxious expectation of a momentary arrival, quietly sat themselves down for a patient wait. The crowd augmented in numbers, until Battery-place and even the Battery itself were black with the mass of moving humanity.

Considering the uncertainty that has attended the arrival of this regiment, and the many false alarms on the subject, the aspect presented by our streets yesterday was eminently flattering to our mobocracy. From an early hour in the morning they were packed with a dense throng of expectants. Biddy, having had two holidays in succession on the strength of Patrick's devotion to the flag of his country, was not able to turn out in full force and magnificence yesterday. The Fates or the Furies who reserve house cleaning and marketing for Saturday, objected to her neglecting these points of domestic economy. Hence we missed many of those good-lumpered, kindly and beaming faces which were so plentifully scattered around on the previous day's gatherings. But as the regiment marched on its way up town, it was what is called a ""caution"" to observe how rapidly these same faces appeared on the scene again. It is much to be feared that the household gods were sacrificed ruthlessly upon this occasion. Certainly it seemed as if every Biddy in the land had suddenly and mysteriously burst into sight for the express gratification of the gallant Sixty-ninth.

The crisis at last comes. The bank explodes, and stockholders and depositors find themselves involved in the ruin his dishonesty has occasioned. He retires from the institution he has swamped, not into prison not info the criminal Courts to answer for his delinquencies, but to live quietly, perhaps under the ban of popular opinion and the loss of his social position, subsisting from the spoil he has secretly saved, in view of the wreck which he alone was permitted to see in the perspective. He is seldom troubled by indictments, and if he is, the chances are, that through the law's delay and its tenderness towards respectable criminals, he will escape all punishment at last.

It was however, found inconvenient to quarter them at Trenton, and they were temporally dismissed. Still, though they reached Jersey City almost unexpectedly and unannounced, their reception was enthusiastic in the extreme. As soon as their approach to the city was known, the fire-bells were rung, bringing out the Fire Department in full force. The citizens also assembled in thousands to give a welcome to the returning heroes. The company all came back in good health and excellent spirits, and a large majority express an intention of at once re-enlisting for the war. On Tuesday next they return to Trenton, where they will be mustered out of service, after which they will have a formal reception by the authorities and citizens of Jersey City. On Saturday evening a meeting was held at the Mayor's office for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements.

It will consist of athousand men under the command of Col. R.D. GOODWIN. Col. FISHER, late of the United States Army, has accepted the post of Lieutenant-Colonel, and the post of Major will be filled by Col. WHITNEY, late of New-Hampshire. The position of Adjutant is still open for an experienced officer. Several of the line officers are qualified for their posts by previous experience in the United States Army, or by instruction received at West Point. Two flank companies are now being recruited, one as light infantry and engineers, and the other as artillery. They have the beautiful grounds of Camp Washington on Staten Island for quarters, drills, and parades, where the strictest discipline is observed, and the soldiers are carefully provided with rations and clothing, and in all respects made comfortable. Those of the returning three months' regiments who are desirous of reenlisting can have no better chance. They will be immediately mustered into the United States service and be under pay. Any encouragement which our patriotic citizens may feel disposed to bestow upon this regiment in the way of donations of clothing, haversacks, or other articles necessary to the soldier, will be thankfully received at the officers' head-quarters, No. 596 Broadway. The donations of the citizens of New-York of $101, through Acting-Surgeon LINQUIST and Lieut. GIROUX is thankfully acknowledged. Further donations will be gratefully received at head-quarters.

"The suspension of telegraphic and postal intercourse with the South might be of serious inconvenience to the rebels, but for labors of their various organs, acknowledged or disguised, in this City.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/29/archives/the-heralds-larors-in-the-cause-of-rebellion.html,,"-- The suspension of telegraphic and postal intercourse with the South might be of serious inconvenience to the rebels, but for labors of their various organs, acknowledged or disguised, in this City. The News, the Day-Book and Journal of Commerce fulfill their several parts by misrepresenting Northern sentiments and purposes, and stimulating by every artifice the disposition of the South to resist, with a steady and creditable perseverance, which must win golden opinions from their staveholding masters. But the merit of these mercenaries consists mainly in their facility and hardihood in falsehood; while curiously enough, the Herald, their abler colaborer, is even more serviceable by occasionally furnishing the truth in the shape of reliable information at the right moment to the rebel leaders. The Herald is, in fact, a dangerous masked battery, directed incessantly at the cause of the Union, and doing incalculable damage. Whenever it has the opportunity to pre-announce any advance of our Army, it immediately prints detailed enumerations of the forces to be used in the movement; with the distribution, and disposition of the several detachments; or it exhibits its enterprise in publishing minute diagrams of our positions, intrenchments, and assailable points. The latest evidence of this assiduity in the service of treason was afforded yesterday. After announcing that an attack upon the Army at Newport's News is contemplated by the rebels at Yorktown, it gives a minute and carefully prepared diagram of the position to be attacked, with the distribution of the Union troops, and a useful delineation of all the available approaches. The practical value to the enemy of this information is not to be overrated; and that it finds its way to them there is no reason to doubt. In their abandoned camps in Western Virginia and at Fairfax Court-house copies of the Herald were found, showing that a print of such vital ability to their cause could not be dispensed with by the enemy, and that there are secret traitors enough in New-York and Washington to supply them. It will be a nice little bill the Palinurus of Plum Gut will have to present one of these days to Secretary MEMMINGER.

"""At the time the National forces, under Gen. PATTERSON, entered Charlestown, Va., the regiment of Col. PATTERSON was the first to enter that place after the Cavalry and artillery. The regiment had not proceeded far before they discovered a boy, about 13 years of age, running towards them, and on approaching, he was spoken to by one of the officers. The boy uniformed the officer that his name was WM. RYAN, and that his father had been driven from Charlestown by the Secessionists, and that he had gone to New York and joined a regiment to fight for the Union. The boy then informed Capt. THOMPSON, of Company E. that he would show him where a cannon, powder, &c., were concealed, if he would allow him afterwards to remain with the regiment. His request was quickly granted, and Capt. THOMPSON's company was taken to an engine house in the town, where a six pound iron cannon, six kegs of artillery powder, several kegs and canisters of pistol powder, three uniform coats, and one musket were found. The cannon was mounted upon a carriage, but one of the wheels had been removed, subsequently, however, the missing wheel was found in some bushes near by, Young RYAN at once became a favorite with Capt. THOMPSON's men, and they were lavish in their attentions to his wants. Soon after this occurrence, the father of young RYAN was found in the ranks of the New-York Ninth Regiment, then at Harper's Ferry, and informed of the safety of his son. Capt. THOMPSON proposed bringing the boy to Philadelphia and providing for him, which proposition was agreed to by the father, whose position in the Ninth Regiment prevented him from seeing after his son as he would like to do.

PATTERSON, entered Charlestown, Va., the regiment of Col. PATTERSON was the first to enter that place after the Cavalry and artillery. The regiment had not proceeded far before they discovered a boy, about 13 years of age, running towards them, and on approaching, he was spoken to by one of the officers. The boy uniformed the officer that his name was WM. RYAN, and that his father had been driven from Charlestown by the Secessionists, and that he had gone to New York and joined a regiment to fight for the Union. The boy then informed Capt. THOMPSON, of Company E. that he would show him where a cannon, powder, &c., were concealed, if he would allow him afterwards to remain with the regiment. His request was quickly granted, and Capt. THOMPSON's company was taken to an engine house in the town, where a six pound iron cannon, six kegs of artillery powder, several kegs and canisters of pistol powder, three uniform coats, and one musket were found. The cannon was mounted upon a carriage, but one of the wheels had been removed, subsequently, however, the missing wheel was found in some bushes near by, Young RYAN at once became a favorite with Capt. THOMPSON's men, and they were lavish in their attentions to his wants. Soon after this occurrence, the father of young RYAN was found in the ranks of the New-York Ninth Regiment, then at Harper's Ferry, and informed of the safety of his son. Capt. THOMPSON proposed bringing the boy to Philadelphia and providing for him, which proposition was agreed to by the father, whose position in the Ninth Regiment prevented him from seeing after his son as he would like to do.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/29/archives/new-publications.html,,"-- Had the author of Philip Thaxter possessed as much judgment as invention, as well developed powers of analyzation as of description he would have produced a very good novel. As it is, he has not achieved a success, though the book, from its abounding incident and rapid march of events, will undoubtedly find an audience. The major defect of the book is that it seems to have been written with no purpose; it developes no truth, fastens no lasting impression upon the reader's mind. Without at all approaching to anything resembling a sermon, without infringing on the Tract Society's domain, a novel may be instructive. Fiction and truth are by no means so widely separated as the arbitrary signification of the words would imply. The plot of the story, also, is open to the charge of incoherence. The writer seems to have had a variety of dramatic property on hand that he determined to work off -- somewhat as stage managers feel themselves necessitated to use effective scenery, even when it fits loosely and slides heavily in the grooves. Originally it was manifestly his intention to punish faulty folk in this world, and accordingly we find them pinned down by a forked fatality that nothing human could escape. In the further progress of the volume, however, we find this design abandoned, and several wrong doers slip through the fingers of rough retribution. The best part of the book is the scenes and sketches of life in California during the first outbreak of the auriferous fever. They are highly colored indeed, but the first to knock at the Golden Gate will recognize an unmistakeable likeness.

RYAN, and that his father had been driven from Charlestown by the Secessionists, and that he had gone to New-York and joined a regiment to fight for the Union. The boy then informed Capt. THOMPSON, of Company E, that he would show him where a cannon, powder, &c., were concealed, if he would allow him afterwards to remain with the regiment. His request was quickly granted, and Capt. THOMPSON's company was taken to an engine house in the town, where a six pound iron cannon, six kegs of artillery powder, several kegs and canisters of pistol powder, three uniform coats, and one musket were, found. The cannon was mounted upon a carriage, but one of the wheels had been removed; subsequently, however, the missing wheel was found in some bushes near by. Young RYAN at once became a favorite with Capt. THOMPSON's men, and they were lavish in their attentions to his wants. Soon after this occurrence, the father of young RYAN was found in the ranks of the New-York Ninth Regiment, then at Harper-s Ferry, and informed of the safety of his son. Capt. THOMPSON proposed bringing the boy to Philadelphia and providing for him, which proposition was agreed to by the father, whose position in the Ninth Regiment prevented him from seeing after his son as he would like to do. Mr. RYAN stated that when the secession fever broke out, his Union sentiments became known, and he was informed that he would be compelled to fight against the Union men. Not relishing this proposition, he managed to make his escape, but was unable to take his son with him. Young RYAN has been faithfully cared for, and he seems delighted with his change of residence. On his arrival here with the regiment, on Thursday, his clothes were much the worse for wear, but, yesterday, he appeared at the armory of Company E in a new suit, much to the delight of himself and his late companions.

"How to make passable, at short notice, the ordinary bridges of which the rebels have destroyed the superstructure and left the piers, and how to rapidly transport guns, stores and horses over chasms which cannot be speedily bridged, are matters of the highest importance, in following up the Vandals.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/29/archives/improvised-army-bridges.html,,"How to make passable, at short notice, the ordinary bridges of which the rebels have destroyed the superstructure and left the piers, and how to rapidly transport guns, stores and horses over chasms which cannot be speedily bridged, are matters of the highest importance, in following up the Vandals. Aregiment or a column, reaching such a position, has one inherent element of success, possessed by no smaller expedition, viz.: a plenty of power; but without proper apparatus to make it available, they are in some cases perfectly helpless, with all their power. If a battery must be transported, within say three hours, to the opposite and precipitate bank of a wide stream which cannot be forded at a practicable point, and near which the materials for rafts are not abundant, the strength of ten thousand men will no more help the matter than that of so many infants. It requires time to make rafts, and to let artillery and horses safely down banks and haul them up precipices, and when expedition is an element of success in the proposed movement, no amount of mere human force can greatly facilitate matters. Any one can imagine a multitude of cases in which important surprises could be effected by crossing streams at points known to be impracticable by the usual means; and others in which the rapid rebuilding of bridges, or the transhipment of guns and stores by machinery that could be got to work before rafts could be constructed and navigated by any amount of men, would effect important movements which otherwise would have to be abandoned for want of the means of immediate execution. While a thousand men have power enough in the aggregate to perform any such work, this aggregate cannot be applied by any improvised means. While the united strength of five hundred men may be necessary to lift a certain weight or transport a certain load in the allowable time, five hundred men cannot get hold of one gun or one stick of timber, nor stand on one pier or one raft, nor exert their united strength in the particular direction and during the particular time required for rapid movements, with hands, shoulders and levers, alone. And on the other hand, the carrying round of derricks, falls, windlasses and machinery, weighing as much as a battery of heavy artillery, would not pay; and again, the setting up and getting into operation of any complex engineering fixture would be likely to take more time than the whole work of transportation by the old-fashioned rough-and-tumble make-shifts usually employed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Improvised Army Bridges.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Improvised Army Bridges.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a89226be-0ca7-5e40-aa24-f1dc202716b4,1067,nyt://article/a89226be-0ca7-5e40-aa24-f1dc202716b4,

One is, that the plan of all campaigns must be left wholly to the judgment of our military men, than whom the world has none more competent.

"We have begun to realize the fearful results of going into battle with empty stomachs; but since this has been the occasional mistake of every campaign durirg the last six thousand years or so, we have not the courage to hope for a reform at this late day.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/29/archives/bread-for-the-army.html,,"We have begun to realize the fearful results of going into battle with empty stomachs; but since this has been the occasional mistake of every campaign durirg the last six thousand years or so, we have not the courage to hope for a reform at this late day. But there is one reform, of almost equal practical importance, which modern science enables us to institute -- the rapid and economical preparation of wholesome and uniform food in large quantifies. This is a matter of primary importance -- it ranks in advance of rifled-cannon and gun-boats. The gallant Zouave, after all, like other locomotive machines, cannot develop power advantageously under low steam. Not only the character and quality of food, but its timely preparation and distribution demand the most thorough attention of the proper authorities. We are glad to see that the admirable system of SOYER is appreciated by them, and that attempts are making to confer its benefits upon our Army. But still greater and more fundamental and comprehensive reforms and improvements are practicable. We have already referred to a traveling kitchen often suggested by high military authorities, and mentioned more in detail in Col. SCOTT's military dictionary -- a traveling oven, range, etc., which afford a table for the manipulations of the cooks, and at the same time bakes and boils while moving with the regiment, so that no time is lost in long halts, called to prepare food. Had a complement of these kitchens followed up the column, and dispensed a hasty dish of soup, or a fresh loaf, to each fainting soldier, as he temporarily fell back, during a certain conflict within the memory of men still living, some great suffering, some valuable lives, and perhaps something still better would have been saved. Cases will undoubtedly occur during this war, in which some provision of this sort for dispensing a few wholesome and nutritious mouthfuls to soldiers during a day's action, will carry our colors further into the enemy's country than they could be driven by the most improved projectiles; a blood and tissue-making charge, put into the stomach of a brave man, at the right time, is worth a dozen ball-cartridges in the chamber of a hungry man's musket.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bread for the Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bread for the Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Bread', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-07-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e3c975d0-784d-51b7-9960-b6efcebf1164,1301,nyt://article/e3c975d0-784d-51b7-9960-b6efcebf1164,

The American people have hitherto escaped any onerous amount of direct taxation.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/29/archives/the-resources-of-the-nation.html,,"The American people have hitherto escaped any onerous amount of direct taxation. The General Government has sustained itself and paid off its debts from duties on imports, a method of collecting revenue that falls so gently and equably on all, as scarcely to be felt by any, and from the sale of the public lands. The highest State tax, we believe, ever levied in the State of New-York was three and five-seventh mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of its taxable property. This, with the local taxes, outside of the large cities, would probably carry the amount to about four and a half mills on the dollar. We have not the statistics at hand showing the assessed valuation in all the loyal States, but this we know, that a one mill tax in the State of New-York alone produces the sum of about $1,500,000. Assuming the assessed valuation of New-York to be one quarter of that of the loyal States, a mill tax would produce in them alone, an aggregate of $6,000,000 annually, a sum sufficient to pay the interest on a war loan of $100,000,000; -- or, a mill and a quarter tax would be sufficient to pay the interest on a seven per cent, loan of the same amount, leaving a surplus of $480,000 to provide for contingencies, or make up any deficiency in collections. If the whole $500,000,000 provided by Congress were raised, and the payment of interest made dependent upon a direct tax; it would even then amount to less than five and one-eighth mills, or about one-half of one per cent. on the taxable property of those States. It will thus be seen that with the full debt of $500,000,000 contracted, and the interest required to be paid by direct taxation, the burden would still be trifling compared with that which rests upon the people of almost every other nation in the world, and even that would be temporary. The receipts from the Customs under the present tariff, with such judicious amendment as experience shall indicate, together with those from the public lands, would wipe out the principal long before the expiration of the term fixed for its payment.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Resources of the Nation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Resources of the Nation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-07-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee4324cd-a4d4-5b78-8989-4fd0c5d6fff0,608,nyt://article/ee4324cd-a4d4-5b78-8989-4fd0c5d6fff0,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/30/archives/the-real-strength-of-the-rebels.html,,"There is no doubt that, from the most ob- vious necessity, the active force which the rebels can bring into the field is now concentrated in Virginia. It is the battle ground of their own selection, and upon which they have stacked their all. We have it from the best authority that within that State they have now at least 175,000 men, most of them well armed, and led by skillful and desperate officers, who see in defeat their own destruction and disgrace. Their Army is composed of the very elite of the South. Once destroyed, it can never be replaced, either in men or material. Only a small portion of it has been drafted from the class of poor whites, who are too listless and degraded to be of any reliance if brought into the field. To fit out this immense host, the finances of the rebels have been completely exhausted. Seizures of arms from our Government, forced loans, and a feeling of hatred to the North, have supplied the means for sending into the field an army which can neither be paid, nor fed, nor clothed, so as to maintain its efficiency, for any length of time, unless a decided success be achieved. This Army never was, nor will it ever be, so fit for action as at the present moment. Its leaders thoroughly understand their position -- that inaction is ruin, and that immediate success is an imperative necessity. That they are acting upon this conviction and necessity there cannot be a doubt. Indeed, our dispatches from all quarters confirm this. Gen. BANKS' command have retreated into Maryland before Gen. JOHNSTON, who has again appeared in great force upon his old ground. Newport's News is threatened with an immediate attack. We have not had time to learn the movement of the rebels westward, to attack Gens. ROSECRANS and COX, but we are confident such movements have been made. In other words, the 175,000 rebels, released from all fear of an immediate attack on their main position, are hurling this vast force against our isolated and unsupported columns, and it will be good fortune or good generalship if we do not sustain another disaster.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Real Strength of the Rebels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Real Strength of the Rebels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3053d0e3-938e-5954-9019-e3840ea3d404,872,nyt://article/3053d0e3-938e-5954-9019-e3840ea3d404,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/30/archives/italian-patriotism-for-constitutional.html,,"FREEDOM. -- Some of the brave men whose arms established constitutional freedom in Italy, now that their services are no longer needed at home, have come to this country with a view of tendering their aid to the Government in its struggles to maintain the Constitution and the Union. Among these are Col. FRANCESCO ORNESI and Capt. FONTANA and DELLA COSTA, now in this City on their way to Washington. These gentlemen have served with distinction under GARIBALDI ,the evidences of which are furnished by their commissions and the honorable badges their gallantry has won. They go to offer their swords and the benefit of their practical experience to the Government. Very recent experience demonstrates the want of such men, and their services should not be rejected. That they are not now familiar with our language, is an objection met by the fact, that GARIBALDI himself laid the foundations of his military renown in South America, where neither he nor his brave followers knew, at the beginning, scarcely a word of the language of the people in whose armies they served. A very short time will so perfect them in this particular as to make their services available. Their patriotism, their loyalty to constitutional government, and faithfulness to free institutions, entitle them to the favorable consideration of those who have the management of the military affairs of the nation. Neither red tape nor official jealousy should be permitted to stand in the way of their patriotic purposes. It is no reproach to our countrymen that they are not proficients in the science of war. More than three-quarters of a century of peace, with the exception only of some four or five years, with a standing army averaging less than sixteen thousand men, have not been productive of general military skill. We have plenty of courage, plenty of energy and power of endurance of the very best material for an army. What we lack is experience. Those brave Italian patriots who have served for years under one of the most distinguished Generals of the age, are greatly needed now, to instruct and perfect our regiments of volunteers in the exercises and duties pertaining to an effective soldiery.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ITALIAN PATRIOTISM FOR CONSTITUTIONAL', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ITALIAN PATRIOTISM FOR CONSTITUTIONAL', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a3cf2a52-42a4-5002-825f-72f2b866467a,366,nyt://article/a3cf2a52-42a4-5002-825f-72f2b866467a,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/07/30/archives/regimental-drills-protection-against-stampedes.html,,"In reviewing the causes of the recent disaster at Bull Run, it may be set down that we suffered most from two extremes of action -- the great cowardice and the great courage of regimental officers. All information concurs in the general statement that the held was full of brave men, but that they lost their officers, or lost sight of them, and became utterly disorganized; and so fled, as any great body of men will do in the presence of danger, when they lose the confidence of mutual support. The primary cause of confusion was the break of a regiment or two before a charge of cavalry. If these regiments had been well officered and thoroughly drilled, they, or the remnants of them, might have been re-formed on the field of battle. But there was no rallying point and no recuperative power in these regiments, and when once broken they scattered wildly and spread the contagion in every direction. First one, then another was involved in the tumult, till an entire division of the Army became a flying mob. In the mixed and miscellaneous herd, so many broken regiments and companies conspiring to swell the retreating column, no officer was generally enough known to effect a rally, and so the flight continued. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently in proof that individuals, not by virtue of their command as officers at all, did here and there induce small bodies of men to make a stand and pour steady and effective volleys into the pursuing enemy. These few exceptions were men evidently formed by nature for leaders, and their achievements show that we had true men enough in the fight, but that they were literally driven from the field from the lack of good leadership, and courageous and skillful handling.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Regimental Drills Protection against Stampedes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Regimental Drills Protection against Stampedes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a47212e2-a293-5b0a-b06d-0bd8a15995ae,606,nyt://article/a47212e2-a293-5b0a-b06d-0bd8a15995ae,

He considered he had been rather unfortunately treated by the honorable member for Liskeard and the honorable member for Galway, the other evening when he introduced this subject, who treated his statements as old women's tales. The noble lord, however, partly bore out what he stated. But to get at the facts he wrote to the United States for information, and in reply he received an act passed in the end of May by Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS and the parliament of the Confederate States, which completely confirmed what he said. He had stated that $20 had been offered for every person dead or alive. It appealed, however, that $25 was the sum offered, and that was the only mistake he made. He was right therefore in calling these people of the South and this Mr. J. DAVIS a set of brutes. [Laughter.] He also complained that a British Consul in the Confederate States neglected to do his duty by British subjects, and he wished to know whether the noble lord had received any communication upon that matter. He had himself received a communication at the last moment, stating that four or five Englishmen who had arrived in New-York, and were on their way to this country, complained that they had not obtained from British Consuls in the Southern States that protection to which they were entitled. They said they had experienced the inutility of a protection of those Consuls. With regard to the case of the tarring and feathering of the Captain of a British vessel, to which he alluded on a former occasion, he was informed that the British Consul at Savannah was present during that occurrence, and wore the secession colors. Surely, that was inconsistent with the neutrality which the English Government had declared they would observe. [Hear, hear.] When a reward was offered for the apprehension of the guilty parties, the ring-leader gave himself up and claimed the reward, and and after being subjected to two or three days' imprisonment was liberated. He (Mr. DUNCOMBE) understood, moreover, that the British Consul at Savannah was a large slave-owner in right of his wife, and, therefore, had a direct interest in the question which agitated the country.

BANKS at Harper's Ferry, or against Gen. ROSECRANS or Cox in Western Virginia. A decided offensive demonstration or movement, we have already shown to be a necessity imposed by their late victory; they must prove this to be something more than a mere repulse of the National forces. They must treat it as a great success in its results, as well as upon the field of battle. To leave it unimproved would be to throw away all its moral effects. The appropriate trophy would be the possession of Washington. In the conviction of the rebels it would secure the triumph of their cause. With such an inducement, and with the belief that we are yet demoralized by our defeat, what is there more probable than an attack upon our capital, so concerted as to cut us off from all communication through Baltimore, and to excite the disloyal sentiment in Maryland to open rebellion, which for the moment would greatly aid their operations, and probably add very materially to their military strength? Although Maryland is nominally loyal, a pretext or occasion may only be wanting to set the whole State in flames. We should count upon no different event. With the Confederates, in force, upon its soil, they may feel assured of such cooperation, whether they receive it or not. With the forces at their command, with the confidence inspired by their late victory, and with the strength of motive they have for the capture of Washington, an attack on that city is not improbable, whatever may be the result. We can hardly believe it could be successful; but the rebels, reasoning from entirely different premises, and possessing great superiority of numbers, may count its capture an easy affair.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Movements of the Rebels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Movements of the Rebels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-07-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ed1bd45-26d4-54fd-9b0d-2982b66c4f35,452,nyt://article/5ed1bd45-26d4-54fd-9b0d-2982b66c4f35,
