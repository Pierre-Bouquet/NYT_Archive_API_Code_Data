",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/01/archives/our-position-six-weeks-after-the-great-defeat.html,,"Six weeks ago to-day our Grand army defending the Capital, sustained a great defeat -- a rout, which was in the highest degree discreditable to its leadership, and to the discipline, rather than to the personal courage of the soldiers. In our flight we left prisoners, cannon, arms and military stores -- all the trophies of a victory -- in the hands of the enemy. It was the first great battle of the campaign, and the result would naturally be taken as evidence of the relative degree of military skill and prowess of the combatants. Nothing, apparently, was left to the North to disprove this evidence, but another battle and a victory so signal that it could have resulted only from a decided superiority in everything that can contribute to success. No such battle has been fought, yet we have so far recovered our ground about Washington that we may select our own time for renewing the fight, with a conviction that we are every day growing stronger and stronger, while it is manifest that the enemy must speedily win another victory or suffer the worst consequences of a disastrous defeat. The only effect upon ourselves of our disaster, was to call out such portion of our reserve power as will, to every reasonable mind, give us an immense preponderance and assure us the victory in the next contest. Previous to the Bull Run affair we had hardly touched our resources, in means and men. It was a fight upon which we had blundered, and in which no considerable portion of our strength was engaged. It disclosed enough to show why we lost when we might have won the victory. Our people have already repaired its effects by the preparations which they have been quietly, but vigorously, making to renew the contest, and which have placed us in the position we should have been in, before venturing to assail the rebel position. We have put another General at the head of our Army, whose previous successes in the war pointed him out as fitted to command. Public confidence was restored as to the ultimate success of our arms. He is earnestly and successfully occupied in correcting the errors and mistakes that led to our defeat. The whole Army had to be re-created. For this purpose we have put 100,000 new troops into the field, and added vastly to their efficiency by a better supplied Commissariat, a better subdivision of them into infantry, cavalry and artillery, and by their more complete appointment and equipment. Upon every strategical point we are accumulating vast, and what must soon be, overwhelming forces. The people, before the mortification and chagrin of a great defeat had been relieved by a single important success, have placed in the hands of Government abandant means for the vigorous prosecution of the war. With all such evidence of the extent of our resources, of our steadiness under defeat, and of our confidence in the permanency of our Government, we can well afford to select our own time for the commencement of offensive operations in Eastern Virginia, as every day only adds to our preparations for, and confidence of, victory.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Position Six Weeks after the Great Defeat.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Position Six Weeks after the Great Defeat.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2dd2fa3c-19e9-543e-947b-7fec5465b49e,1177,nyt://article/2dd2fa3c-19e9-543e-947b-7fec5465b49e,

As to the Day Book, an evening sheet, of the existence of which, as in the case of a very ancient and discreditable personage, one has no other evidence than an occasional rumor of its ill-doing, that also met its fate on the last day of August; not as in the instance of the others -- merely changing ownership, but suspending publication, if not permanently, at least so long as public safety requires its silence. There is little else to be done. The Brooklyn Eagle had previously repented, and is now doing its duty. The only malefactors yet extant are the Freeman's Journal and the Courier des Etats-Unis.

"If regulars fire twelve hundred bullets to kill one enemy, the muskets of volunteers can only be tormidable because they are the handles of bayonets, except at close quarters; that is to say, out of hand to hand reach and far within rifle range an intermediate distance wherein the greenest hand ought to hit half the time at least, and would do great execution if he could always have a charge in his piece.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/01/archives/arms-for-troops-of-the-line.html,,"If regulars fire twelve hundred bullets to kill one enemy, the muskets of volunteers can only be tormidable because they are the handles of bayonets, except at close quarters; that is to say, out of hand to hand reach and far within rifle range -- an intermediate distance wherein the greenest hand ought to hit half the time at least, and would do great execution if he could always have a charge in his piece. We have before referred to the fact that the grand defect of the muzzle-loading arm is, that it cannot be loaded rapidly enough. Men are repeatedly caught with their fire drawn in a position where they could mow down the enemy with the most unskillful aim; and, in most of these, cases they could load the best breech-loading arms on the run, or during the shortest halt. But putting a cartridge in at the muzzle, getting the ramrod in proper position, ramming the charge home down a foul barrel, replacing the ramrod and taking aim, besides the other necessary manipulations, is a process which requires time and room; and in the midst of a skirmish a volunteer is likely to have to trust to his bayonet or his heels after his first fire is drawn. The best breech-loading rifles, however, may be instantly opened at the breech by the hand that holds them, and charged, capped and shut by the other hand, without changing the position of the piece, on the run, or in the most confined quarters, or in some of the manoeuvres of a hand to hand skirmish; and shots at this range are pretty sure to be worth a hundred times as much as those of the rank and fire at rifle range. Nor does rapid loading, as is often urged, in the slightest degree facilitate careless firing, for the operation of aiming and pulling the trigger is quite irrespective of the manner of putting the cartridge in. The only objection of any importance against breech-loading muskets is that each bullet has to pass through the barrel after the latter has been fouled by the preceding charge, and that the accuracy of the shot is thus impaired. We do not know that this Objection holds in every case, and are sure that it will be remedied when it has proved a very serious evil; but we cannot see how it will impair the effectiveness of short range or hand-to-hand firing, even if it were so great as to quite prevent all execution at the long range which expert riflemen would select. It appears that the fouling of some of the muzzle-loaders was so great at Bull Run, that charges were with great difficulty rammed home after seven or eight rounds! If this is a type of musket practice, we might as well arm our regiments with spears or lances, or some cheaper kind of bayonet handle. No possible inaccuracy of range in a breech-loader could match such a defect in the muzzle-loader. The ramming home is done by the explosion itself; no more time is expended in loading a foul barrel than a clean one, and time, time, is the great question in loading. The arm of the professional rifleman, of course, has a very different office to perform. It is never to be used as a bayonet handle, but is simply and exclusively a hunting rifle; if the linen patch, rammed in under the bullet from the muzzle, cleans the barrel, and prevents all inaccuracy and wind-age, then the time required to load is of small importance, for sharp-shooting is the most leisurely of employments. Eight per cent. of the shots ought to tell at the longest distance at which a man can be distinctly seen, and none are expected to tell without they are deliberately aimed from a clean, heavy, and extremely well-made piece. It is the cautious, stealthy and quiet work of the hunter. But in the hands of the regular infantry, aiming must be done rapidly at the best; the soldier is trembling with the fatigue of the chase, or the excitement of close combat; his musket is alternately a gun, a club, a battering-ram and a lance; hence it cannot be heavy, so as to avoid recoil, nor long, so as to give the most accurate range, nor deliberately aimed, if it had every element of perfection as a gun. The best state it can be in is loaded, for it is then ready at the right instant for its best execution. And the only chance it has of being loaded, in nine out of ten cases, when a shot is most required, is to be breech-loading. Accuracy is of small importance compared with the time required to make a gun of it, instead of a spear, or a club.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Arms for Troops of the Line.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Arms for Troops of the Line.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bfbb867a-8a0b-5ad7-96e1-40409afdb3f9,1074,nyt://article/bfbb867a-8a0b-5ad7-96e1-40409afdb3f9,

The Cabinet of Washington, and the Americans of the North, show themselves, in general, deeply irritated at the hesitating attitude adopted by England in the pending civil war; and it must be confessed that the tone in which certain English journals have criticised the Manassas affair is not calculated to modify this impression. Two circumstances may change the amicable character of our relations with the United States: One is the intention announced by the Government of Washington, to collect the Customs duties on board of vessels lying off the ports now in possession of the Confederate authorities, (and assuredly England would resist this pretension, for the reason that we would probably have to pay double duties, viz.: at sea to the Unionists, and in the port to the Confederates;) the other is the design ascribed to Mr. LINCOLN, of declaring that the ports occupied by the rebels cease to be ports. At the first glance it is difficult to understand the policy of the latter project; but the intention seems to be to request the Captains of English vessels not to enter the ports in question, and, if they persist in doing so, to consider the act as an attempt to aid and sustain the rebels against the laws of the United States, which might bring about a rupture with Great Britain. It is highly probable that the one or the other of these eventualities will give rise to disputes between the two countries. The project of declaring that the ports of the South cease to be ports is almost an avowal that a real blockade does not exist; for if the entrance to these ports were strictly closed, seaward, what need of any such declaration? If, then, English ships are able to enter the ports in question, they will certainly do so, and the result may be many causes of conflict.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Official Views of the French and English Governments on the American Blockade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Official Views of the French and English Governments on the American Blockade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Correspondence of the Moniteur, Paris, Aug. 13', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Paris', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}, {'firstname': 'Aug', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 3}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/281a56fe-2adc-5b7b-b8a4-7434e40a27ef,328,nyt://article/281a56fe-2adc-5b7b-b8a4-7434e40a27ef,

Ever since the news arrived they have been lifting up their voices in one huge bray, and there is no telling when they will give over. It is not a bray of sympathy, of sorrow, or even of triumph. On the contrary, it is a highly moral bray, articulating lofty lessons for the advantage of all people, Englishmen especially. Yesterday we dealt with one of these big utterances, which had just been bellowed forth by the monarch of the race; to-day we pay our respects to the tamer creature which lowers its ears to the salutations of the dowager-duchesses and political flunkeys of Belgravia. Thus ruminates the Post: ""A Democratic Republic which, for warlike purposes, raises one hundred millions sterling in one year, and which imposes an income tax on real and personal property, is certainly a model which Englishmen ought neither to admire nor imitate."" Now, is not this asinine? We appeal to our readers, whether this stupid effusion left us a choice of similitudes. It is purely and outrageously donkeyish. We were not aware that a Democratic Republic of any sort ought to be admired, or imitated by Englishmen. We are satisfied with our Constitution, asking only that it be perfected and developed in harmony with its native spirit. We are attached to our monarchy, and should start at the idea of exchanging the throne for a President's chair. Are we to infer that, if we could only obtain solid guarantees against extravagant expenditure, the Post would go in for a ""Democratic Republic?"" But the sting of the objection is that this extravagant expenditure is raised for ""warlike purposes,"" -- we as a people loving peace so well that we never spent and never will spend a stiver upon armaments. Why, the objection is disarmed in stating it. The ""Democratic Republic"" over the water was never more like ourselves than it is now. Yesterday it was thrifty, economical, raising a miserable revenue, denying itself the luxury of a standing army and navy, except on a scale ridiculously small. To-day it has an army almost as big as the Queen of England maintains for the defence of her wide dominions, and it is spending maney on just such a lavish scale as we were only six years ago. The Americans and we are brethren at last; equally warlike, equally prodigal. Ah! but look at the burdens which this extravagant expenditure imposes upon the people. This Democratic Republic is actually levying an income tax on real and personal property!

Of course this involves a new theory of the law of nations, which he proceeds to develop. Whatever we may think of M. PROUDHON's ideas on politics or social economy, he remains an incomparable logician, one of the most vigorous thinkers of the age. All his books seem to be inspired by a deep love of humanity, and they should be so, for they have obtained the glorious seal of martyrdom. His disciples regard him as the master of the new politics, the prophet of modern society. While those who are not Frenchmen will hardly take this view of him and his work, his productions are of such a nature that if not absolutely true, they are, at least, well worth examining, to see what truth is in them.

Along the line of march through New-York, they were received with plaudits on all sides. It must be an unusual occurrence that calls out Broadway, and on this occasion that famous thoroughfare presented the appearance of a gala day. It was an elegant and well merited compliment, both to Col. COCHRANE and to Lieut.-Col. SHALER, and such an expression of public feeling must have been peculiarly gratifying to each of them. There is a remarkable circumstance connected with the march of the Chasseurs through New-York, and it should be recorded to the lasting honor of the regiment. In the entire battalion not a single man was intoxicated, not a single man left the line, and not a single man was absent at the next roll call. This, perhaps, can be said of no other body of soldiers that have marched to Washington since the war commenced. It should also be said that for men who but three days before had muskets placed in their hands as soldiers, the order observed was most creditable, and gave glowing promise of better things to come.

It appeared by the papers seized in Fort Hatteras that no less than fourteen vessels, some of them carrying exceedingly valuable cargoes, have been captured by the pirates, and carried in at Hatteras Inlet to be plundered.

And all within a hundred and twenty miles of Old Point Comfort, where we have had, since May, ships and men enough to blow them to pieces.

"The Government, through its financial representative, Mr. Secretary CHASE, has made its appeal to the people for aid in the great contest, in terms befitting the grandeur of the occasion.

The issue of Treasury Notes, paywable out of this fund. Would simply be cheeks against it precisely of the charaeter of those drawn by an ordinary depositor against his credits. A merchant going to Chicago or St. Louis, to make purchases of produce to the amount of $1,000,000, would take only a small portion of this sum in specie, as drafts upon New-York or Boston, or Philadelphia, would be worth to him more than specie, for exchange. If the Government should transport $5,000,000 in specie to St. Louis, to be paid out in military operations, the greater portion would speedily return to this City in the ordinary course of trude. The issue of an equal amount of Treasury Notes at St. Louis, would allow their equivalent in specie to remain on deposit, and maintain the amount held by the banks and Sub-Treasury at a uniform figure, avoiding in this way all anxiety about, or disturbance of the money market. The tendency of specie is always to the great centres, and if taken from, always returns to them. By leaving it in its proper place of deposit, and checking against it from all parts of the country, by an issue of Treasury notes, the operations of Government would harmonize with the public advantage, and save a great deal of expense and risk in the constant transmission of large sums of specie. An issue of Treasury Notes, to the amount of $20,000,000, would prevent an equal sum from being taken from the banks, to be kept moving from one point to another, or in the pockets of soldiers and officers, waiting some safe and convenient mode for transmission to their families. The withdrawal of so large a sum in coin from the vaults of the Banks could not fail to exert a very unfavorable influence over the money market and the operations of trade, no matter how probable its early return. The banks, as a matter of precaution, would always maintain a pretty uniform relation between their discounts and the amount of specie they held.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'United States Circulating Notes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'United States Circulating Notes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': ""From Hallet's American and European Circular"", 'person': [{'firstname': 'From', 'middlename': ""Hallet's"", 'lastname': 'American', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'European', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Circular', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4cbd7b0e-6f0d-5974-a456-fc8bfc902d5b,598,nyt://article/4cbd7b0e-6f0d-5974-a456-fc8bfc902d5b,

The London Times has for some time past devoted itself to this particular mode of attack upon the cause of the Union, as it has the advantage of inflicting what appears to be the maximum of damage with the least possible exposure of the assailant. To espouse in distinct terms the cause of the rebels; to advocate the acknowledgment of the Richmond Government; to recommend a disregard of the blockade, or the equipment of privateers, would expose, the Times to the charge of avowed sympathy with Slavery, and of substantially violating the neutrality laws. But, if it can dissuade the English capitalist from strengthening the pecuniary arm of the Northern war, while it leaves in freedom the Southern agents to effect what loans they can, the Times satisfies itself that it is as effectually promoting the overthrow of the Republic as if it gave to the insurgents ships, and men, and arms. And, as some evidence that its labors have not been unrewarded, it is to be remembered that, while the Washington Government has not gone nor had the thought to go into Lombard-street as a borrower of money, Southern negotiators have been there, and borne away large sums destined for the rebels. Witness the Bank of England bills found upon the man SERRELL, now a prisoner at Fort Lafayette, and those drafts of the Messrs. BARING found a few days since at the Park Bank. In other words, the lessons of the Times have really had their effect upon the British moneyed classes, who have never been disposed to look with favor upon American institutions or credit, because taught by mischievous instructors to regard repudiation as a cardinal doctrine of democracy, and to hold the National Treasury answerable for the deficiencies of Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/05/archives/credulity-of-the-croakers.html,,"-- The carping croakers in our midst, who can see nothing but corruption in the Government, and ultimate defeat for the Union cause, exhibit the most remarkable credulity. They see insurmountable financial obstacles in the path of 20,000,000 of people engaged in trade and commerce, with the money markets of the world open to them, and yet believe that 10,000,000 of an agricultural people, hemmed in by land and sea, with no national existence in the money market, and celebrated for repudiation, will have money plenty. They imagine that the North, with a superabun dance of fighting material of every kind -- of men, of arms, of ammunition, of clothing, of provisions and of medical stores, will be obliged to succumb to the South, which lacks all these essential requisites -- is suffering for nearly all of the luxuries and many of the necessaries of life -- is obliged to resort to drafting and conscription to procure men, robbery to procure food and clothing, and lying to prop a falling cause, The croakers see nothing but defeat for the North upon the sea, when every Southern port is blockaded, and the cowardly privateers are daily dodging the United States cruisers. The growlers discern death for the Union cause, in the defeat at Bull Run or at Springfield, Mo., but they can observe no damage to the rebel cause in the capture of PEGRAM and his forces, or the occupation of the forts at Hatteras Inlet. They grumble and groan and bewail every National loss, and rejoice at every rebel gain, forgetting that the defeat of the North is their own disgrace. In short, they delude themselves into believing that a nation of Northern hardy freemen, with men, money, all the paraphernalia of war, means of transportation by land and sea, and the sympathies of the world, besides justice and humanity, on their side, are to be defeated by a disorganized band of traitors of half their number, lacking the main essentials for successful warfare, cooped up like so many caged birds, and fighting against all the dictates of law, reason and humanity, with a population almost equal to their own ripe for insurrection.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CREDULITY OF THE CROAKERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CREDULITY OF THE CROAKERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a56b243-9121-5bc1-b449-bffbdef4c499,363,nyt://article/4a56b243-9121-5bc1-b449-bffbdef4c499,

"Gen. BUTLER gives very cogent reasons why we should hold the forts on Hatteras Inlet, ""the key of the Albemarle,"" as the rebel engineer there called it. But it is a great mistake to suppose, as has been stated, that these give us complete command of the whole of Pamlico Sound. To obtain possession of this and the adjoining waters there are three other points which it is absolutely necessary to hold, and it is a great pity that Gen. BUTLER and Commodore STRINGHAM, before returning to the pleasures of speechifying and receiving serenades, did not take the responsibility to secure them. There is, first, Oregon or New Inlet, about forty miles north of Cape Hatteras; an inlet that, like Hatteras, is of modern origin, having been formed by the tides, but affording five feet water at high tide -- quite sufficient to allow shoals of the light-draught piratical crew to issue forth. Next there is Ocracoke, which is about twelve miles southwest of Hatteras Inlet, and which the rebels have defended by a fort on Beacon Island, where there was some time ago a battery of 32-pounders, eight in number, but probably greatly strengthened since their loss. In a military point of view its possession is equally important as that of Hatteras Inlet, as it affords an easy entrance to Pamlico Sound and its numerous tributaries. Through this inlet vessels from Tarborough, Greenville, and Washington on the Pamlico River, and Waynesborough, Goldsborough, and Newbern on the Neuse River, have been in the habit of proceeding to sea carrying aid and comfort to the enemy at will. Lastly there is Beaufort, N.C., which it is absolutely necessary we get possession of. It is only by holding these three points, in addition to Hatteras, that we can be said really to command Pamlico Sound and the contiguous waters and shores. This effectually seals up the enemy and gives us control of nearly three hundred miles of coast, up to the present time the secure rendezvous for piratical expeditions. It will also deprive the enemy of that valuable internal commerce by means of which they have been enabled to supply Virginia on the one hand and North Carolina on the other. Privateers will no longer be able to reach the sea through the Dismal Swamp Canal and Albemarle Sound to annoy our commerce. Moreover, we can assemble inside of the outer coast hundreds of light-draught steamers and sailing vessels, and whenever we are ready we may throw an Army upon the main land and establish a military footing in North Carolina. In fact, an article in the Petersburgh Express of Sept. 2 admits that ""the whole of the eastern part of the State is now exposed to the ravages of the merciless vandals. Newbern, Washington, Plymouth, Edenton, Hertford, Elizabeth City, are all now exposed, besides the whole of the adjacent country."" These results are predicated on our obtaining possession of the three points we have indicated. Without these the light-draught vessels which have been continually annoying the Government by bringing in supplies to the rebels, and the privateers who prey on our commerce, will continue their nefarious traffic. Even as we write we have confirmations of both these facts. The Captain of a schooner, which arrived at this port yesterday morning from Baracoa, (a seaport on the northeastern coast of Cuba,) reports that on the 1st inst., when sixty miles east of Cape Hatteras, his vessel was chased by a privateer schooner, but escaped; and a late copy of the Richmond Dispatch informs us of the arrival of two vessels from Liverpool at Beaufort, N.C., laden with arms, ammunition, thread, quicksilver, etc.!",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/05/archives/the-projected-naval-expeditions-three-points-we-must-have.html,,"Gen.

The assertion is partly true. We did urge the Government to push forward the attack upon the rebels with greater vigor and energy than they were then showing, -- and we insisted also on the absolute necessity of compelling them to evacuate Virginia, and of surrendering Richmond, which they had made the capital of their bogus Confederacy. But we did not urge an advance upon Richmond by way of Manassas. On the contrary, we repeatedly warned the Government against allowing the rebels to dictate the time and place of battle. We remonstrated against a policy which would permit the South to collect their whole force in Virginia, and there, with their consolidated armies, meet any attack we might make upon them. What we urged, was that our Government, leaving a sufficient force at Washington to render it secure against attack, should use the Navy to make attacks upon the Southern seacoast, -- to harass and destroy the rebel forces in the very States which had been the seat of the original rebellion. This policy, we insisted, would compel them to withdraw their troops from Virginia, in order to provide for the defence of the menaced Gulf States. North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, each would have been under the absolute necessity of recalling all her own troops to defend her own coasts. Virginia would thus have been thrown wholly and entirely upon her own resources, -- and the path to Richmond would have been open and free to our troops from Washington.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': '""ON TO RICHMOND.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '""ON TO RICHMOND.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f5754220-0679-59aa-832a-789479a15965,470,nyt://article/f5754220-0679-59aa-832a-789479a15965,

Yet the strength and elements of prosperity still retained will, when fully understood, be a marvel to the world, and are a most striking proof that the North, previous to the rebellion, constituted the wealth and real power of the country. There never was an instance in which a civil war, dividing a country nearly in twain, injured one portion so little and the other so much. The reason is to be found in the fact that the Northern States form a complete and rounded people in themselves, so thoroughly independent of the others that the civil war in which they are engaged does not, for a moment, compare in its onerousness, or in its disastrous consequences, with one with any respectable European power. In its effect upon the trade of the country, it is as if a certain and inconsiderable portion of it had disappeared, leaving unimpaired all the elements of its prosperity. The loss so far can be easily calculated. The reduction of the rebellion may be an expensive affair, but as soon as we have recovered our self-possession, the expenditures incurred will operate to recover the business of the country from the torpor into which it had fallen. The progress of population in the Northern States will, in a few years, with the entire cessation of that of the South, give us a trade equal in value to that we ever possessed. No hostile foot of a rebel in arms has ever trod the free soil of the North. No one of its citizens has, on account of the war, had to forego any accustomed avocation. All its internal routes of commerce have been uninterrupted, and were never more thronged with traffic than since the outbreak.

The Committee of loyal citizens offered to give them one if they would raise it. This offer they declined to accept, and positively refused to have a flag on the church. Last Saturday night the Committee procured a flag and placed it on the highest point of the church. The pastor and several members of the congregation were indgnant when they saw what had been done, and threatened to remove the obnoxious emblem.

LATSON, of the Horse Artillery, encamped at Staten Island, and of his discharge. Col. LATSON, under the advice of Judge BIRDSALL, after his discharge, proceeded to ascertain the immediate cause of his persecutions. He learned that DANIEL H. BURTNETT, who represents himself as ""Major Commanding the Coast Brigade at Fortress Monroe,"" ingratiated himself with the officers of Col. LATSON's Staff, and stirred up the difficulties with a view of superseding Col. L. in command of the said Artillery. Having learned these facts, he inquired into BURTNETT's history, and learned that he, BURTNETT, at the time the mob collected at the Daily News Office, took the American Flag and concealed it under a sofa, and then drew a pistol and threatened to shoot any person who interfered to take it, or force the proprietors to hoist the flag; also, that BURTNETT has been holding secret correspondence with Gen. BEAUREGARD, through his (Gen. B.'s) sister, who resides in Union-square; also that he (BURTNETT) was concerned in carrying on communication with the rebel Army from Fortress Monroe, by a secret telegraphic wire which he had assisted in laying from that post. These facts, by advice of the District-Attorney, were reduced to form in the office of Judge BIRDSALL, and were ready to be sworn to yesterday at 4 1/2 o'clock P.M., when BURTNETT, accompanied by GEORGE W. MEAD, Quartermaster in Col. LATSON's Staff, and three others, entered Judge BIRDSALL's office, closed and fastened the doors, drew four revolving pistols, and presented one to the head of the Colonel, saying ""I will give you one minute for your life,"" and then, turning to a brother of the Judge, who was engaged in drawing the papers, said, ""You d -- d scoundrels, you're concerned in this as well as LATSON,"" and snatched all the papers from his hand. Terror-stricken by the five men with drawn pistols, he begged to be released from the ruffians. Having been released, he left the place and went in search of an officer; the armed men went away with the papers and all the evidence of his (BURTNETT's) treason. The parties were subsequently all arrested, upon a warrant issued by Justice KELLY, and were committed in default of bail.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""COL.

Only a few weeks ago expressions of the profoundest despondency were on every lip, and discouraged almost every patriotic movement. It was doubted whether men and money could be had to prosecute the war. Men began to accustom themselves to the worst alternative offered by an unsuccessful contest and a humiliating peace; and for a moment it seemed that the cause was likely to be sacrificed, not because the people were not in earnest, but because they could not discover in those administering the Government any sympathy with their earnestness and its aims. The events which have followed the stern lesson learned at Bull Run have almost entirely dispelled this general sentiment of despair, and replaced it with one of wholesome and amply authorized hopefulness. We now know that the Administration has some realization of the occasion and its requirements. It has entered upon a new and more active course; and it has only to persevere in the same direction, and with the same desire to exert the full powers conferred upon it by the people, to reach a triumphant result.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Vigor of Government Need of Fixed Rules of Action.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Vigor of Government Need of Fixed Rules of Action.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2cbdb8f-e03e-5827-94eb-9cdce01fb67d,909,nyt://article/d2cbdb8f-e03e-5827-94eb-9cdce01fb67d,

So much of the history of 1861 as is thus far written, is indisputable proof of the charge. With what assurance did we set out that there would be no rebellion; that a large majority of the South would remain neutral; that the rebels would be unable to set an Army a-field; that the blockade would at once settle the business; that provisions and supplies would fail them before the end of Summer; that the Slaves would at once burst into insurrection; that the enemy would never meet our armies in the field, or, venturing upon the encounter, would at once scatter like sheep; and so on through scores of irrational assumptions, which were momentary causes of our exultation, which the event converted into an equally unreasonable despondency. Then came fears quite as foundationless. Washington would be captured; Philadelphia and New-York were hardly safe; the seas would be presently swarming with an armada of privateers; England and France would deny any recognition of the blockade, or acknowledging it, would find an early pretence to break it; that they would insist on the opening of a cotton port; and so through a wearisome procession of fantastic apprehensions, which there has been no subsequent fact to justify. It is superfluous to recite the evidence of our changeable temper as a people. It is simply the diary of eight months of action and excitement. But in making the review, in the penitent temper which becomes us, let us claim that our experience has not been wholly thrown away, but that to-day the settled confidence which has become general is not based upon senseless miscalculations of our relative strength or weakness, or of the attitude assumed by the leading Powers of Europe; but upon a just, rational and trustworthy estimate of the entire situation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Lessons of the Summer.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Lessons of the Summer.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/063449c5-7116-55df-acb1-cf5782bdab69,974,nyt://article/063449c5-7116-55df-acb1-cf5782bdab69,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/09/archives/newjersey.html,,"FIRE, EXPLOSION AND LOSS OF LIFE. -- Between 7 and 8 o'clock, on Saturday night, a fire broke out on board the schooner Cornelia, of New-Bedford, which resulted in the destruction of a large amount of property, the death of one man and the serious injury of two others. The vessel was lying at the Paterson dock, foot of Wayne-street, adjoining the depot of the New-Jersey Railroad, and was loaded with 800 barrels of kerosene oil. An explosion occurred in the hold of the schooner, and she was almost instantly enveloped in flames, and the fire rapidly spread to the dock, setting fire to three cars loaded with wheat. The shed covering the dock, and the cars, with their contents, were completely destroyed; but before this the vessel was burned to the water's edge. The Fire Department of Jersey City, assisted by three companies from New-York, made every effort to stay the progress of the fire, and it is believed, but for their exertions the depot of the New-Jersey Railroad would have been destroyed. The fire raged with great violence until nearly 12 o'clock, and at many times a destructive conflagration seemed imminent. At the time of the explosion there were three persons on board the schooner, ENAS DOUGLASS, the steward; FRANK SILVEY, and a boy named EMANUEL, 15 years of age. They were all seriously injured, and only escaped from the burning vessel by jumping overboard, when they were rescued by the hands on the Jersey City Ferry. They were taken to the Almshouse and placed in charge of Mr. WHITLEY, the Superintendent of that institution. Medical attendance was promptly procured, and the injured persons received every attention. At 9 o'clock yesterday morning DOUGLASS died from the effect of his injuries, but the other two, though seriously, it is believed are not fatally injured. Coroner GAFFNEY held an inquest on the body of DOUGLASS, but could not elicit any information as to the origin of the fire. It is believed to have resulted from spontaneous combustion. The report that deceased went into the hold of the vessel with a lighted candle is not only highly improbable, but is denied in the most positive manner by SILVEY. The verdict of the Coroner's Jury was that the deceased came to his death from an explosion on board the schoner Cornelia, and from the effect of internal burns. DOUGLASS leaves a wife and two children resident in New-Bedford. The total loss caused by the fire will probably exceed $50,000. The schooner belonged to the Captain, GEO. CRASSO. His loss is $3,000, covered by insurance. The cargo belonged to RICHARDSON & Co., of New-York. Loss $12,000; no insurance. The cars destroyed belonged to the New-York and Erie Railroad Company, whose loss is about $9,000, partly insured.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-Jersey.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-Jersey.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9895f138-8933-54bd-825f-28121464be40,490,nyt://article/9895f138-8933-54bd-825f-28121464be40,

The story is managed on the principle of light and shade; -- the contrusts of character are as marked as they could possibly be drawn. Thus we have a confirmed misanthrope placed side by side with a practical philanthropist; a sullen, reserved and unnatural youth in close juxtaposition with a bright and joyous one. The plot of the story seems to have never been very clearly determined in the author's mind previous to its conclusion, action and dialogue scarcely keep pace with each other, and too many characters are introduced to allow any one of them to play a very prominent part; nor is the conclusion of the novel very satisfactory. A mysterious recluse is introduced, but the mystery shrouding him is never thoroughly explained. His life was embittered by an unjust will, but why that will was made in the first place, or why no attempt was subsequently made to set it aside, all this the reader is left to determine to his own satisfaction. Perhaps, however, it is the intention of the author to publish a sequel, in which all these things will be made plain. The interest of the book is well maintained from the first chapter to the last, and the reader will not be likely to lay it aside until he reaches the colophon.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/99c515bc-74f5-5acf-813c-e9831c6254b5,1341,nyt://article/99c515bc-74f5-5acf-813c-e9831c6254b5,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/09/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"DEDICATION OF SAINT ANNE'S CHURCH. -- There was a large and appreciative audience present at the dedication of Saint Anne's Roman Catholic Church, Brooklyn, yesterday forenoon. The church is located at the corner of Front and Gold streets, and is a most elegant, costly and tasteful structure, in every respect creditable to the taste of the architect, Mr. KEELY, of Brooklyn, and to the directing church authorities. The pastor of the church is Rev. Father B. GLEASON, who has become generally popular by his services to his congregation. The church contains about two hundred pews, and will seat nearly one thousand persons. There are seven windows of stained glass upon each side, each a gift, bearing the giver's name. These are generally ornamented in the most tasteful and gorgeous manner. Three of these windows bear representations of saints -- one of St. Anne, one of St. Joseph, and the third of St. Bridget. The central window, above the altar, contains a representation of the Virgin Mary and the child Jesus, and was the gift of the sailors belonging to the North Carolina. The altar is of solid marble, set off with magnificent decorations. In the rear of the altar are paintings representing St. Peter, St. John, and the Adoration of the Angels. One of the most costly and elegant ornaments of the church is a statue of St. Patrick in marble. The church roof or dome is supported in the centre by a series of arches based upon heavy posts or pillars. Between the several windows and set in the wall, are fourteen representations in basso relievo, of Scripture scenes. These are in each case surrounded by beautifully ornamented frameworks. Three pieces of diminutive marble statuary in the rear of the altar add to the taste of its appearance. The roof and arches of the building are gorgeously adorned with kaleidoscopic figures, no less than fifteen or twenty different shades of colors being used in the paintings of the walls and windows. The services usual upon such occasions commenced at 10 1/2 o'clock. There were present Bishop LOUGHLIN, Father MOONEY, (Chaplain of the Sixty-ninth Regiment,) Rev. Father MALONE, of Williamsburgh; Rev. Father J.P. CAHILL, of Albany; Father MCCARTY, of New-York, and Father FAGAN, of Brooklyn. Also Fathers MCCAHILL and KEEGAN -- the latter deacon and the former sub-deacon. Father J.R. MCDONALD acted as Master of Ceremonies upon the occasion. The sermon was preached by Bishop LOUGHLIN, and was a timely and eloquent discourse. Mass was celebrated -- Mercadante in four parts; offertory, Quamdelecta and Veni Sancti. The principal singers present, especially for these services, were Madame VON BERKEL, soprano; Miss GOMRIEN, alto; M. WEINLICH, bass, and M. FREDEL, tenor. The principal singer of the permanent choir is Miss PAGENDARM, soprano, whose merit in Brooklyn is by no means unappreciated. The ceremonies were generally impressive, and lasted about two and a-half hours.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f03b736b-7eb8-518d-8333-70e60997cb87,592,nyt://article/f03b736b-7eb8-518d-8333-70e60997cb87,

"As the outbreak of the rebellion found its leaders a coalition for active operations, with definiteness of purpose and unity of counsels, the result of years of preparations, during which they had exclusive possession of the Government, which they believed they had so thoroughly undermined by corrupting the loyalty of a large number of its officers as to render it incapable of any vigorous action for its permanence or safety, their policy was clearly that of a vigorous offensive, and to strike an overwhelming blow before any effectual resistance could be offered. Up to the bombardment of Fort Sumter the hands of the Government were tied by the sentiment of a large party at the North against coercion. At that moment the rebels were relatively stronger than they have been at any subsequent one. They had an excitable population which could, by appeals to their pride, their love of power and hatred to the North, be called, in mass, almost instantly into the field, and in a condition well fitted for any enterprise which had a smack of hazard, or one in which the dash which distinguishes Southern character would be a good substitute for military training. Both their internal and foreign commerce were entirely free. Not a single industry had been interrupted. If they did not have the sympathy of foreign Powers, they certainly impressed them with the conviction they thus could not be put down by any force that Government could exact.

"Were England at this moment to announce to the world its intention to make the speediest possible conquest of France, or were France to make the same declaration as to England, the world would laugh at the egregious folly that had inspired the design and prompted the boast. The world would grant that, supposing either people to be infatuated enough, and obstinate enough, it could inflict enormous and irreparable injuries on the other, but only at the cost of equal injuries to itself. The ball once, started, Fortune might befriend this side or that; it might give to either great victories or periods of advantage; it might even place one eventually over the head of the other, but still only at a cost utterly out of proportion to the value of the miserable result. Now, that is the case of two Confederates across the Atlantic, where the surviving half of an effete Federal Union has undertaken to reduce the other half to its Federal duties. We say that this is the case, but before we proceed a step further, it is necessary to observe that the case of the Northern Americans is in some important respects more difficult than ours would be. They are not so united as we have always found ourselves in war. Their Border States feel a divided allegiance. They have to protect more than a thousand miles of land frontier, including one closely beleagured position surrounded by foes or ill-affected adherents. Speaking the same language as their foe, they have no means of excluding spies from their lines, or even traitors from their ranks. They have to make a standing Army and a fleet. They have to learn the first elements of tactics, and even military discipline. They are without soldiers, or officers to command and to train them. Their revenue, at its best, before the war, was only just sufficient to meet the interest of the debt likely to be incurred by two years of the war on its present scale. That revenue, however, is, to begin with, maimed by the loss of the seceders and by the stoppage of traffic, so that it is questionable whether it will be possible to do more than repair that loss by the new taxes now imposed. American credit is not so good as British, nor is the credit of a Federal Union in process of dissolution likely to be equal to that of a united people. Lastly, war, which changes its character according to circumstances, establishes special rules of probability for different localities. The one rule established by all American warfare is that the advantage is on the side of the defence. Our offensive operations always failed against fortified positions, against breastworks thrown up in a night, against forests full of an invisible foe; against heat, hunger and thirst; against the ever imminent flank attack; against the certainty that every step diminished the number, the strength and the munitions of our own men, and increased those of the enemy. The present war might, for its incidents, be a chapter in our own disastrous wars on that soil. The Northerners have advanced upon a fortified position, but a day's march from Washington. They have arrived at the point with a force already melting away, far short of the list on paper, beaten with heat, hunger, thirst and a long march, and surprised on both flanks by the sudden outpourings of railways. While this has occurred in Virginia, almost within sight of Washington, a column of 8,000 Federalists, advancing against a foe thrice their number, has met with the same fate, no doubt for much the same reasons, at Springfield, four or five hundred miles to the West, -- as if in order to warn the Northern States that what has happened is no accident, no result of peculiar circumstances or personal failure, but by inevitable rule.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/11/archives/the-london-times-on-the-war-impossibility-of-restoring-the-union.html,,"Were England at this moment to announce to the world its intention to make the speediest possible conquest of France, or were France to make the same declaration as to England, the world would laugh at the egregious folly that had inspired the design and prompted the boast.

The present war might, for its incidents, be a chapter in our own disastrous wars on that soil. The Northerners have advanced upon a fortified position, but a day's march from Washington. They have arrived at the point with a force already melting away, far short of the list on paper, beaten with heat, hunger, thirst and a long march, and surprised on both flanks by the sudden outpourings of railways. While this has occurred in Virginia, almost within sight of Washington, a column of 8,000 Federalists, advancing against a foe thrice their number, has met with the same fate, no doubt for much the same reasons, at Springfield, four or five hundred miles to the West, -- as if in order to warn the Northern States that what has happened is no accident, no result of peculiar circumstances or personal failure, but by inevitable rule.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LONDON TIMES ON THE WAR.; IMPOSSIBILITY OF RESTORING THE UNION.

In our strait we expected sympathy and a hearty wish for our success. To our astonishment, we found that for the past forty years the hostile sentiments always imputed to the ruling classes in England, in reference to the United States, had only remained in abeyance, overlaid by commercial relations, and had gathered strength instead of being weakened by a long period of repose.

"The Confederate troops, without provocation advanced from Tennessee into Kentucky, and seized the town of Hickman and a place called Chalk Bluffs in the immediate vicinity of Columbus, and went to erecting fortifications at both points.

"The leaders of the Southern rebellion have counted much on the demonstrations in their favor, to be furnished by the elections in the Northern States. They have been looking for evidences of sympathy on a large scale in their favor. They reckoned that the people would be disheartened by the desperate nature of the conflict, and frightened by the burthens which the war would necessarily impose upon them. The elections in Maine and Vermont have been held. There was but one party in either State, and that in favor of a vigorous and energetic prosecution of the war.

Machade, on a charge of fitting out the bark Mary Francis from this port of the Slave-trade, was commenced yesterday before United States Commissioner OSBORNE. The Mary Francis sailed from this port on the 17th of October last for Wilmington, N.C., whence she sailed ostensibly for one of the West India Islands, but as it afterwards turned out, proceeded direct for the Coast of Africa, where she took on a cargo of negroes, and subsequently landed them on the Island of Cuba. Thus much is susceptible of abundant proof already in the hands of the Government, but who fitted the vessel out, and in whose interest she sailed on her slave trading expedition is more difficult to establish. Mr. Machado was arrested some two or three weeks ago charged with fitting out not only the Mary Francis, but half-a-dozen other slavers that are known to have sailed from this port during the last five years. On his first examination, he was discharged for want of proof, the Government witness having failed to arrive from Boston, and the counsel for Mr. Machado, stated at the time that his [???] would hold himself in readiness for examination whenever called for, and would voluntarily surrender himself without putting the District Attorney to the trouble of arresting him. In accordance with this agreement, Mr. Machado, on learning that the witnesses for the Government had arrived, voluntarily appeared at the examination, accompanied by his counsel, Judge Bebee. Mr. Andrews appeared on behalf of the Government, and called to the stand Wm. Murray, who testified that he was a sailor on board the Mary Francis; shipped at this port on the 15th of October last, and sailed on the 17th for Wilmington; on the night the vessel sailed saw a man on the dock who looked very like Machado, but couldn't swear it was he; vessel lay at Pier No. 52 East River; witness shipped as a sailor at French's office in South-street; was thirteen days on the passage to Wilmington; stopped at Wilmington seven days, during which time they discharged some empty barrels, and took in half a cargo of lumber, and filled some water casks; Williams, who was master of the bark when she left New-York, left her two days after they arrived at Wilmington, and Capt. Parker took his place; while lying in the stream at Wilmington the day the bark sailed, Mr. Machado came on board, accompanied by Mrs. Watson; spent most of the time in the cabin with the captain; didn't hear any of the conversation; witness and another sailor took them ashore in a boat.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Slaver Mary Francis.; UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE Before Commissioner Osborne."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Slaver Mary Francis.; UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE Before Commissioner Osborne."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3aef328b-65d5-509e-af5e-2ad935f29c9a,462,nyt://article/3aef328b-65d5-509e-af5e-2ad935f29c9a,

The command of the rebel FLOYD, consisting of five thousand men, has been ignominiously routed, leaving behind them all their camp equipage, wagons, horses, large quantities of ammunition, fifty head of cattle -- in fact, everything, even to the personal baggage of FLOYD and his officers. The rebel army was found by Gen. ROSECRANS to be intrenched in a powerful position on the top of a mountain at Cannix Ferry, near Summerville, on the west side of Gauley River, and, after suitable reconnoissances, an engagement commenced at 3 o'clock, on Tuesday afternoon. FLOYD had sixteen field pieces, and his rear and both flanks were, from the nature of the ground, inaccessible, while his front was masked with heavy forest and a close jungle. Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, the success of our arms was complete, and with a comparatively small loss of life. The enemy's position was first discovered by four companies from the Ohio Tenth Regiment, acting as scouts, who unexpectedly came upon a parapet battery, and a long line of palisades for riflemen, when the battle opened with great fierceness, and continued until dark. The Tenth, Twelfth and Thirteenth Ohio were immediately brought into action, and engaged the batteries with good effect, while MCMULLIN's howitzer batteries and two field-pieces were got into position, and succeeded in silencing several of the enemy's guns. The battle raged furiously as night approached, and the German Brigade, under Col. MCCOOK, was brought up, soon after which the firing ceased, on account of the darkness, and the troops lay in position on their arms, ready to resume operations with the morning light. During the night, however, the rebels fled precipitately across the river, leaving everything behind them, and destroying the temporary bridge which they had constructed, so that pursuit was impossible, the river at that point being deep and turbulent. The National loss is but fifteen killed and about seventy wounded. The loss of the rebels is not known, as they carried their dead and wounded with them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/400c430f-0795-5274-b306-d054f4020c21,1445,nyt://article/400c430f-0795-5274-b306-d054f4020c21,

Mr. BEND made a statement of the prices, and said that next morning, at 10 o'clock, the notes could be delivered. At the time mentioned, CLEMENTS returned to the office, and presented to the complainant another letter from BARKER & SONS, containing a check for $2,466 93, in favor of LIVERMORE, CLEWS & MASON, purporting to have been certified by the Cashier of the Bank of Jersey City. In consideration of this check, five $500 Treasury notes were delivered to CLEMENTS, who went away. The check was placed in the Bank of the Commonwealth for collection, when it was found, upon presenting it at the Bank of Jersey City, that the certification upon the check was a forgery, and that BARKER & SONS kept no account there.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/13/archives/decline-of-party-spirit.html,,"Among the results of the present war is the disintegration of political parties all over the country. Party platforms, differences on questions of governmental policy belonging to the past, have all been swept away by the rush of events, or buried beneath the living issues of the present. Party rallying cries have lost their potency; party discipline has ceased to be regarded. Nobody talks about the ""Chicago platform."" Nobody thinks of the Baltimore resolutions. ""Popular Sovereignty"" and ""Slavery expansion ""have ceased to be discussed. Whether a citizen was last year a Democrat, a Republican, a Union conservative, is no longer a subject of thought or inquiry. The practical question is: What are his opinions Now -- to-day, on the subject of the crisis through which the country is passing? and where does he stand in reference to an uncompromising and vigorous prosecution of the war, until the Union shall be reinstated in its length and breadth, and the Constitution vindicated in all its sanctions? Such are now the tests of political orthodoxy, and they are rapidly relaxing the cohesiveness of political organizations. Men of all parties and of every subdivision of party are standing side by side in the ranks of the Army, periling their lives in defence of the country without inquiry as to the political faith of either, and the people seeing this, ask why those who remain at home should not go to the polls together as the soldiers go to the war, and vote as the soldiers fight, for the preservation of the Union, without reference to past political associations or sympathies. Loyalty to the Constitution is everywhere acknowledged as of infinitely higher obligation than fealty to party. Though ancient leaders may attempt to stem the current thus setting in towards the demolition of political organizations, yet they are swept away by the resistless rush. ""Who cares for party now, when the Constitution is in danger, and the Union imperiled? The question whether we have a country or not, is the first in order. Let us settle that, and we will talk about party afterwards."" Such is the response to the appeals of party leaders, and it comes up from the patriotic millions all over the North.

Unlike European Governments, our own has never depended upon standing armies for its maintenance or defence -- a vast force to be launched like a thunderholt, upon an instant notice, against a disquieted or insurgent province or community. Upon the breaking out of the great rebellion, we, for the first time, had to create that which at all times has engrossed the chief attention of other Governments, an immense and efficient army, the most difficult of all human contrivances. This Army, too, was to be directed against those who, a few months ago, were in the relation of citizens and friends. Our unwillingness to embark in such bloody work, lead us to try every expedient to avoid it if possible. This feeling, for a long time, had all the appearance of imbecility, and of the want of anything like a definite purpose or policy. When forced to extreme measures, we had to commence what had been entirely neglected for forty years. Our citizens were wrapped up in peaceful pursuits, which they were suddenly called upon to forego, for the sterner duties of war. It was inevitable that, to the experienced Captains of Europe, we should fall into many blunders, and suffer many mortifying disasters, which alone could train a people so situated to final success. In all this we have been judged by results, rather than by the causes that lead to them, or by the inherent strength we really possess. We have been pronounced effete; broken to pieces; with the whole current of our nationality changed, and have been regarded as people, like those of Poland, about to be blotted out from the list of nations, even before, with the utmost diligence, we could adapt ourselves to our unlooked-for dilemma. We were given up for lost before any event had happened that put us in real peril. Such has been the foreign view of our condition, certainly in most striking contrast to our own. We have never shown, because we have never felt, any tropidation or doubt. It was evident that we had great task before us, to the execution of which we set ourselves methodically at work, by raising and putting in condition for vigorous operations a vast army and navy. The disasters suffered have only had the effect to pioneer us on to victory. The favorableness of our condition, in the circumstances, has never been paralleled. Suppose England to be divided into two great hostile camps, the rebels holding nearly one-half its territory and menacing its Capital with a vast army -- what would be the price of consols? Would people crowd to the public offices to compete for Government stocks at the market rate of money for investment? Consols ranged only a little above fifty per cent. for more than twenty years when England was engaged in foreign wars only. The securities of this country are nearly at par with 150,000 or 200,000 rebels in arms in the sight of Washington. At the office of the Assistant Treasurer, in this City, the people took, yesterday, $1,050,000 of the new Government loan. This is outside the action of the Banks. Five hundred such offices are to be immediately opened, at which the whole available capital of the country, if need be, will be proffered to the Government, not out of a sentiment of patriotism, but as a pure business transaction.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Favorable Position of Affairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Favorable Position of Affairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cd5a055c-745c-56d9-97fa-5b6cccc517ca,1039,nyt://article/cd5a055c-745c-56d9-97fa-5b6cccc517ca,

"GOOD NEWS FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. -- We present this morning very favorable news from Western Virginia and Missouri. In Virginia, Gen. ROSECRANS column, about which much apprehension has been felt, has encountered and routed the great thief of the rebels, Gen. FLOYD, capturing his tents, camp equipage, and personal effects of FLOYD and his officers. The route was complete, and not only relieves all fear as to the safety of ROSECKANS, but clears Western Virginia of rebels. The moral effect of this victory will be most excellent, and proves Gen. MCCLELLAN'S declaration that we have suffered our last defeat, was not a vain boast. In Missouri, the Government troops are rapidly dispersing the bands of marauding rebels, and will soon drive them from the State.

"The demand for sewed army shoes for the United States troops, as well as for sewed and pegged shoes for the different States shows no signs of diminution. Last week a gentleman of Indianapolis left two orders for 5,000 pairs of pegged shoes each for the State of Indiana, and several lots, ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of sewed shoes, were disposed of at good prices for New-York, Missouri and other States. Government contracts were also placed in Boston for about 25,000 pairs of cavalry boots at profitable rates. These goods are to be made from 8 1/2 ounce oak upper leather. Some of our manufacturers who received contracts on Saturday were cutting and giving out stock on Monday, ready to turn out the goods at the rate of from one to two hundred pairs daily. In every shoe town in the State workmen are engaged in sewing Army shoes, on which they are getting about 50 cents a pan for bottoming. Good workmen are now having steady employment, and making $1 to $1 50 a day. Six hundred thousand pairs of sewed shoes are being made up in Massachusetts, for which Uncle Sam will pay considerably over a million of dollars. A low average of the amount paid for work, bottoming, fitting, &c., would be 60 cents a pair, equal to $360,000 distributed among the journeymen in the State for making the shoes. This is exclusive of the large amount of both sewed and pegged work for the State, as well as of cavalry boots, which will not fall short of one-half the above amount, or $180,000.

ELLIS, who, as our readers may remember, was convicted over a year and a half ago, of constructive larceny, before Judge BARNARD, and sentenced to the State Prison for three years and a half. The alleged offence was proved by the testimony of a woman known to be of disreputable character, who testified that while on a visit to Dr. ELLIS he asked her to show off a diamond ring which she wore; that she took it off her finger and handed it to him, and that he neverreturned it. This was the whole case against him. Evidence of her character was offered and ruled out. Proof was adduced to show that the woman had once before made complaint and withdrawn it; that she had given the Doctor a receipt for the ring, and that she had acknowledged giving it to him for the purpose of borrowing money upon it: -- but the jury was instructed to disregard all these matters, and to be governed in their verdict by the evidence of woman alone. They did so, and convicted the Doctor, who was on the spot sentenced for the long term mentioned. He has already been in prison a year and a half. Several lawyers, of high position and eminent ability, united in representing to the Governor that the conviction, under the circumstances, was an outrage upon law and justice, and that the punishment already inflicted was greater than the crime would have deserved, even if it had been proved. Upon these representations, and after a careful examination of the records, Gov. MORGAN granted an unconditional release to the Doctor, whose professional and personal standing, previous to this affair, was very good. Various statements are made in regard to the influences which affected the case on its trial, which may possibly be made the subject of inquiry hereafter, and to which therefore, no further allusion need now be made.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/14/archives/pardon-of-dr-ellis.html,,"Governor MORGAN has pardoned Dr. THOMAS T.

"Major BARRY's Battery of Flying Artillery, which arrived by the steamer Cahawba from Fort Pickens, left by railroad at 6 o'clock last evening for Washington. This troop consists of three officers, 86 non-commissioned officers and privates, 60 horses, two 12-pounder howitzers, two 6-pounder guns and four caissons. They left for Fort Pickens in April last, and arrived there at a time of imminent peril. They were compelled to swim their horses half a mile to land, losing eight by drowning and exhaustion. On the 5th inst. they embarked on board the Cahawba, which sailed on the same day. The steamer was detained thirty hours at Key West taking in water. Major BARRY mounted his battery on the spar-deck of the steamer, and kept the guns shotted constantly, as considerable alarm was entertained of an attack from the pirate Sumter, which was thought to be prowling about the Southern waters. The men were armed with sabres and revolvers, and kept a sharp look-out continually. They reached this City, however, without interruption. Major BARRY was compelled to shoot one of his horses, his leg having been broken during the process of landing.

We merely hear of driving in the enemy's pickets and a single regiment, of a ""strong reconnoisance,"" and of the escape of the rebels while our exhausted soldiers were resting on their arms. We also hear with amusement of rifled cannon fired at the retreating fugitives for ""a moral effect.""

To the loyal States it interposed between them and their capital, to lose which would be the surrender of all the records and insignia of their nationality. With foreigners such a defeat would be conclusive of our inability to make headway against the rebellion. Although its loss would only add to the magnitude and cost of the war, it would inflict the deepest disgrace upon our character and our arms. The possession of Maryland is that of Chesapeake Bay, with all its magnificent affluents, which, as lines of defence, or communication, or bases of offensive operation, are unequaled in importance and value in the United States. The North have every motive that can be addressed to a people to retain it, and the rebels equally cogent ones to carry it with the South. So long as a single Slave State maintained its loyalty, secession was only partially accomplished, because the dividing line had no relation to the only thing which marks the difference between the two sections of the country. The North were first in the race, and occupied the soil. The South have been unceasing in their efforts to possess it, which promises speedily to culminate in a great battle. The rebels must have Maryland or disband. Should such a purpose be given up, it would demoralize and dissipate their whole army. The people of the seceding States have always been assured that the capture of Washington was an easy matter; that from Washington they would march triumphantly to Baltimore; from Baltimore to Philadelphia, and onward till the power of the North was completely broken. Washington was to be razed as example of their power, and to satiate their revenge in its destruction. The war was to be wholly waged on Northern soil. Unless these assurances, the certain realization of which has become a religious conviction at the South, be performed, a moral defeat is sustained so complete as to forbid all hopes of success in the field.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Relation of Maryland to the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Relation of Maryland to the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1fdfc831-60f7-5e9c-860c-5987484d03f6,928,nyt://article/1fdfc831-60f7-5e9c-860c-5987484d03f6,

"Arms, ammunition, food and clothing, tents for the soldiers, together with the means of conveying baggage and munitions, are things which cannot be dispensed with in war, and without which, neither numbers, skill, nor bravery, can be rendered available.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/15/archives/the-financial-contrast.html,,"Arms, ammunition, food and clothing, tents for the soldiers, together with the means of conveying baggage and munitions, are things which cannot be dispensed with in war, and without which, neither numbers, skill, nor bravery, can be rendered available. Behind all these, and controlling all, is the necessity for money -- not the doubtful issues of overpressed and non-redeeming banks, nor the still more doubtful issues of a Government whose credit is based upon moonshine, and whose ability, present or remote, to pay, has no visible foundation in any of the ordinary resources of nations, but hard cash or its equivalent in evidences that can at all times he converted into coin. Without this absolute prerequisite, an Army cannot be sustained for any considerable length of time. A single campaign may be fought, lasting so long as the first burst of enthusiasm may continue, or the first supplies remain unexhausted. But the chill blasts of Autumn, the bleak storms of Winter, will cool the ardor of men accustomed to the common necessaries and comforts, if not the luxuries of life, when these shall be wanting. Lack of food, of clothing, of shelter from the storm, unshod feet blistered by marching, or bitten by frost, are stern and practical facts which no enthusiasm can overlook, or false patriotism dispel. They are present and palpable evils hard to be borne, and whose cure can be effected only by the possession and use of money. Military contributions levied at the point of the bayonet, the plunder of a country in which an army may be operating, of its food, its surplus clothing, its means of subsistence and transportation, can at best afford a temporary resource, against which is to be set off the indignation of an incensed and outraged people. Supplies gathered in this way are soon exhausted, and a return to the stern necessity for money must be made. In all modern wars the nation possessing the largest and surest resources in this respect has, with scarcely an exception, been the victor in the strife of arms. Triumph has almost invariably followed the standard supported by the largest and most available supply of cash. Especially has this been so when other circumstances have been anything like equal between the belligerents.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Financial Contrast.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Financial Contrast.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5183f6f5-5ac3-54d8-a328-d5cddea2a14b,904,nyt://article/5183f6f5-5ac3-54d8-a328-d5cddea2a14b,

They are to be received on the footing of the most favored nations; and while a reservation is made that such hospitality is not to be regarded in the light of full recognition, it practically, as the reader will readily see, amounts to such an act. There are no means of judging whether this action of the Captain-General originates at Madrid or at Havana. In the latter case, it may be disavowed by the Spanish Government. In the former, it can only be regarded as an expression of unfriendly feeling toward this Government; and as a bribe offered to Southern fillibusterism that it let Cuba alone. The fact is not one which we can accept as merely an insult and not as an injury. In assuring the rebels that they have only to evade the blockade to find ample supplies of everything they most need awaiting them in friendly ports so convenient as those of Cuba, and that their bastard flag shall protect their privateers from pursuit and capture so long as they remain in Spanish waters, is to offer a huge premium for breaking the blockade, and a bounty upon privateering. All those who now find difficulty in forwarding their wares from the North to the greedy markets of the South, will hereafter ship them to the Antilles, and there dispose of them to customers, who, by using vessels of light draft, which can penetrate any of the keys, bayous, and rivers of the Southern coast, will find little difficulty in reaching supplies. Against this sort of adventure, it will be imposible to make the blockade proof. No vigilance can confine or exclude such inconspicuous craft; and we shall witness a cordon established at so great an expense rendered valueless because of these inevitable evasions. We need not indeed be surprised, if the ports of Cuba, under the new rule, be made depots for cotton which can be gathered up along the coasts by these small bottoms, which will only put to sea when the watching cruiser has left the mouth of the particular estuary. Possibly, this is the sort of smuggling to which the English are looking so confidently, as destined to give them at least one-third of the crop.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spain and Southern Recognition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spain and Southern Recognition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/67af361e-d042-55e5-883f-72da366711e3,725,nyt://article/67af361e-d042-55e5-883f-72da366711e3,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/15/archives/general-city-news-the-spoils-of-magic-exhibited-at-tiffanys.html,,"-- A novel exhibition is now open to the Public at the establishment of TIFFANY Co., the Broadway jewelers. Closely adjoining the well-known centre showcase, which encloses the richest and rarest gems and articles de luxe in the way of ornament, on the continent, is now placed another and larger case, containing the opima spolia of a ten years' campaign in the field of magic. HERMANN, the Prestidigitateur, fills this case, and it might, in legal parlance, be denominated the great case of ""HERMANN vs. a large party of crowned heads, nobles, artists and less nototorious dilettanti."" By the little cards attached to each piece, the Public can see that, if HERMANN be indeed Devil, as the honest Hamburghers once thought him, nevertheless Christian and Jew, Emperors, Kings, Dukes, Duchesses, Marquises, Counts, Marshals, Generals, Dons, Vons, Monsieurs, Scientific Academies, Benevolent Associations, and even -- Editors, have paid him substantial tributes of admiration. Does His Majesty require a time piece? The King who sits on the throne of ""Ferdinand the Catholic"" presents him a superb English lever, with chain and diamond-mounted seal thrown in; the head of the Greek Church puts in his pocket an exquisite little watch and leontine so deftly cased in pearls and amethysts as to make plain gold appear base stuff in the eyes of a CESAR; a Spanish Duke does him homage in the shape of a beautifully enameled Genevese horologe, with chatelaine, dainty enough for a Queen; a Polish Prince, doubtless appreciating the Satanic taste for the mediaeval, makes him the possessor of two Nuremburg eggs; and lastly, some devil of a fellow on our own shores tickles his fancy by the contribution of an honest chronometer in a magic case. The wand with which his majesty evokes ""spirits from the vasty deep,"" is a baton of pure gold, about two feet in length, artistically engraved with arabesques, cunningly inclosing a portrait and other characteristic designs, and tipped at one end by a fine diamond, while the other displays a large sapphire. In strict justice to a very worthy class in society, we feel obliged to state that this elegant presentation was made in January last, by the Press of Havana, the Gaceta, the Prensa de Habana, the Diario de la Marina, and one other journal contributing. Of course His Majesty must have a hunting-knife; and recognizing this necessity, in 1859, His other Majesty, Don PEDRO, King of Portugal, sent him from the Royal Armory a couteau de chasse, the choice antique that his ancestors might not so readily have parted with -- a fine Toledo blade, the hilt a rare piece of jasper, some three inches in length, profusely garnished with diamonds of the finest water, and the sheath beautifully mounted in gold and brilliants, with the ruby-eyed dragons of the national quarterings forming the guard. For full dress, the contributions are particularly rich, and by no means few. In 1859 certain admirers in Oporto, the little city as famous for its production of exquisite work in silver filigree as for its wine, made him a present of a gold crown of rare beauty. The same year the Duchess of Palmela, at Lisbon, craves his acceptance of a gold card-case, in one side of which, by the springing up of an enameled medalion, a tiny watch is discovered. The year before the Emperor of Brazil furnished for his neck adornment a unique scarf pin, headed with two pearls of magnificent proportions and oriency. For a change he has three other scarf-pins, of brilliants, presented by European admirers. A very pretty enameled eyeglass, containing a watch, is the tribute of another Duchess. A pair of choice rubies set in small diamonds for shirt studs, were the gift of the Archduke of Oldenburg, in 1851, to which, not thinking his majesty in this respect suitably furnished, the Archduchess of Hohenzollern added a pair of splendid sapphires, similarly mounted, in 1860. His choicest sleeve-buttons were presented by the Archduke JOSEPH, of Austria, being amethysts, each containing a large diamond in the centre, the gold nowhere apparent. A complete set of diamond buttons, twelve in number, for the wrist, bosom and vest, are the gift of the Austrian Emperor. Another parure of thirteen diamonds shows the appreciation of a Spanish Calderon, and there is still another of pearls and rubies from a second grandee of Madrid. For his lady, the Queen ISABELLA, who had already given him a very beautiful commander's cross of Her Order, furnished a superb bracelet of brilliants -- the King of Spain a pair of diamond hair-pins, -- the Emperor JOSEPH, of Austria, in 1851, a unique brooch, in the shape of a butterfly; the Archduke CHARLES a large diamond solitaire ring, and Marshal RADETSKY a gold and coral bracelet at Verona, the same year; in 1852, at St. Petersburgh, the Emperor NICHOLAS a very curious brooch, formed of a large pearl, with emeralds and diamonds, wrought into the semblance of a dragon; in 1855, at Copenhagen, King FREDERICK, of Denmark, a fine pair of solitaire diamond ear-rings; and in 1851, at Munich, LOLA MONTEZ's old dotard, LUDWIG, another pair of ear-rings of fine pearls, with brilliants.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GENERAL CITY NEWS.; THE SPOILS OF MAGIC EXHIBITED AT TIFFANY'S."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""GENERAL CITY NEWS.; THE SPOILS OF MAGIC EXHIBITED AT TIFFANY'S."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87c1dd4e-cd8f-550f-9909-fb4c2070dae9,2710,nyt://article/87c1dd4e-cd8f-550f-9909-fb4c2070dae9,

"IN THE DELAWARE. -- Yesterday morning, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the steam ferry-boat Curlew left South-street wharf for Gloucester, having on board 143 head of cattle, a wagon and two horses, and one passenger. When the boat was a short distance below the Navy-yard the cattle became frightened from some cause, and crowded to the bow of the boat. The great weight depressed the bow, until the water rushed into the dead lights, just under the guards of the boat, with such volume, that the boat sunk in a few moments to within a few feet of the upper deck. The cattle then swam about in the river, and the boat floated down with the tide until below Kaighn's Point. The Kaighn's Point ferry-boat went to the assistance of the Curlew and took the passenger and Captain off, and boats from the Harriet Lane and other vessels rowed to the scene, and by surrounding the cattle, drove them to the Jersey shore, by which means all but five were saved. The cattle belonged to Messrs. GEORGE BECKETT and WM. TOURLIN. The horses were also safely landed. The ferry-boat, lightened of her load, continued to float down until a tug-boat fastened a line to her, and towed her to the Jersey shore, a short distance below Kaighn's Point. Capt. STEWART, the owner of the boat, intends getting her upon the shore at the next high tide, and then procure the services of a steam fire engine to pump her out. The surface of the river for some distance was covered with the struggling cattle, and for some time they continued to swim about the boat, and made attempts to clamber upon the upper deck, and, but for the assistance rendered by the small boats, the cattle would have been scattered along the shores on each side of the river; as it was, one steer crossed the Delaware, and landed below the Navy-yard. The accident will not delay the business of the line, as one of the old boats which remained at Gloucester was started in the place of the sunken one.

Earlier in the day at a matinee for instance a little refulgency of speech might not be out of place, for there the tongue is nimble and the memory quick to catch a new word. But when a man has worked for his daily bread with the sweat of his brow, and partaken of an honest, perhaps generous evening's repast, it is, we think, requiring too much of him, that he should be expected to walk up stairs and ask the ladies with polite coherency, to go with him to see the Prestidigilateur. The word wizard is a much more charitable cognomen. It has a thick and luscious sound. There is is a kind of beeswing in it. But prestidigitateur is a barricade, and we are not surprised to hear that horses -- who live on a purely temperate diet, you know -- have shied at it. Great conjurers always use big words. In the olden times their garments were bescrawled with hieroglyphics; now they twist and turn the type into something oracular, or at all events horrifying. How acute must be the emotions of Adolphus, who palpipates at monosyllables, and in point of fact, expects to be finished off one these days with the smallest of the lot; how acute must be his emotions where he is impelled by a harsh destiny to ask the severely critical and slightly captious Agelina if she will prestidigitate.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.; First Performance of Mr. Hermann at the Academy of Music.

The man had been talking disrespectfully of the Administration, while in a drinking saloon on Broadway, opposite the Park, and his sentiments not meeting with approbation, it was determined to take him before the Mayor. On the way thither, a crowd of several hundred persons followed him, crying, ""Hang him!"" ""Shoot him!"" and making use of other expressions calculated to make him afraid. Marshal BURNHAM directed that the prisoner should be taken to Police Head-quarters, and there he was examined by Inspector CARPENTER. He said that he was a Union man, who could not coincide with Mr. LINCOLN in his war policy, but probably had given too loose a rein to his sentiments, therefore the outcry had been made against him. Mr. CARPENTER told him that in future it behooved him to be more careful, and with this word of caution he was allowed to go.

"The policy of the rebels from the first, has been to render the Border States the seat of the war.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/17/archives/a-movement-on-the-rebel-flank.html,,"The policy of the rebels from the first, has been to render the Border States the seat of the war. They alone of those in rebellion are fruitful in the means for supporting an Army; they are relatively stronger in men, and have less to fear from servile insurrections. In them the negro performed only a portion of the labor in the field. Could the tide of war be stayed in them, the Cotton States would escape with very little harm. As cotton is their sole staff, to interfere with its cultivation would imperil their existence. From the Border States it was believed a blow might be struck in the capture of Washington; or still better, in that of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and perhaps of New-York, which would so humble the North that it would, it was believed, enable the rebels to dictate peace. Nothing could exceed the confidence, both in their prowess and in the ease with which the North could be subdued. As it was of the utmost importance that a decided blow should be early dealt, every man the Cotton States could raise was instantly pushed North to swell the Grand Army of the Potomac. All their energies have been concentrated here, leaving, with a fatuity which we shall ere long discover is characteristic of all their operations, every vulnerable point on their coast, either without any, or at least with defences entirely inadequate to resist any considerable attack. We shall find when we get along a little further in this war, that the Southern people are really incapable of works which require forethought, patient industry, a definite purpose, and an abundant supply of money. Any person who has visited them will understand what we mean. Nothing can exceed the shiftlessness, indolence and indifference to any useful work of the great portion of their white population. The same qualities will be seen in whatever they undertake. Their people show best in the field, where dash and impetuosity go far, in the outset, to make up for those solid qualities which reach their highest efficiency only through long training. The history of the Fort Hatteras affair will serve as an illustration and example of what we may expect to find in all the fortifications on the Southern coast. Here was a work, in the hands of the rebels, capable of defending a State, and to a very great extent of protecting its industries and people, but which, in the hands of the enemy, was capable of destroying both, so wretchedly built and garrisoned that it surrendered after a day's bombardment by a few vessels of war, and was captured without the loss of a man by the assailants. These vessels, with a regiment on board, accomplished results that could hardly be expected from an Army in the field of 50,000 men. The letters and documents captured showed that some of the more intelligent officers appreciated the importance of the position, and urged that it should at once be made correspondingly strong. It was not done; not that North Carolina had not a plenty of men, and could easily have raised money enough for the construction of a first-class fortification, but her people could never be made to appreciate the importance of the step till too late, and it consequently fell an easy prey. As we go South we shall find that nearly every fortification we attack is a Hatteras, some of them stronger, perhaps, than that which was to guard North Carolina, but none of them strong enough to resist a well-concerted attack. The rebels in most of the States have neither men nor money for such works. What they possess they have stolen from the United States, after they had been built of Northern material by Northern mechanics. Their attention has been turned elsewhere, so that if we move with promptitude, we can in our attacks have matters pretty much our own way.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Movement on the Rebel Flank.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Movement on the Rebel Flank.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a920f537-9e66-53c2-a1d0-8efdfe0b696f,1250,nyt://article/a920f537-9e66-53c2-a1d0-8efdfe0b696f,

"The Northern states have suffered from the present war as men always do when a malicious or unruly neighbor threatens to burn their buildings, steal their property or take their lives. It may become necessary in such case to maintain a large police force, at great expense.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/18/archives/northern-commerce-independent-of-the-war.html,,"The Northern states have suffered from the present war as men always do when a malicious or unruly neighbor threatens to burn their buildings, steal their property or take their lives. It may become necessary in such case to maintain a large police force, at great expense. This the Northern States are doing, but thus far they know of the effects of civil war only by report. It does not rage in their borders. The mischief-maker is either incarcerated, or is within the limits we have prescribed to him. The articulations of Northern society and Northern industry are as free and undisturbed as ever. Twenty millions of people seek their nightly repose with the same sense of security as if the war was raging in China. To them it is, in all its attributes, a war on foreign soil, and entirely hemmed in from the sea. Both our domestic and foreign commerce have had a season of unwonted activity. The traffic and earnings of our railroads and canals, that bear the most intimate relations to the great routes of our internal commerce, are largely in excess of those of the past year. The contrast is so well stated in the weekly circular of an enterprising house in this City, a portion of which will be found in our commercial columns, that we make free to introduce some of the statements and conclusions it furnishes. From it it appears that the earnings for the present year of sixteen railroad companies, the same that are accustomed to report them monthly, with the earnings of the Erie Canal, have been $29,643,707, against $26,242,568 for 1860, showing an absolute gain of $3,301,139, or a rate equal to 13 per cent., for the year of rebellion over one of peace and remarkable prosperity, The activity at the great centres of trade correspond with that on our public works. The deliveries of grain at Chicago, the present year, have been 38,214,294 bushels, against 22,866,088 bushels for a corresponding period for 1860, and 9,735,582 bushels for 1859. The deliveries at tide-water, through the Erie Canal for 1861, have been 31,304,049 bushels, against 22,632,835 bushels for a similar period for 1860, and 5,234,388 bushels for 1859. The exports of Breadstuffs to England and the Continent have been equivalent to 54,682,639 bushels for 1861, against 11,191,799 bushels for 1860, and 1,644,662 bushels for 1859. The condition of the foreign trade of the country is anomalous beyond example. The imports, exclusive of specie, at the port of New-York alone, since the 1st of July, 1861, compared with those for a similar period for 1860, have fallen off $78,445,007; the imports for last year being $175,292,275; for the present, $96,847,208. The exports, exclusive of specie, in the same time, have gone from $63,843,917, in 1860, to 91,246,351 the present year. The receipts of gold from Europe and California, since Jan. 1, have been $66,739,000, while the exports have been only $3,260,000, leaving a balance in our favor, for the first eight months of the year, of $63,478,000. This is a most remarkable exhibition for a nation that foreigners are assuring themselves, and trying to convince us, is effete, on the verge of annihilation, whose only salvation is a reconstruction upon the models of the despotism of the Old World, and the London Times or Economist favor us with their views of this remarkable exhibit.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Northern Commerce Independent of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Northern Commerce Independent of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/02c95878-9188-597a-ae81-645a3a986a7f,781,nyt://article/02c95878-9188-597a-ae81-645a3a986a7f,

"The hall in Sleecker Buildings was filled last evening in obedience to a call for a meeting of the citizens of all parties, to ratify the nominations made by the Union Conventions at Syracuse. Ex-Alderman BRISLEY called the meeting to order, and nominated EDWARD J. HAMILTON for President, who was unanimously elected. Mr. HAMILTON highly eulogized Hon. DANIEL S. DICKINSON, and announced his purpose to sustain the nominations made at Syracuse. The time had come when all men who loved their country must lay aside all party feeling and go heart and soul for the Union. A list of gentlemen, prominent as leaders in both the Democratic, Republican and American parties were elected Vice-Presidents, who took seats on the platform. The Union Glee Club opened the meeting with patriotic songs, after which a letter was read from J. SHERMAN BROWNELL, fully indorsing the objects of the meeting, and adopting the language of Commodore DECATUR, ""My country, right, but right or wrong, my country."" Hon. CHAUNCEY SHAFFER then came forward and spoke at considerable length upon the present condition of the country and the conduct of the war.

The time had come when all men who loved their country must lay aside all party feeling and go heart and soul for the Union. A list of gentlemen, prominent as leaders in both the Democratic, Republican and American parties were elected Vice-Presidents, who took seats on the platform. The Union Glee Club opened the meeting with patriotic songs, after which a letter was read from J. SHERMAN BROWNELL, fully indorsing the objects of the meeting, and adopting the language of Commodore DECATUR, ""My country, right, but right or wrong, my country."" Hon.

In the meantime, there cannot be too great activity on the part of the Federal Government. Military men have long seen the necessity of securing and holding the very positions assumed by ZOLLIKOFFER, if we would make our occupation of Western Virginia safe and permanent. The difficulty has been that to reach those points the absurd neutrality of Kentucky would have to be violated -- a scruple of so much weight with the President, that he preferred to run the risk of a hostile seizure rather than march an army from Ohio to the Gap. This scruple no longer exists. The enemy is at the rear of our gallant bands in Virginia; and they can only be protected by an energy proportioned to our previous supineness.

The relator was charged and tried before the said Police Justice with a violation of a Corporation ordinance, and being convicted, was sentenced to pay a fine of $10 or imprisonment for ten days. The offence charged upon Falconer was collecting and promoting assemblages of persons, under pretence of exhortation, in the streets of the City.

The arrangements had been made for her funeral to take place on Monday morning, but just prior to the removal of the remains, some members of the Police took charge of them, by order of Coroner SCHIRMER, who had received information of the facts in the case. Dr. GEORGE B. BOUTON afterwards made a post-mortem examination of the body, and found undoubted evidence that death had resulted from the cause stated. A Jury was thereupon summoned, and last evening the Coroner commenced an investigation, for the purpose of discovering the perpetrator or instigator of the crime. Much evidence was taken, but it was of a hearsay character, and therefore not entitled to implicit credence. Deceased came to this country from Scotland two years ago, and went to live in the family of her uncle, Mr. HUGH MCALPINE, a blacksmith, bearing a good reputation, who has lived many years in the Ninth Ward. Six months since she obtained work as a seamstress in Leake & Watts Orphan Asylum, and her character for virtue does not seem to have been questioned. On Friday week she was taken ill, and after being sick some days she made confessions to one of her associates, charging her uncle with having abused her and caused her ruin. At her own request, on Tuesday, the 10th inst., she was brought down to her uncle's house, No. 643 Hudson-street, where Dr. NORVAL, late of the Seventy-ninth Regiment, attended and prescribed for her, and after her death made out a certificate attributing it indirectly to disease of the heart, and directly to inflammation of the bowels, or peretonetus. The doctor could not be found yesterday, having gone to the country for a day. Dr. NORVAL returned last night, and, consequently, his testimony was not obtained. Under these circumstances, Coroner SCHIRMER adjourned the investigation, and meanwhile a search will be made for witnesses, who will probably be able to give information of importance in the case.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/18/archives/general-city-news.html,,"SHAMEFUL DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN -- MYSTERIOUS CASE. -- MARY DUNLOP, a seamstress, aged 26 years, died on Sunday morning last, at No. 643 Hudson-street, from the consequences of having an abortion procured.

"At the present time the position of Canada, as regards prosperity, contentment and loyalty, is such that the appointment of a Governor-General would be a matter comparatively of trifling importance if the interests of the Province were alone concerned.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/19/archives/the-new-governor-of-canada-from-the-london-post.html,,"At the present time the position of Canada, as regards prosperity, contentment and loyalty, is such that the appointment of a Governor-General would be a matter comparatively of trifling importance if the interests of the Province were alone concerned. But, unfortunately, the state of affairs in the neighboring Republic requires that the authority of the Imperial Government should be exercised with a strong and vigorous hand, and that questions of international policy should not be left to the decision of any local legislature or provincial administration. The office of Governor-General of Canada is, in fact, a Viceroyship. The Governor-General is supposed, in virtue of his commission, to control the administration of all the subordinate Governors of the North American Provinces. He has to govern more than three millions of subjects, and he has not only to attend to their domestic welfare, but also to assert the rights and dignity of the mother country. The nobleman who has been selected to succeed Sir EDMUND HEAD has had large experience of public and official life. He has been a useful and industrious member of the House of Commons, he has held the office of a Lord of the Treasury, and he has had the benefit of the professional training of the lawyer. Viscount MONCK, however, must remember that he is about to assume an office which will require higher qualifications than those of balancing the claims of the political parties which in Canada, as elsewhere, are bidding for power. No one in this country much cares whether the ""Clear Grits"" are in office, or whether Mr. BROWN or Mr. CARTIER head the Provincial Administration. The most important duties which Viscount MONCK will have to perform will be to maintain the neutrality of the province, to develop its resources, and promote its material prosperity, and to show to the world that the monarchical institutions of Canada confer more real freedom, and have in them elements of permanency far greater than those of the neighboring Republic. It would seem that while the people of the once United States are finally separating, British North America is only anxious for that federal union which would give national power and organization to every province on the continent which owns the sway of her Majesty. We do not anticipate that Viscount MONCK will have a very difficult task. Even if by some accident peace should be restored in the United States, and the half a million men in arms should be let loose upon Canada, the province is quite ready, and has full strength enough to hold its own. Viscount MONCK, however, may accomplish great good by elevating the tone of public men in Canada. At present it is believed that the members of the Provincial Government (composed chiefly of lawyers) are not altogether innocent of complicity in those jobs which have made the Grand Trunk Railway a scandal and disgrace to the Province. In the present circumstances of the United States he will not only have to maintain the dignity and neutrality of Canada, but he may foster manufactures and commerce, and, above all, attract to the Province that vast stream of emigration which hitherto has so unaccountably proceeded to the States of the American Union. He will govern, at all events, a loyal, contented and peaceable people, who enjoy and appreciate as large an amount of political freedom and material prosperity as ever has fallen to the lot of man in the world.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF CANADA.; From the London Post', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF CANADA.; From the London Post', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5323d789-ba70-5868-ab27-40bf5b3c5535,577,nyt://article/5323d789-ba70-5868-ab27-40bf5b3c5535,

We have had universal suffrage among the soldiers. Colonels, majors, and we hardly know what other officers have attained their posts of honor and danger by the ballot. The process has been simple. A martial clerk from some village shop, who has figured on ""training days"" on the green, or a broken-down city adventurer who has served in a target company, gathers together some ardent and unemployed young men for the purpose of serving their country. He borrows or begs money enough to keep his band together a few days, until he can obtain permission from the authorities to raise a regiment. When this is secured, he gathers the men in assembly, and the precious privilege of American citizens is conferred upon them, and they proceed to elect their own officers. Of course the mover of the whole enterprise, though he may know no more of strategy than of astrology, is at once elected Colonel, unanimously, and his particular friend -- though he may be equally qualified -- is chosen Lieutenant-Colonel, and another Major, for similar reasons, until the regiment is officered. Or, taking a more favorable, but more unusual instance, a man of some military experience is chosen Colonel, and the subordinate officers are elected by the men, because they are ""popular,"" or good fellows, or because they have some especial social position in their towns or wards. The position to which the democratic theory is thus applied has no precise analogy in the offices of civil life. A military officer is towards his men more as a ship captain is towards his passengers, or a pilot to the crew. Universal suffrage is about as applicable to the one case as the other. The Colonel of a regiment has the lives and honor of his men in his hands, he can lead them into useless and dangerous positions, from which they can never extricate themselves, or by some act of base cowardice he can demoralize his corps. He is at once leader and pilot. So, in less degree, with the subordinate officers. Even the Quartermasters, Commissaries and Captains have the health and comfort of the men entirely in their power. If they are dishonest or incompetent the soldiers will find their strength gone before the battle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Universal Suffrage in the Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Universal Suffrage in the Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad108ab6-2fff-5b95-b24a-80f133dca357,956,nyt://article/ad108ab6-2fff-5b95-b24a-80f133dca357,

The regiment is composed mainly of sons of farmers from the adjacent counties, all educated and thinking men, who, when the completion of the harvest left them a choice of occupation or idleness, chose to enlist in their country's cause, and cheerfully give their aid to crush the great rebellion. The orders for marching were received on Saturday night at 9 o'clock, and at 6 o'clock on Monday morning the regiment was in the cars of the Erie Railroad, en route for the seat of war. Just as the cars were about starting, an entire company, which had been recruited at Jamestown, Chatauque County, came up, and joining the regiment, came on with it, forming the eleventh Company, L. With the exception of this company and a few recruits who joined a day or two before the camp was broken up, all the men are clothed in uniform similarto that worn by the regulars of the Army. They have no arms, knapsacks, nor indeed any of they equipments, but Gov. MORGAN assured the commanding officer that these should be promptly provided in this City. They brought no horses, wagons, tents, or any other necessary for field operations, all of which will, however, be provided here. The regiment is at present quartered at the Park Barracks, where they will probably remain until Saturday. They are accompanied by Hon. F.A. ALDBERGER, Mayor of Buffalo, Aldermen ADAMS, HOWARD, STORK, and ISAAC HOLLOWAY, a wealthy gentleman of Buffalo, who has been very liberal in his assistance to effect the organization of the regiment, and who will remain to see that the men lack nothing before they leave for the seat of war. Yesterday afternoon one of the men managed to pass the sentries, and was making rapid tracks through the Park, either intending to desert or perhaps from a desire to see more of New-York than he could from the barracks, but he was overtaken by a couple of officers who escorted him back to quarters, where he was introduced to the guard-house.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARRIVAL OF THE SECOND BUFFALO REGIMENT.; LIST OF OFFICERS--THE MAYOR OF BUFFALO WITH THEM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARRIVAL OF THE SECOND BUFFALO REGIMENT.; LIST OF OFFICERS--THE MAYOR OF BUFFALO WITH THEM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3a5b33c-108e-501f-9c5e-5c4e37f8a686,643,nyt://article/c3a5b33c-108e-501f-9c5e-5c4e37f8a686,

He was last seen alive about 10 o'clock that night on his post near Ninety-second-street and Eighth-avenue, and no direct evidence as to the manner of his death was obtained, but the circumstances leave no room to doubt how it occurred. In order to connect the Aqueduct with the new Reservoir, the brick arch forming the top of the Aqueduct had been removed, and CROWLEY, probably in leaning over the stream to dip a drink of water, fell into it head foremost, striking his head against the wall with sufficient force to stun him. The grade of the Aqueduct at this point is only three-sixteenths of an inch to the hundred feet, but the velocity with which the water passes into the Reservoir is very great in consequence of the narrowness of the conduit, (only four feet,) and there being nothing to which the unfortunate man could cling, he was swept by the current through the flood-gate into, the Reservoir. On Tuesday morning, when the laborers went to work, they found the body floating. CROWLEY resided at the corner of Second-avenue and One hundred and Twenty-second-street, and has left a large family. He had been in the employ of the Croton Department many years, and was a sober, steady man.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7f77988-7652-57a8-945f-616032e4bdde,1305,nyt://article/c7f77988-7652-57a8-945f-616032e4bdde,

The United States of North America have ceased to be. Whether their place will be taken by two Unions or twenty -- whether the principle of confederation will be merely limited or absolutely discarded -- nobody can venture to foretell; but we cannot so much as imagine any course of events which will leave the last state of things with much resemblance to the first. Enough has now been learnt to show that the subjugation of the South is next to impossible, and its submission in the highest degree improbable. The Territories of the old Union will be divided, nor will the partition be territorial only. Between North and South there will be barriers of feelings, interests and traditions. They will long look upon each other with jealousy and suspicion, if not with still worse sentiments, and the ""frontier"" will require the same garrisons and observances as that between two monarchies of the European Continent. This, however, presumes the maintenance of standing armies, warlike estimates and oppressive taxation; while these burdens again will exercise an influence upon all social and political institutions.

In 1849 he was attacked with paralysis, by which, in the words of the Surrogate, ""he was not permanently deprived of testamentary capacity."" Immediately after this attack he made a codicil by which he gave his wife property bearing about the same proportion to the value of his estate at this time as that which he had previously given her by his will in 1842.

It was a lengthy document, and advanced the opinion, supported by copious extracts of law, that the Supervisors have no right to reduce the tax levy, unless by reducing the regular county appropriations; that they have no right to inquire or determine whether the City appropriations are necessary or judicious, but they must raise the amount specified by the Legislature; and that it was injudicious to ask the heads of Departments whether reductions could be made, because whether the whole of an appropriation should be expended or not, depended alone upon the Common Council, who directed the Departments. The report concluded by recommending the adoption of the ordinance previously submitted by the Comptroller, levying the tax as stated in the enacting clause of the act passed by the Legislature.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.; THE TAX LEVY NOT CONFIRMED YET A MINORITY REPORT FROM MR.

Nearly two-thirds (or 13,000) of this fallingoff is in the Irish element alone -- the Germans [???] behind their number of last year only some 3,000 souls. Up to the month of May the Irish emigration was considerably greater than it was to the same time last year, and bade fair then speedily to attain to something like the volume it reached in the Celtic flood-tide of 1857, and it is since that month that the great decrease, as compared with last year's arrivals, has taken place. At present the stream of humanity hitherward from Ireland is almost completely dried up. This may be due, in a partial degree, directly to the political perturbations; but it is undoubtedly owing much more to the scanty demand for labor, and to the doleful accounts doubtless sent home by the thousands of Irish laborers, railroaders, servant maids, &c., who have been thrown out of employment by the stagnation of business, the stoppage of public enterprises, and the collapse of incomes. In regard to the heavy arrival of German immigrants at this port, it must be borne in mind that there has been diverted hitherward by the blockade the whole of the large continental immigration which formerly entered the Mississippi Valley by way of New-Orleans and other Southern ports -- so that the probabilities are, that, taking the whole country, there has been quite as great a falling off in the Teutonic as in the Celtic migratory element.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Falling Off in Immigration.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Falling Off in Immigration.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Immigration and Emigration', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d3018b4-421c-5e29-8aaf-6a91404d21a5,815,nyt://article/3d3018b4-421c-5e29-8aaf-6a91404d21a5,

The sporting fraternity they who, arrayed in fine apparel, stand musingly upon Broadway corners; whose hirsute appendages are of the longest and sleekest, and whose manners are more than Chesterfieldian does not often allow itself to exhibit the vulgar excitement which marked it yesterday. The occasion of this disturbed equanimity, however, was excusable. Two of its members had fought a duel by the early morning light, and offended honor had been appeased. The weapons, broadswords, and the place, romantic and secluded -- McComb's Dam, on the banks of the Harlem River. In the street your real gambler is ever taciturn upon professional topics, except to his colaborers, and where so important a thing as ""a meeting"" is concerned, involving unpleasant consequences to the participants, it is to be expected that he will be almost mute. Therefore, reticence was the rule yesterday, but from ""another source"" we obtained the story of the affair. The names of the principals are BOB WILLIS and SAMUEL HYMAN. WILLIS keeps a salon at No. 540 Broadway; HYMAN, who is recently from New-Orleans, acts as a decoy. A few evenings since a dispute arose between them respecting the way in which a ""green one"" had been ""plucked."" HYMAN demanded of WILLIS that a large portion of the money should be restored, but WILLIS was not willing to make restitution to the extent which had been named. A challenge was the result, but from which our informant could not say. It was accepted, and the preliminaries having been arranged according to the code, the meeting occurred yesterday morning in presence of at least two dozen friends of the principals. The weapons were broad-swords or sabres, and both men are said to have fought bravely. Neither was over skillful, but WILLIS' impetuosity won him the victory. The contest was very brief -- HYMAN having received two wounds, one on the forearm and the other on the knee, which were sufficiently severe to disable him. He was immediately brought to his residence in a carriage, while the others returned to the City by different routes as quietly as possible. WILLIS escaped even a scratch. We have not heard that any attempt will be made to arrest him.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c773419-4d9f-559e-a002-642d3d39ddc1,1257,nyt://article/4c773419-4d9f-559e-a002-642d3d39ddc1,

"The extraordinary exhibit presented by the records of the commerce of the Port of New-York for the first eight months of the year, is but the legitimate evidence of the financial or material condition of the country. In this period we have been subjected to the severest test a nation can undergo, with a most triumphant result, without the least warning or preparation. With the trade of nearly one-half of our country a blank, we found ourselves, when the day of reckoning came, the creditor nation of the world. Our completecommercial independence is owing to the fact that the world must have what we produce in agriculture, while we can easily dispense with whatever other countries produce, either in agriculture or in the arts. None of the nations of Eastern Europe regularly raise a sufficient supply of food -- Great Britain never. The United States is their granary, for the reason that, from the cheapness of production, they can undersell all other nations. We have the advantage of cheap soil, which has been accumulating fertility since the creation, and avenues for moving its crops to market vastly superior to that of any other nation. The natural fertility of our soil is an estate really exceeding in value the wealth possessed by any other country in the world. In some portions of the country, the same crop has been produced on the same soil a half century in succession, with hardly a perceptible diminution in the yield. The vast prairies of Illinois are planted year after year, without the least evidence of an exhausted strength. They are a placer infinitely richer than the mines of California. Their products count by hundreds of millions of bushels. The cost of producing Indian Corn on them will hardly exceed ten cents the bushel; that of Wheat not more than fifty. Illinois is only a good specimen of the West, and does not excel many other States in wheat. They are all so fertile that in breadstuffs and provisions they are the favored spot of the world, and can always drive a competitor out of the markets of Western Europe, by underselling him at a profit. The production of food is the specialty of our people, just as the production of iron is that of England, wines and silks of France, and sugar of the fervid regions of the tropics. We might as well attempt to rival other nations, whose superiority depends upon natural gifts not possessed by ourselves, as for them to take from us the superiority in cheapness of food.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/20/archives/our-commercial-independence.html,,"The extraordinary exhibit presented by the records of the commerce of the Port of New-York for the first eight months of the year, is but the legitimate evidence of the financial or material condition of the country.

The prosecution of the Slave-trade out of our Northern ports has received another severe blow in the condemnation and forfeiture of the bark Augusta for being engaged in that traffic.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/21/archives/bad-prospects-for-the-slavetrade.html,,"The prosecution of the Slave-trade out of our Northern ports has received another severe blow in the condemnation and forfeiture of the bark Augusta for being engaged in that traffic. Judge SHIPMAN's opinion in the case is found in full in our columns this morning. The bark, it appears, was being fitted out at Greenport, L.I., when she was seized. One APPLEY claimed to own her, and APPLETON OAKSMITH, of this City, formerly connected with some alleged fillibustering enterprises out of this port, and more lately a publisher and printer here, appeared to have acted as his agent in the matter. These parties, alleged, that so far from intending to make a voyage for ""black birds,"" they were only going after black-fish; that the voyage was a whaling-voyage; that the vessel was an old whaler, and her outfit only such as was appropriate to a perfectly honest character. There seemed, to the Judge, however, to be some circumstances of suspicion about her, which led him to believe that she was not intended for a whaler. The whole trade is in a very depressed state, requiring great care, skill and economy to make it a very profitable one, while these parties had no experience in the matter. The parties stated that they had proposed to send the Augusta on a short cruise of fifteen months, while it appeared that such voyages were almost entirely given up in the trade, and that the Augusta was altogether too large for such a voyage, for, from her size, she required too many hands to navigate her, which would make the voyage too expensive to be by any possibility profitable. Then, also, there had been no steps taken to engage competent officers for a whaling voyage, although the time of her departure was near at hand. Moreover, her provisions were suspicious. She was greatly deficient in the supply of many articles absolutely necessary for a whaling voyage; and there was a superabundance of many articles especially adapted for a slave voyage. The greater part of the beef on board was more or less tainted, though enough of it was sweet to supply a crew for a short voyage, such as a slave voyage would be. The claimants explained this singular fact about the beef, by saying that they had bought a lot cheap, which required repacking, and meant to have had it repacked after the vessel went to sea, and as she had been detained it had spoiled; but they did not prove where they bought this lot, nor why they did not save it by repacking it after the vessel was seized, if that was all that was necessary to save it. Furthermore, the bark had on board an uncommon number of casks of water, and though some of them had oil in them, yet it was shown that this would not prevent the use of the water, though it would make it unpalatable.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bad Prospects for the Slave-trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bad Prospects for the Slave-trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/083c24bc-3759-5991-a74c-ae94b1370c2e,807,nyt://article/083c24bc-3759-5991-a74c-ae94b1370c2e,

He had made an engagement to go out as Captain of the bark Augusta, recently condemned as a Slave-trading craft.

The entrance to the platform, at the side door on Fourth-avenue, was the scene of no little chagrin. A strong force of policemen guarded the passage, and, with vigorous muscle and ready baton, sought to exclude all unauthorized distinguished guests. They found this no easy task, as several sets of tickets of admission had been issued, and several cliques of committeemen insisted each on its peculiar ticket as the genuine simon pure. The red ticket men were particularly severe on the white ticket-holders. It was the old war of the Roses renewed -- York against Lancaster. The last of the tricolors was supplied by the feelings of the ejected, for while the tickets were red and white, they were decidedly blue. Certainly such an incongruous assemblage never before crowded the platform. It was asserted that the white tickets were freely distributed on the corners of the adjacent streets, and the places of the legitimate red ticket invited guests were filled by the canaille.

The Richmond Whig states that soldiers have been taken out of the ranks to work in making army clothing, and Richmond merchants urge that every soldier who is a shoemaker should be at once discharged and set to making canvas shoes. In the cold and wet of the approaching Fall and Winter, the lack of these articles will be much more injurious to the rebels than it has been thus far, but we may be very sure that nothing but the keenest sense of necessity would induce them to supply that lack by taking men out of the ranks. To be sure, if all the shoemakers and tailors were taken out of their Army, it would not be so much felt as if that Army had been recruited from Lynn or from Williamsburgh, but with the dread of seacoast attacks urging them to attack MCCLELLAN -- an undertaking which will call for the utmost expenditure of means and the largest gathering of their forces -- we may be sure that they would not allow of the departure of a sisgle man from their ranks to make coats and shoes, but for the knowledge that this was the only way to prevent a much more severe diminution of their forces by disease.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Supplies of the Rebel Army', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Supplies of the Rebel Army', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'APPAREL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4676096-ea22-55b5-8e40-2747cd22ae46,893,nyt://article/e4676096-ea22-55b5-8e40-2747cd22ae46,

Being entirely relieved of all anxiety about raising money, his whole attention-can now be given to its economical expenditure. The negotiation was a crowning success in more ways than one. It completely established confidence in the Government; rendered it respectable at home and abroad; gave full assurance of the defeat of the rebellion, and was the first important step toward a renewed commercial activity. With a strong Government, all the interests of society take care of themselves. Individuals can embark in full confidence upon their customary enterprises. All our flagging industries, consequently, have been again set in motion. Fortunately, that devoted to agriculture has been amply rewarded by abundant crops, and by an active foreign, as well as domestic, demand.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/23/archives/new-publications.html,,"Some years since, the Old World was sighing for a new sensation it wanted a poet. The Laureate seemed to be slumbering on his laurels. Beyond annually congratulating the Queen, the nation, and the world upon the last ""happy event,"" he added very little to the sum of human poesy. And the world was anxiously looking around for some one else to crown. The world seldom looks for anything in vain, and soon the cry went up: We have found him. The name of the stronger was SMITH. Despite its lack of sonorousness, the name speedily became a famous one, and was echoed in the trump of fame. Such a welcome was given its bearer as young bard never before received. The reviews all said: This is he for whom we have long waited. Young ladies said: Tell us not that the Age of Poesy is past; and everyone was jubilant. The numerous and respectable family of Smiths lifted up their heads, and ceased to torture their patronymical appellation with interpolated and added letters; door-plates bearing that name were burnished, and your old friend JOHN no longer blushed when he gave you his card. But very soon there came a change. The world read the pages of the poet carefully, and came to the conclusion that it had been befooled. ""This young singer,"" it said, ""has made us drunk with adjectives and epithets; he has bewildered us with words; he led us captive with the melody of his voice, but his utterances are idle as the wind. We revoke our verdict. He is not the Poet for whom we have so long looked and waited!"" Careful critics reconsidered their praise. They professed now to discover in his pages crudity, nudity, and all that, blended, however, with power, imagination, and that rather vague specialty commonly known as ""promise;"" and they bade the world wait. So the world has been content to wait, and as the reward of its waiting, it now has Edwin of Deira, republished this side the water by the HARPERS, in their magazine for October, and by TICKNOR & FIELDS in book form.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68990918-7626-56cf-ae0a-afeff13ebb4c,1078,nyt://article/68990918-7626-56cf-ae0a-afeff13ebb4c,

"When the Cotton States set up the standard of rebellion, the Border States at once became the grand theatre of their intrigues, the object of which was to carry them with the South.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/24/archives/kentucky-among-the-breakers.html,,"When the Cotton States set up the standard of rebellion, the Border States at once became the grand theatre of their intrigues, the object of which was to carry them with the South. The National Government was equally desirous of retaining their allegiance, for the reason that so long as this was held, it was believed that the insurrection would fall to the ground of its own weakness. For months it was in the power of these States to have composed the revolt, and restore peace and unity to the country. If Virginia and Kentucky had assumed an attitude dictated by patriotism or manliness, or a sense of self-preservation the rebels would have been awed into submission without the movement of a soldier or the firing of a gun. But the position taken by both was that calculated to make rebellion the power that it is, rather than to support the Government and sustain the laws. While the rebels were either seizing or destroying everything belonging to Government within their reach, and straining every nerve for its subversion and ruin, the Border States planted themselves on the anti-coercion ground, and notified the National authorities that no soldier should cross their soils to enforce the law or protect the forts and property of the United States. As their territories extended from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, their attitude was the very one at the time best calculated to promote the object of the rebellion, and to embarrass the action of the Government. Anti-coercion was the ground upon which the Democratic party, North as well as South, then stood. When neutrality could be no longer preserved, the mask was thrown off in Virginia, as well as by the Executives of both Kentucky and Missouri. Kentucky did not go over to the enemy, but still asserted the right to remain neutral in the contest, the most disgraceful and undignified role a State could possibly assume. No sentiment of patriotism, or sense of duty, or gratitude toward a Government which had been the source of all her honors and prosperity, appeared to animate her people. As far as they inclined in either direction, the whole weight of their influence was thrown in favor of the rebels. Kentucky allowed their army to be recruited from her sons. She supplied their wants when all other avenues were closed to them. Under her fostering care towards them, and indifference towards the Government, the rebellion grew to the vast proportions and power it now displays. She hugged to the idea of neutrality till a military necessity compelled the rebels to throw an immense force into her territory and seize upon its most important strategical points. Kentucky cannot long be neutral. Her Governor takes sides with the rebels, and her Legislature with the National Government. This difference corresponds to an equally marked and virulent one existing throughout the whole State. A majority of her people still maintain their quasi-loyalty, which has been greatly strengthened by the invasion. But the minority make up for inferiority in numbers in earnestness and activity, so that, without aid from the North, the State would undoubtedly be overrun, and annexed, willing or not, to the Southern Confederacy. Sustained by the National troops, she may be enabled to drive back the invaders, but not without a terrible contest, in which she must suffer all the horrors of a civil war on a broader scale, and in a more embittered form, than have yet been enacted in any State.

We have not heard that Miss KEENE ever made any pretence of literary merit in the ""Seven Sisters,"" and in the ""Seven Sons,"" the piece selected for her opening night, she expressly disclaims anything of the kind.

The occasion was the presentation of a stand of colors to the Forty-fifth Regiment German Rifles -- more familiarly known as the Fifth Regiment, in consequence of the enlistment therein of many members of the militia regiment of that designation under command of Col. SCHWARTZWAELDER. The Forty-fifth is, however, commanded by Col. VON AMSBURG, and comprises many new recruits of ability and experience, whose military ardor leads them more to the sober work of war than to the less onerous parades of peace. The Forty-fifth commenced recruiting only on the 17th ult., and on the 9th inst. were mustered into service. The roll yesterday numbered 800 officers and men, and, though the arms are not yet furnished, it is expected that the regiment will proceed to the seat of war on Wednesday or Thursday, to be attached to Gen. BLENKER's Division, and procure arms, as promised by Gen. MCCLELLAN, at the Capital. They will receive -- as have the remainder of the Division -- the Springfield rifle. This is a most appropriate weapon, as most of the men are good shots, and one of the companies at least -- that of Capt. SHOENECKER's -- is composed of sharp-shooters. The men are uniformed in the State blue, and, barring their arms, are nearly equipped.

In this he entirely ignores the sixth section of the act of July 13, which, in express terms, declares that ""any ship or vessel belonging in whole or in part to any citizen or inhabitant of a State declared in a state of insurrection found at sea, or in any part of the rest of the United States, shall be forfeited to the United States."" There is in this section nonqualification or pretence of qualification to the forfeiture. It is absolute. By the common law, when a citizen rebels against the Government to which he owes allegiance, his property, as well as his life, is forfeited, whether his property has been ""used for the promotion of the insurrection"" or not; and the reason is, that when he embarks in the rebellion, the law presumes that he intends to use not only his physical powers in ""promotion"" of the treason he is engaged in, but all his property. The act of rebellion, in legal contemplation, fixes the intent, and it therefore presumes that all the goods, all the money, all the estate and possessions of the rebel, as well as his arm and brain, are used or to be used in aid of accomplishing the overthrow of the Government. Had the Secretary remembered this rule of the common law, he would have found no difficulty, we think, in respect to the forfeiture of rebel property. In construing the statutes creating the forfeiture, he would not have required actual proof of the use, or of the intention to use it ""in promotion of the insurrection."" He would have said that the act of rebellion itself, in legal contemplation, determined the intent so to use it, -- that in law it was so used, from the moment the owner became a rebel, and that the forfeiture therefore attached.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SECRETARY CHASE ON CONFISCATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SECRETARY CHASE ON CONFISCATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d0209f15-8342-5b54-b086-59e92b8cebce,515,nyt://article/d0209f15-8342-5b54-b086-59e92b8cebce,

There were no springs or wells of any kind inside the intrenchments, the supply of water having been entirely drawn from the river. On that side there were no breastworks, and there the hardest fighting took place. The rebels, anticipating the advantage to be gained in cutting off access to the river, procured a large number of bales of hemp, and rolling them gradually along, under their protection succeeded in effecting their object, and thus had the fort completely surrounded. Their overwhelming numbers -- estimated at fully twenty-seven thousand -- rendered a successful sortie, on the part of the little garrison, out of the question, and they were thus enabled to wait until Col. MULLIGAN was compelled to succumb to a more terrible foe. A fair fight, in an open field, with the odds at four to one, was declined by PRICE previous to the surrender. When that event took place, the rebels mounted the breastworks, tore down the National flag and dragged it in the dust. The men were all released on parole on the morning after the surrender, but the officers were retained as prisoners. The National loss during the siege is reported at 37 killed and 140 wounded. That of the rebels is at present unknown, but it is believed to be not less than one thousand. They will probably solace themselves, however, with the plunder which has fallen into their hands in Lexington, including a large sum in gold, stated at a quarter of a million dollars.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/704dc11a-84b4-526c-9d44-ab0140a5b59d,1733,nyt://article/704dc11a-84b4-526c-9d44-ab0140a5b59d,

Nothing is so cal-  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/25/archives/what-we-pay-and-what-we-can-pay.html,,"One of the most encouraging indications of the times is the confidence which the nation is daily acquiring, by a thorough examination of its means and strength. Nothing is so calculated to shake faith in public credit as civil war, which, as its name implies, may paralyze all the functions of a Government by destroying its unity. This remains to us intact, with the greater portion of the people loyal, and possessing by far the larger portion of the property, and nearly all the enterprise of the country. We thus retain that which in modern times is the basis of all power -- financial or monetary strength. The public subscribe eagerly to the new loan, because they are satisfied of the ability of the nation to make good all its obligations. These can. be probably promptly met without resorting, in addition to our ordinary sources of revenue, to more than one or two of those which are so prolific in income to other nations, but which have hitherto been untouched by ourselves. Thus far Customs revenue has been our only resource. The public lands have produced something, but not more than enough to meet the charges of their management, and the annuities to the various Indian tribes. from whom they were purchased. In England, Customs, on an average, produce only one-third of the National revenues. Of the gross sum of $350,000,000. collected the past year, $117,000,000 were received from Customs; $100,000,000 from Excise; $50,000,000 from Income and Property tax; $42,000,000 from Stamps. Of the Customs, $22,000,000 were derived from Wines and Liquors, $28,000,000 from Tobacco, $32,000,000 from Cigars, and $37,000,000 from Tea. As the Excise tax is levied upon beer and spirits home-distilled, liquors, tobacco, tea, and sugar, pay $217,000,000! From similar sources of income the United States, the past year, collected $13,616,467, viz.: From sugars, $8,949,437; from wines and spirits, $3,192,563; from tobacco, $1,374,467; tea having, till the late act of Congress, been admitted by us free of duty. Stamp duties are unknown, and so has been an Income tax, which is now only levied to take effect prospectively; so that from sources that England has been accustomed to raise five-sixths of its revenues, or over $300,000,000 annually, we have, in times past, raised something less than $20,000,000. These sources, so fruitful in the old country, remain yet to be resorted to, except the Income tax. That we shall resort to them, if necessary to carry on the war, or meet the interest and principal of the loans contracted, there can be no doubt. The economy of our Government, and the pacific policy which it has always studiously maintained, has not driven it, as has been the necessities of other Governments, to make taxation a science, which levies and collects so skillfully that the burdens create little complaint, and no great approval, whatever may be the real inconvenience. For the penny a person pays for sipping a cup of tea, or a mug of beer, or glass of wine or brandy, or for puffing a cigar is a trifle easily earned and readily parted with. A smoker pays, perhaps, five pounds annually to Government, whose thrift, for a life time may not have sufficed to accumulate so large a sum. Taxes levied and collected in gross are always burdensome. Were the sums necessary to support the British Government levied in this manner, whether upon processes or results, one-half the amount could never be collected. But by connecting their payment in the smallest sums, with the daily indulgence or avocation of nearly every person in the Kingdom, not the least difficulty is found in raising amounts to us almost fabulous, and which, if necessary, could be vastly increased -- probably doubled. In the Crimean war, the income and property tax went from $27,000,000 to $80,000,000, and fell off at its close to $20,000,000. The ability of the British people to contribute to the support of the Government seems to be unlimited, from the manner in which taxes are levied. Apparently, a third of the whole profits of the labor and capital of the nation could be turned into the National Exchequer, should an occasion arise calling for such a sacrifice. We do not present the system or experience of our mother country as a theme for eulogy or imitation. We hope never to have fastened upon us her social and political systems, which have caused the evils under which she is laboring, and which render their correction, so long as these systems remain, impossible. The ruling classes in that country will not allow their property to be taxed to any considerable extent for the support of Government, but throw the burden upon labor. The miner can drink as much whisky or tea, or use as much tobacco or sugar, as a Lord, and he pays almost as much to the support of the Government, taking the great source of its revenues. In the United States property pays the greater portion of the taxes. Sugar and coffee have for a long time been on the free list. Tobacco we do not import in any considerable quantities. Duties on sugar are almost the only ones in which rich and poor meet pretty much on the same level. But if driven by a temporary stress, we can and shall copy, from the experience of our neighbors. To sustain institutions which are the foundation of their prosperity, and their marvelous material progress, our people will pay more readily than those of other countries, from a more lively sense of benefits received, and of the value of the institutions and Government they are called upon to sustain.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What We Pay, and What We Can Pay.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What We Pay, and What We Can Pay.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7c64dbea-9232-5b6c-9211-c0817d107335,942,nyt://article/7c64dbea-9232-5b6c-9211-c0817d107335,

The defence was that the demand, if any existed, which was denied, had been settled by a bond and mortgage upon real estate in Brooklyn. The allegations in the complaint, amounting to an averment that the action was brought to recover for money received in a fiduciary capacity, and judgment having been rendered in favor of plaintiff for $1,500, an application was made for leave to issue an execution against the person. It appeared in evidence that the defendant had given a deed of the mortgaged property to the plaintiff, and $300 had been allowed therefor on the original claim.

Some time since the Boston Courier asserted, with great emphasis and precision, that at the outbreak of this rebellion, and immediately after the blockade of Baltimore, a conspiracy was formed in New-York for the purpose of dethroning President LINCOLN and installing GEORGE LAW in his stead; and the TIMES was designated as the organ of the conspirators, because we happened, in a hasty paragraph, to use the expression that the President ran some risk of being ""superseded"" in the functions of his office by the aroused and alarmed impatience of the public, just after he had consented that no more troops should pass through Baltimore. This alleged conspiracy is still doing duty with a certain portion of the Press. The semi-Secessionist newspapers of the Democratic stamp, which are much more alarmed at the prospective destruction of their party than at that of the Union, continue to use it, and the Herald, of course, rolls it as a sweet morsel under its forked tongue.

In Missouri two other great armies, of near forty thousand men each, are hurrying to a collision. The National troops under. Gen. FREMONT are anxious to meet the enemy, and wipe out by their courage and prowess the memory of recent disasters; and the rebel forces, flushed with a barren victory, are equally in earnest to increase their laurels by new triumphs. That there will be immense slaughter when at either point these forces shall come in conflict, there can be no doubt. The rebel cause hangs suspended on the issue. If they shall be beaten, as we feel morally certain they will be, the great rebellion, which will occupy so prominent a place in history, will be practically subdued. A lingering campaign or two may have to be carried on, -- a scattered and hopeless resistance at certain points may remain to be overcome, but the backbone of the revolt will have been broken. A victory in Missouri, and that State will be fixed as a star in the Union, and all impediments in the way of the expedition that is to sweep down the Valley of the Mississippi will be removed. If MCCLELLAN shall be victor on the Potomac, the way will be open for the central column to advance in a triumphal march to Richmond on its way to the Gulf. No rally can ever be made by the rebel Army after a defeat on the Potomac. It will disappear as the locusts before the east wind.

"Few have pretended to give, and fewer still have succeeded in giving, a consistent view of the casus belli in America. The truth is, that wars generally spring from mixed motives, and can seldom be traced to a single cause. Who can say whether CHARLEMAGNE's wars were wars of empire, or wars of race, or wars of religion? Who would undertake to prove that zeal for Catholicism, or dynastic ambition, or the instinct of self-aggrandizement, or any other of the many reasons that might be imagined, was the secret of such contests as those between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, or the Thirty Years' War? But never was the origin of a great struggle more inscrutable than that of the one now raging. As in the case of those fires that have lately terrified this metropolis, the causes of the mischief have been almost obliterated by its rapid progress and ruinous effects. Future historians may perhaps detect the dominant element in the great fermentation of passions and interests, but we shall not affect to do so. One or two things, indeed, we do know, for the event has already revealed them. Commercial jealousy, or rather a natural impatience of monopoly, certainly had its share in breaking up the Union. A longing for independence, with a fixed resolve to make the South the centre of a new experiment in Government, has shown itself too clearly to be mistaken. Long bickerings and mutual antipathies, only differing in their scale from those which are daily dragged to light in Sir C. CRESWELL's Court, may have found expression in a fierce demand for a national divorce. Idle, however, as it would be to seek in any or all of these predisposing circumstances the ultimate cause of a fact but half realized, we are not altogether at the mercy of conjecture. It is easier to say what is not than what may thus I dismiss is the notion that ""the liberty of the African' race"" is the gage of battle. We do not mean to argue that it is a mere accident that the fracture took place at the point of junction between the Slave and Free States, or that Abolitionist principles had nothing to do with Mr. LINCOLN's election. Doubtless the Republicans were in earnest about checking the spread of Slavery into the Territories, and the Southerners felt their defeat as a rebuke to their pecular institutions. But that this was not the true object of the  movement on either side, even at its the outset, admits of every proof short of demonstration, and that the Slavery question has since been utterly lost in the melee of civil war, is capable of actual demonstration. Mr. LINCOLN volunteered pledge after pledge that he would be no party to Abolitionist measures. In the great majority of messages, addresses, and party manifestoes that have since been issued, Slavery is altogether thrust into the background. Its maintenance is not the war-cry of the South; its abolition is not the war-cry of the North. Free trade, foreign policy, national sovereignty, social superiority, even civilization, -- anything rather than the old watchword of domestic rights, has been the shibboleth of the Secessionists. On the other hand, the Northern Press and the Northern Army have equally forgotten the ""idea"" which might have sanctified their arms in the eyes of many excellent persons. So far from inviting servile insurrections, their Generals have in some cases threatened to put them down, and in others returned fugitive slaves who had escaped to their camps, while no abatement of the slave laws has been promised in the event of the ""rebellion,"" as it is still called at Washington, being suppressed.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/26/archives/the-american-struggle-its-object-not-emancipation.html,,"Few have pretended to give, and fewer still have succeeded in giving, a consistent view of the casus belli in America.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/26/archives/general-city-news.html,,"TRIAL OF A DUMMY ENGINE ON THE HUDSON RIVER RAILROAD. -- The new dummy engine, just completed by the Hudson River Railroad Company, for running cars from the station at Thirtyfirst-street to the depot in Chambers-street, was subjected to a trial of its merits, yesterday, in presence of a majority of the members of the Common Council, and other citizens. The Railroad Company have spent much time and money in perfecting the improvements contained in this engine, and, in the unanimous judgment of those who witnessed its operation yesterday, they have now attained complete success. The dummy is entirely free from any possible objection that can be urged against it as a street-engine; in fact, it is more safe, and less a nuisance, than the horse-cars now in use, while at the same time it is sufficiently powerful to meet the wants of the Railroad Company. The engine is entirely concealed from view in a car resembling a passenger-car; no smoke or steam is emitted, (the former being avoided by the use of coke, and the latter being condensed as fast as used, by passing through a water tank with which the car is lined,) and yet it is capable of drawing ten loaded cars at the lawful rate of speed, and can be stopped almost instantaneously. In the trial trip from Chambers-street to Thirty-first-street, yesterday, three cars were attached, loaded with passengers, and, by actual test, the train was brought to a dead stand, while moving at the legal rate of speed, in three seconds and a half. The train was several times stopped in a distance of from four to six feet from the time the signal was given. So far as danger to pedestrians is concerned, it was pronounced by all to be superior to horse-power, while its liability to frighten horses is no greater than that of an ordinary passenger-car. It appears that the Hudson River Railroad were several years ago permitted, by. resolution of the Common Council, to run a dummy engine between their two stations, which they did for a short time; but, owing to a want of capacity and other defects in the dummies then in use, they were finally abandoned, and the old horse-power was again resorted to. And now when, at a great expense, they have just overcome the difficulties, and are about to restore the dummy, the Board of Aldermen have rescinded the resolution allowing them to use it. The rescinding resolution is now before the Board of Councilmen for their indorsement, which, judging from the opinions expressed yesterday, it will never get.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8d07dde1-caa6-51dc-8e1b-ca597aaf532b,1545,nyt://article/8d07dde1-caa6-51dc-8e1b-ca597aaf532b,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/27/archives/discourse-by-rev-dr-weston-government-a-divine-ordinance-and-as.html,,"The Baptist church, corner of Broome and Elizabeth streets, Was most densely and uncomfortably crowded yesterday afternoon -- every possible standing, sitting or seeing spot being occupied. Owing to a mistake in the hour of service, as announced, a delay of half an hour took place, which was improved by an improvised prayer meeting, in which Rev. Mr. SOMMERS and others took part. The sermon was preached by Rev. Dr. WESTON, who had been unanimously selected by the Conference of Pastors, and who took his text from 1 Kings, chap. viii., verse 57: ""The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not leave us, nor forsake us."" The sermon was a finished and didactic discourse. He claimed that patriotism was a Christian virtue, implanted in the hearts of man by the Divine hand. No nation on earth had so glorious a history as our own, and none the promise of so glorious a future, but if we were to stifle patriotism, our name as a nation would rot, and we would, instead of a blessing, leave a curse to those whom we have robbed of that fair heritage. Our Government has a building designed of God, and could we stand supine when men were ruthlessly attempting to subvert it? There were even now blind Sampsons in our midst, feeling about for the pillars, that they might tear them from them places, and involve the whole fabric in one common ruin. It was, therefore, our duty to pray for our Government, and our country which God had given us. It should be impressed upon every heart that Government was an ordinance of God, and that in yielding obedience to it, we were yielding to God's voice, and that alone would be worth to us all the war could cost. But if we felt that war depended on human sufferance, its ruin was certain, and it must perish as surely as that everything human perishes. Government was made for the people, and woe to that man who attempted to divert it from the people. It could not be entertained that God, who had desired all things for man's good, should have left this to men to establish for themselves, only to be subject to human caprices and changes. Divine Providence always was on the side of established Governments, and when a man goes forth to fight for his Government, he fights for a divine and not a human organization. Our Government overflows with blessings to all under it. It watches over fathers, sons and brothers. Its glorious flag floats in every port to protect those who live under it, and its shield is more potential than that of Rome in her most glorious days, and in fact we have best known that we had a Government by its blessings. The destruction of this Confederacy was sought for by some because they thought more money could be made by its destruction; and those who so thought, had emblazoned on their banner, ""Cotton is King."" Even some men were to be found at the North who could coolly calculate the value of our Government and say, ""Let the South go -- we can make more money without her."" The South says that we at the North are fighting for a sentiment, while they were fighting for their homes and firesides -- and, therefore, they must prevail. He admitted the proposition, but denied the inference. The speaker proceeded to draw a comparison between the evils attendant upon the conditions of war and peace, and contended that those of peace, though less sensibly felt, were the most dangerous and insidious. This war had aroused the spirits of all patriots; it had abolished all distinctions of politics and ties of party. Nor were the disasters which had thus far attended our arms a cause for the abatement of hope, and he instanced the history of Benjamin and Judah, where the latter, after twice encountering defeat at the hands of Benjamin, having been commanded by the Lord to go forth and meet him, went forth a third time to God, and asked if it was his will they should go out again; and again they were ordered to go forth, but on this occasion with the promise of the Lord, ""Be sure on that day I, even I, will be with you;"" and in that contest Judah triumphed. So it would be with us, if we remembered our God, and put our trust in his Divine mercy and power. The speaker closed with an earnest exhortation to prayer, so that this day should be an era in the Nation's history, of a whole people coming to God in penitence for the past and hope for the future.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISCOURSE BY REV.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/27/archives/united-states-circulating-notes.html,,"Congress at its recent War session directed, in the general Loan act, the use by the Treas- ury of any part of fifty million dollars in United States Notes of Circulation, of small denominations, not below five dollars, payable on demand at New-York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati or St. Louis. Twenty millions in these Notes, of fives, tens and twenties, have been prepared under direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and are now being circulated as rapidly as they can be signed and registered at the Department, though not as fast as the public all over the country would like to take them, in place of gold coin, for the Government dues. They were promptly approved and warmly recommended for the Army by an order from the veteran Lieutenant-General, WINFIELD SCOTT. For Army payments they are eagerly accepted, as the greatest imaginable convenience to all ranks, and by none with more grateful promptness than by the common soldier in our volunteer Army. The alternative of gold coin at the same time is not withheld, but the Paymasters at Fortress Monroe report that six out of seven of the men and officers give preference to the United States Circulating Notes. At Arlington, twelve out of nineteen thousand dollars paid to a single regiment, some days ago, were in these Notes. At the Sub-Treasury in this City, where there is yet no adequate supply of the Notes for original distribution, the Cashier is every day applied to to repay out the Notes which return from Washington and the West for redemption, which he is doing to the full extent of these redemptions. At the West they are received with the greatest favor by all the people and by all moneyed institutions in Cincinnati, Chicago, &c., a rumor put afloat in this city to the contrary notwithstanding. There is no good reason why this should not be so. The United States Notes are not so much employed for the profit as for the convenience of the Treasury. They are not made so much to create a money capital at Washington as to save the undue disturbance of the Money markets on the seaboard by the frequent and heavy transfers of gold coin to the interior for Army purposes, where such coin is intrinsically less valuable to the trade of the country than these United States Notes, payable in coin on the seaboard, to which all the interior exchanges inevitably tend. At the North and East they are universally acceptable among the people. The exceptions among the bankers are quite rare, and confined, as we believe, to certain parties in this City, who have made the exclusive bullion system a sort of hobby. At the general Bank Convention of the three great cities, on the 15th of August, these parties were left in a small minority on making the question of interference with the National circulation. Since then the bankers of Philadelphia have unanimously reaffirmed their sanction of United States Notes redeemable on demand, and from Boston we have yet to hear the first word of objection.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'United States Circulating Notes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'United States Circulating Notes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Currency', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/24a48e7b-0dbf-5734-a8ad-3d447052bed1,636,nyt://article/24a48e7b-0dbf-5734-a8ad-3d447052bed1,

He, however, read a portion of the 80th Psalm as being especially appropriate to the occasion. We had met together, he said, under the pressure of a great calamity and peril to our country as a nation. It was not the peril which at one time threatened Washington -- not the peril of a violation of the blockade -not the peril of universal bankruptcy -- from all these we had emerged. It was a greater peril than any of these, for the rebellion aimed to strike a death-blow upon popular liberty. He should speak of this danger and its remedy. He defined this popular liberty, of which we were in the enjoyment, and contrasted it with the liberty enjoyed by the people of less favored nations. The measures which had been adopted by the Government for preserving it, in the suppression of newspapers and the establishment of martial law, met his hearty approbation. They were measures of military necessity, consequent upon the action of the leaders of the Southern people, who would strike down every right of the people in the aggregate and detail, to substitute therefor a military despotism. After mentioning the privileges resulting. from popular liberty -- a free Press, feee discussion, and popular suffrage -- all of which the success of this monstrous insurrection would forever destroy, he said that the rebellion also assaulted the right of the Republic to exist as a Government, by its fallacious doctrine of secession.

"If every natural law that man turns to his account and makes his servant, instead of being his master, is a triumph of his genius,  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/27/archives/strength-and-prosperity-of-the-north-in-the-period-of-civil-war.html,,"If every natural law that man turns to his account and makes his servant, instead of being his master, is a triumph of his genius, how much greater must that be when he recasts a continent and adapts it to his convenience and his will. The colonists of this country found its great rivers -- its natural highways -- discharging their waters two thousand miles from the future seats of commerce, wealth and population of the Atlantic slope fronting the Old World. They speedily set to work to correct this oversight of nature. A whole continent had to be reformed. The outlet of the great lakes was diverted into the magnificent estuary of the Hudson -- the Mississippi into the great lakes -- so that the two great rivers of the continent, watering its fairest portions, and a territory unequaled in the world for the productiveness of its soil and salubrity of its climate, were, in effect, turned into our harbor, and flow past our docks and wharves, bringing to us a commerce greater in bulk and value of the kind than that of any other country in the world. In peace it was a grand spectacle, and a source of untold wealth. In war, it is the stay and support both of the Government and people, and the astonishment of other nations, who judged of the effect of a civil war in this country by their own experience. They could be brought to an understanding of our condition and strength only by facts which are every day forced upon them by the freedom and extent of our internal commerce. The country really needs no other outlet for its products than the harbor of New-York. The great system of public works resting upon it, penetrates nearly every county of each State, and afford not only the most expeditious, but, in most instances, the cheapest routes to markets, whether at home or abroad. Every Southern port closed, swells the commerce of our own. Up to this period in the season, the Southern embargo has affected only breadstuffs and provisions that were wont to go down the Mississippi. These are all turned north, and come to us over our railroads and canals. We have no statement of the increased traffic of the former, for the present year, as these only report yearly, but we get weekly accounts from the canals. The excess of breadstuffs over last year, which have already reached tide-water through this avenue, equals 10,000,000 bushels; the quantity for the past year being 23,000,000, for the present 33,000,000 bushels. The increase of traffic on the railroads has probably been in still greater ratio. The total quantity brought to tide-water the past year by the Erie and Central Railroads, and the Erie Canal, was 73,000,000 bushels; the present year it will exceed 100,000,000, giving us for exportation, in addition for what is wanted for domestic consumption, a quantity valued at the lowest estimate, at $100,000,000.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Strength and Prosperity of the North in the Period of Civil War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Strength and Prosperity of the North in the Period of Civil War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/532d4884-31eb-5742-bf5c-3741adba0423,950,nyt://article/532d4884-31eb-5742-bf5c-3741adba0423,

After some-preliminary observations explanatory of the text, he drew a parallel between the rebellion of Absalom, the son of King David, and the present rebellion, instigated by the sons of King Cotton. ""The wretched conspiracy,"" said the speaker, ""which was instigated by that rebel son of David, has perhaps no parallel in the whole history of the world, save in this equally shameless and causeless rebellion instituted by the sons of the South. The rebel Absalom, we are told in the context, must needs begin his nefarious scheme of plotting to overthrow his father's kingdom by sending out spies through all the tribes of Israel; and we find a striking coincidence in the fact that this work of rebellion was begun in the southern part of the King's dominions. What is there in the mild breezes of the ""Sunny South"" to inspire treachery and rebellion? Thanks be to Heaven, not every one who is native of a Southern clime is traitor to his home, his country and his God! From personal acquaintance, I know that throughout the States of Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee there are some whose love of country is stronger than the ties of consanguinity, and holier than that for money or kindred. But nothing on earth or in Heaven is too holy to be sacrificed by a traitor. He who will plot treason against the land that gave him birth, and against the Government which from earliest infancy has protected him in his life, his liberty and his pursuit of happiness, is to be trusted never. He is a rebel all over, and would betray the mother that bore him and the God who gave him life. Traitors have existed in all ages of the world, but their nature is everywhere the same -- wicked beyond comparison. In the infancy of this country, a BENEDICT ARNOLD sought to betray the cause he had espoused, but what shall we think of men who seek the entire overthrow of the best and most benign Government the world has ever seen?

As an instance, he quoted France, which paid the penalty of her persecution of the Huguenots, by the withdrawal of their industry from their fatherland. The circumstances of assembling to-day were well known to every one. A gigantic array of rebels had assembled to dismember the Union, and should we ever submit to their demands, no treaty of peace could ever suppress the inevitable breaking out of the smoldering flame engendered by the rancor of the present contest. The great and only permanent remedy must be the crushing out forever this unholy rebellion. This is the unanimous opinion of twenty millions of men at the North, who are sympathized with by a large number of Union men at the South; for it was no use to inquire now, whether the present state of things was brought about by the impertinent intemperance of Northern Abolitionists, or the work of disappointed Southern politicians; as Mr. STEPHENS, the Vice-President of the seceding Confederacy declared only a few months ago; for the thousands of miles or fertile country is now devastated by war; thousands of brave hearts now engaged in the struggle will cease to breathe, leaving widows and orphans to mourn their loss.

OUTWITTED. -- The Coney Island Railroad Company some months ago secured the right of way for their road through Brooklyn -- so far as the city authorities could grant it, -- but they found some difficulty about laying their rails in South-street, between Fulton-avenue and State-street. It seems that Ex-Mayor SAMUEL SMITH originally opened this street for the benefit of his own property, and he alleges that in ceding it to the city he reserved some control over the street -- sufficient, at all events, to stop the laying of rail tracks there. The managers of the road coaxed and threatened, but in return they were threatened with an injunction in case they attempted to tear up the street. The Company found there was no use in attempting to avail themselves of the ordinary methods of obtaining possession of the street without a long litigation, so they resorted to strategy. Thursday having been appointed as a National Fast-day, when it would be impossible to obtain an injunction from any of the Courts, they arranged to put 300 men at work upon the street at an early hour in the morning, and before night the track was laid and the dirt and rubbish moved away. Mr. SMITH, when he saw what was going on, applied to a judge for an injunction, but was told that none could be granted on that day, and he returned home a wiser man. This, it is believed, was the only regular work done on Thursday, and the Railroad Company excuse this on the ground of public necessity.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09ab1e15-3a52-5bf4-bc5a-fdb7eadcb737,875,nyt://article/09ab1e15-3a52-5bf4-bc5a-fdb7eadcb737,

Advertisements and posters abound in engagements which the Government has not undertaken to fulfill, and the fulfillment of which would be a practical impossibility. Before the close of the war, it is probable that three-quarters of a million of soldiers will have seen service and become entitled, one as much as the other, to whatever bounties Congress might be disposed to bestow. If such bounties were to take the shape of money, they would call for the outlay of nearly a hundred millions of dollars; if they were to be given in land, they would require more than a hundred millions of acres. Such donations are simply impracticable. It is sufficient for the soldier to know that he is to be well paid, well clad; well sheltered, and cared for in case of sickness; that he will be enabled to make his pay available for the support of his dependents; that if disabled he will be provided for by a pension -- a pension that will be paid to his family in case of death.

Kansas is at this moment in most imminent danger of a second subjugation by the ProSlavery rebel-ruffians of Missouri and of the Southwest.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/28/archives/imminent-danger-of-kansas.html,,"Kansas is at this moment in most imminent danger of a second subjugation by the ProSlavery rebel-ruffians of Missouri and of the Southwest. Its fate may be said to hangupon the issue of the impending battle at Lexington, but a few miles from its eastern border. If we suffer another defeat there, Kansas falls. No wonder the settlers of that young and free, but thrice-desolated State, are preparing for defence with the energy of desperation, for the time is short. It is now known that it has all along been BEN MCCULLOCH's scheme to subjugate Kansas first; that once accomplished, he and the Secessionists of Western Missouri would have allies on all sides, excepting only the Iowa border; and he could then make Kansas the base of operations against the loyal citizens of North Missouri. He would thus also divert the Kansas regiments and the other National troops in Missouri to a field where he could carry on his peculiar style of warfare with the greatest advantage to himself, and with the least damage and danger to the sacred soil of Secessiondom. Ever since the battle at Springfield, large bodies of the rebels, under RAINS and others, have been gathering and foraying along the Southeastern border of Kansas, from Fort Scott up as far as the Kansas River; and so serious have been the menaces against Leavenworth, and other river towns, that all citizens are now called out for military duty daily. Only yesterday, the telegraph reported that MCCULLOCH, with 15,000 men, was within a few miles of the Kansas line on the night of the 21st inst.; and although it is not likely that he will now make any serious demonstration against the State until after the impending fight at Lexington, the fact of his hovering so long, and with such large force, along the border, shows sufficiently what are his designs. It is highly probable, too, that, since the battle at Springfield, MCCULLOCH has made another visit to the Indian Nations in the Territory to the south of Kansas, and got them in readiness for an advance movement whenever he shall give the signal. A short time since, the Fort Smith (Ark.) Times gave a list of companies of red men that had been raised in the various tribes by Capt. ALBERT PIKE and Gen. D.H. COOPER; and told us that the savages were thirsting to begin the work of butchery. The tribes there number 70,000 souls, and it is supposed can bring into the field eight or ten thousand warriors, who would form a most effective auxiliary in border warfare. Kansas has thus a savage enemy on her front and at her flank, and a howling desert in the rear.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Imminent Danger of Kansas,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Imminent Danger of Kansas,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/27a6dc1d-2f41-5773-a086-52d1e9e724a2,1125,nyt://article/27a6dc1d-2f41-5773-a086-52d1e9e724a2,

The same remarkable facility of manipulation is noticeable in all that he does; the same astounding ease in making all sorts of things disappear. In the latter way a very beautiful trick was introduced for the first time. It was effected somewhat in this fashion: Mr. HERMANN walked among the audience and casually plucked from coat-collars three live canaries. These he placed in an ordinary bird-cage. Then producing a. glass box, he transferred the birds to its depths. Here they hopped about until they were placed under the thin folds of a silk handkerchief, held in the hands of Mr. HERMANN. You could see the shape of the glass case distinctly. But presently shaking out the bandanna, the cage, together with the birds, disappeared. It is not easy to describe the effect which a feat of this kind produces on the spectator, but we may measure its excellence by the hearty applause which ensued. Mr. HERMANN's sleight-of-hand is so very clean and unembarrassed that it places his performances on a totally different level to any that have ever been seen in this City. In the new programme which he has now brought before the public, he is seen to the most pleasant advantage.

It appears that he was walking along Meadow-street, Hoboken, when he was suddenly confronted by Mrs. WM. LAVENCE, residing near by, who commenced laying a horsewhip over Mr. WILSON's shoulders with great vigor. WILSON finally gained possession of the whip, when the lady, in the presence of quite a gathering, resorted to another weapon -- her tongue -- by which means she relieved her mind at a rapid and violent rate. She especially invited Mr. WILSON to cause her arrest in order that she could ""expose his villainy,"" as she said, ""practiced under the cloak of religion."" Mr. WILSON very obligingly granted the request, and Mrs. LAVENCE gave $200 for her appearance at Court.

It was well for them that they did, for the Park, like an aesthetical boa-constrictor, crushed what it did not swallow. To make money it was necessary to play at the Park; to know anything of acting it was necessary to have graduated from that Temple of the Muses. Critics of easy virtue wrote tremendous disquisitions on the affinity of all that was truly great with all that was done at the Park, and actors at the Park, breathing the salubrious atmosphere of Mount Parnassus, looked down, like gods, upon common people. About this time there arrived in this country a gentleman whom we now call the ""veteran manager."" He was in the prime of life; gifted with rare talents as an artist, and still rarer faculties as a manager. For some reason he did not ""sec"" the Park. Doubtless he was told, as we are even now told, that it was the best place of amusement in the world. Some eminent tragedian, smelling strongly of tobacco, undoubtedly recommended him with exuberant generosity to try the provinces. But shutting his eyes alike to perfection and disinterestedness, this new-comer resolved to open a theatre of his own. You may imagine if you like the jokes of the low comedy man, the lofty scorn of the leading tragedian, the sarcastic considerateness of the manager, and the beery doubts of the critics, when the news became known in the purlieus of the Park Theatre. If, in our day, the Governor of Coney Island were to send a missive to the Mayor of New-York, warning him to remove the women and children, because it was his intention to bombard the City within twenty-four hours, the surprise could not be greater. But the public, which looks to facts, accepted the thing with favor. Mr. WALLACK opened his theatre, and from that day to this has been quietly accepted as the best manager we have ever had. The rosy fiction that nothing could surpass the glories of the Park, has vanished into that very thin air which old and superseded actors are apt to use when they ""blow "" about their former triumphs.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Wallack's Theatre."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Wallack's Theatre."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e0a9dcde-7811-53c4-8313-43daec3bacfb,1289,nyt://article/e0a9dcde-7811-53c4-8313-43daec3bacfb,

The publishers are alarmed for a supply of printing paper, for while they have any amount of material in the shape of cotton for making it, the manufacturers cannot obtain the chemicals necessary for its perfection.

All they comprehend is the decrease of their present gains, and the prospect of being compelled to pay a few dollars of increased taxation. They care nothing for national honor, nothing for the Constitution and the Union. They would sacrifice all these to their own lust of acquisition.

For month the insurgents have devoted themselves to the construction of powerful batteries at various points on the river; patiently toiling at their completion and armament, without exciting premature alarm by firing into our naval vessels and transports; which, nevertheless, reported constantly at Washington the progress of such threatening works. We have now proof that wherever the river narrowed, so as to bring the passing vessel within reach of guns placed upon the shore, guns of the most destructive character have been placed in formidable numbers, and, as we have every reason to believe, with men enough not only to work but to defend them. With the stream thus thoroughly enfiladed, so that a vessel must substantially run the gauntlet of miles of rifled cannon, the river may be regarded as hermetically sealed.

When her money was exhausted, he induced her, by false statements, to part with her jewelry, from time to time, until, at length, she learned to her surprise, that it had all been pawned under a fictitious name, he keeping the money received on it. When her jewelry and other property was all gone, the complainant for the first learned that she had been deceived; that MONTGOMERY had a wife and child living in this City, and that she had been defrauded of her property.

MCCLELLAN, who, in the afternoon, went over with his staff, and sent forward Gen. RICHARDSON, with a body of troops, to take possession of the latter. This he did, without opposition, and found that the rebels had taken everything of value with them. Eight regiments were immediately moved forward, with sufficient support, and the hill will be permanently held by our troops. The probable reason for the evacuation is the fact that the hill is commanded by Upton's Hill, which was already in our possession, and the rebels feared an attack, which they could not successfully resist.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'California', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-09-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c01245a3-4611-5f64-b2aa-f4cacfd5400b,1732,nyt://article/c01245a3-4611-5f64-b2aa-f4cacfd5400b,

"A man living at Nantyglo, who keeps pigeons, a few days ago came to the resolution to decrease his number by shooting some of the young birds, taking care he did not injure one of the old ones. This was rather a difficulty, but after he had shifted from one side to the other for some time, with the loaded gun in his hand, four of the young birds stood well for a shot, and he fired. Down fell three pigeons, quite dead, and a fourth, being winged, fluttered about. But the shot produced other results more remarkable. Seven panes of glass in a house in the distance were broken, and a basin of broth and spoon were thrown down, the basin being broken and the broth spilt. The crash so startled a man who was at dinner, and who had not been able to move for rheumatism for months without his crutches, that he ran to the front door without them this time, and commenced jumping about in front of the house, declaring that he was shot in the forehead, although there was no mark to be seen.

Founded by one revolution,  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/29/archives/memoirs-of-m-guizot-the-government-of-louis-philippe-morit-of-the-m.html,,"Of all the reigns known in history, few, itany, offer so much interest, invite so much the attention of the thinker and the statesman, as that of LOUIS PHILIPPE. Founded by one revolution, destroyed by another, the eighteen years of its existence are filled by the honest attempts of the King and his Ministers to settle upon a firm basis the form of Government best suited to the French people. That which makes this reign still more interesting is, that during these eighteen years no form of freedom, however liberal, was denied them. Like us, they received the freedom of association, of the Press, and of speech, from the hands of the Government they had called to power. From 1830 to 1832, France was enjoying as much freedom -- universal suffrage excepted -- as England or the United States. She had her clubs, her meetings, her private and public associations; her Press, as free as our own, was allowed to speak with as little restraint as any of the secession papers now printed in the City of New-York. As to parliamentary freedom, which, by the way, was never restricted as long as LOUIS PHILIPPE was in power, it has oftentimes been admitted, even by English writers, that it compared favorably with parliamentary freedom in Great-Britain. French justice, celebrated all over the world for its impartiality and independence of the Government, uninfluenced by politics, equally distant from popular as from courtly favor, was exercised by enlightened and upright judges, who applied all their cares to the maintenance of the Constitution and laws of the country without any regard for the revolutionary, passions howling at their doors and threatening their lives. The French clergy, though unfavorable to LOUIS PHILIPPE's administration, though wanting in respect for its policy, and in affection and devotedness to his dynasty, remained neutral and obedient. The agricultural, industrial and commercial interests of the nation received all possible encouragements -- letters, arts and science were encouraged; the navy, and army increased; a new science, political economy, the principles of which have been applied by the present Emperor to his international relations with England and Belgium, and the effects of which are likely to modify deeply, not only the position of the working classes at home, but also the future policy of the world, began to be cultivated in France at that epoch, and the name of MICHEL CHEVALIER, BASTIAT, BLANQUI, the great political economists of this age, became popular all over the world. In fact, there is not one of the improvements introduced by LOUIS NAPOLEON which had not previously been matured and planned by the Government of LOUIS PHILIPPE; and it needs only to look at the names of the men who illustrate the present Government in the field of science, literature and arts, nearly all of whom belong to the preceding reign, to know what, would have been its greatness had it been allowed to exist longer, instead of being superseded by the revolution of 1848.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MEMOIRS OF M.

Their decision, from their position, power and political influence, was regarded by the South, if favorable to it, as decisive of its success; by the North as giving such strength to the rebellion as to involve a war on a vast scale for its subjugation. It was for those States to say whether harmony should be restored to the nation, perhaps without firing a gun, or whether the country should be deluged in blood. The South sought to carry them with it, to precipitate the crisis; the North to retain them, to avoid it. To this end the Government made sacrifices compatible neither with its dignity nor strength. It was willing to try every expedient before resorting to arms. We all know the process and the result. Every Border State, although several professed to maintain their allegiance, either secretly sided with the rebellion, or took a position almost equally calculated to strengthen it. All denied the right to coerce the rebels.

The evacuation of Munson's Hill by the troops of Gen. BEAUREGARD marks an important stage in the progress of military events at Washington.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/30/archives/the-armies-before-washington.html,,"The evacuation of Munson's Hill by the troops of Gen. BEAUREGARD marks an important stage in the progress of military events at Washington. The position was one of singular consequence to that one of the parties who could seize and maintain it. A height of greater elevation than others nearer the Capital, it was within easy shooting distance of Forts Corcoran and Albany. With rifled cannon it could inflict serious damage upon those tremendous works, and there were military authorities who believed it could render them both untenable. It was even pronounced possible, by the use of the more recently improved artillery and projectiles, to shell and burn Washington itself from this commanding eminence. And as almost simultaneously with the occupation of the hill, and the commencement of fortifications upon it, the enemy seized and began to intrench Mason's Hill, a mile and a quarter to the southward, and Edsall's Hill, in the same range, upon the line of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, thus completing a new line of works extending from Vienna to the neighborhood of Alexandria, there was apparently an intention of prosecuting the investment of the Capital with so much vigor as to compel Gen. MCCLELLAN to abandon his intrenchments and attack theirs, as the only means of defeating their project. The premature abandonment of the several points we have named shows their plans to have been very different from this. From the beginning of the war the rebels have manifested no disposition to risk a contest with equality of numbers in the open field. They have in no instance, either in Virginia or Missouri, offered battle upon such conditions; and they have only fought so, even when in greatly superior force, when surprised, as at Wilson's Creek, or Carthage, and compelled to accept the contest. And in all conflicts in the open field, whatever their numbers, they have uniformly been beaten. The policy of Gen. BEAUREGARD is dictated by this distrust of his men. It is absolutely necessary for him to fight without delay; but it is also indispensable to the safety of the cause he contends for, that he should not fight without winning. Hence it is not his purpose to risk an engagement without his defensive lines to fall back upon; much less is it any part of his plan to storm the lines of Arlington. The occupation of Munson's Hill and the ranging heights was, therefore, simply a lure to draw Gen. MCCLELLAN from his intrenchments. It was hoped the National commander, chafing at the audacious proximity of the rebel force, would forthwith attack it; and the conflict once inaugurated, it would be easy to retreat slowly to the protection of the same formidable batteries which shot death and confusion among our men at Bull Run. Thus another victory would be gained, with this advantage to the rebels, that they would know that they had it early enough to follow it up vigorously and gain Washington. The whole of this astute strategy Gen. MCCLELLAN has probably understood. He has resisted the temptation; and the enemy, disappointed in his experiment, and driven to some more promising method of attaining his capital object, has abandoned Munson's Hill and the hills to the southward. We shall not be surprised to learn that his entire force has been withdrawn to the southward of Centreville.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Armies Before Washington.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Armies Before Washington.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/281aac43-23d7-50cd-b56a-050a4504cd1f,1249,nyt://article/281aac43-23d7-50cd-b56a-050a4504cd1f,

We speak from God and his word, when we demand that our Government, by the power committed to them of God for good, for a terror of evil doers, break the arm of the oppressor, the right arm of this rebellion, and let the oppressed go free. We speak from God, and at His command, when we call upon our Government to keep the fast, which they themselves have appointed, in professed recognition of the authority of God and His word, for the whole nation -- when we call upon them to keep that fast themselves, in the very way that God has enjoined, by breaking every yoke, and putting down this hideous and blood-thirsty rebellion, by destroying its central power and wickedness. Let them advance to its central shrine, and cut down its moloch of Slavery from his throne, and open the prison doors of the millions still fattened for his sacrifices; let them do this, and the priests of that hellish Confederacy will fly howling from its altars, and the armies of the Confederacy will be disbanded in terror, and a free people will take the prophets of this Baal and let none of them escape.

We speak from God and his word, when we demand that our Government, by the power committed to them of God for good, for a terror of evil doers, break the arm of the oppressor, the right arm of this rebellion, and let the oppressed go free. We speak from God, and at His command, when we call upon our Government to keep the fast, which they themselves have appointed, in professed recognition of the authority of God and His word, for the whole nation -- when we call upon them to keep that fast themselves, in the very way that God has enjoined, by breaking every yoke, and putting down this hideous and blood-thirsty rebellion, by destroying its actual power and wickedness. Let them advance to its central shrine, and cut down its moloch of Slavery from his throne, and open the prison doors of the millions still fattened for his sacrifices; let them do this and the priests of that hellish Confederacy will fly howling from its altars, and the armies of the Confederacy will be disbanded in terror, and a free people will take the prophets of this Band and let none of them escape. The people, indeed, are longing for the Government to give the signal for this righteous exercise of power.",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""DR.

The Stock Market closed steady on Saturday, the Government Stocks and Treasury Notes being firm on the above arrangement. Within the last forty-eight hours, important changes have been made in the disposition of the two armies now fronting each other across the Potomac. The evacuation of Munson's Hill, it appears, was but one movement in the general retirement of the rebel lines. Munson's Hill, Upton's Hill, Fall's Church, and other important strategic points lately occupied by the enemy, are now in possession of the National troops, who will hold them until it becomes proper to take up still more advanced positions. Fall's Church was occupied early yesterday morning by the pickets from Gen. SMITH's Division, without opposition. His subsequent advance from the Chain Bridge, with a considerable force to occupy the place permanently, was marked by another of the blunders which seem to be inseparable from the movements of our troops, the first of which occurred before the battle of Great Bethel. Col. OWEN's Irish Regiment, from Philadelphia, mistaking, in the darkness, some of our own troops for rebels, fired upon them, killing and wounding several. The mistake was not discovered until the fire had been returned with like fatal effect. The meaning of this general retirement of the rebels is, of course, left to conjecture; but it is believed in Washington to be intended as a feint, made in order to draw our troops out of their intrenchments, and induce an engagement.

There has not been such a lack of business during any period within the last five years. Until recently, the difficulty has been to select a few of the best men from the numbers who presented themselves for enlistment; but now the difficulty is to get men of any kind. The standard has been reduced from five feet four and a half to five feet three inches, without effect. The next step will probably be the suspension of the regulation prohibiting the enlistment of married men. This regulation forbids officers to enlist married men, or men with children, ""except in time of war,"" but it is now observed even mere rigidily than it was twelve months ago; or rather the officers are more particular in their inquiries as to whether an applicant is married or not.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-09-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f8cf28f5-c94f-505f-b194-e661ff6e77a3,626,nyt://article/f8cf28f5-c94f-505f-b194-e661ff6e77a3,

The blockade, which the National Government has established over their coasts, by cutting them off from their usual supplies of the products of the useful arts, must, bring keenly home to that proud and indocile race the value of those industries which have been so long despised. When clothes, boots, blankets, hats, ordnance, wagons, cars, boats, leather, soap, paper, medicines, are articles of such prime necessity, it is probable that the folly of sneering at mechanical skill will quickly become unfashionable. A barefooted F.F.V. or a sansculottic ""cavalier"" is in a poor plight to sneeze at your spinner of Lowell, or snub your shoemaker of Lynn. Indeed, we are not left without signs that a great change of temper in this regard is even now being brought about among the Southerners.
