A rebel regiment of infantry was observed in the morning drilling on a hill between the London and Hampshire Railroad. Artillery was also observed in that direction, and from the fact that they are throwing up fresh, earth works to the left of Falls Church, on an eminence a mile and a half distant, and commanding the village, it is inferred that they intend remaining in the neighborhood. About 6 o'clock in the morning they showed a battery of six pieces of artillery, supported by a few companies of artillery at Great Falls, opposite the position occupied by Gen. MCCALL's position. They threw a few cannon-shots across the river at our men, but without effect, when a detachment of troops was sent to the river by Gen. MCCALL to dispute the passage of the river should they attempt it. The rebel force was then increased by eight regiments of infantry, to which exhibition of strength Gen. MCCALL responded by ordering forward two guns and a column of infantry. This proved to be too much for the enemy, for they immediately dispersed -- some going up the river and some down.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/01/archives/cotton-for-england.html,,"The discussions with which the English Press teems in reference to the supply of cotton, to make up for the anticipated deficit in the receipts from America, will, we are afraid, quite destroy the reputation of that country for good sense or provident forecast. There certainly never was a more melancholy display of ignorance, imbecility and blind confidence, that all will be well in the future simply because it is desired. The work of generations is expected to be accomplished in a few short months. For thirty years past have English manufacturers been discussing the subject of production elsewhere than in the United States, and proclaiming the necessity of throwing off the bondage to this country which this article imposed, while each year only served to strengthen it. American cotton has come to be almost the only staple used in their mills. In the prospect of its loss they are casting about for a supply elsewhere, and are flattering themselves that it is to come from some source or other, entirely oblivious to the fact that the production can nowhere be increased except at a very slow rate, and that instead of one, two or three years being sufficient to make up for the American defect, neither five, ten, nor fifteen years would suffice. While so near the verge of the precipice that they could, if they would, hear the roar beneath, they appear to fancy that everything before them is plain sailing. But, after all, we do not know that this stolidity is any cause for astonishment. When did a people, situated as is the cotton-spinner, who never yet failed of a supply, even adequately appreciate, or provide for, the possibility of a change? An event that has never been experienced is never anticipated. It is no less certain, however, that one-sixth of the whole population of the United Kingdom will soon be out of work, and in a starving condition, unless the customary supply from America goes to them in due time. The consequence of such a disaster we will not pretend to describe, because imagination cannot picture them in all their magnitude and horrors. If they are averted, it will be through the power of the Government of the United States alone, by the capture and opening of the Southern ports. Unless this can be done, not a bale of American cotton will go to market. It would be a just retribution that England should suffer for the encouragement she has extended to the rebellion; but this, unfortunately, cannot fall upon the heads deserving it. It is the English ruling classes, not the English operatives, that have sought to make Secession a power, for the purpose, by breaking up our Government, of removing an unpleasant spectacle of civil liberty more perfect than their own, and of destroying a hated commercial rival. But this rival already controls that upon which the prosperity, if not the very existence, of a large portion of the population of England depend. This fact will soon be so palpable, that we should not he in the least degree surprised at overtures from that country to assist us in breaking down the rebellion by capturing Southern ports. It will soon be seen that this is the condition precedent to the receipt of the first bale, from this country. This new role, after all the ill-will and hostility displayed toward this country, would be a most mortifying come down, but it may be preferred to self-destruction. We do not need any assistance, but it might facilitate matters somewhat. It is probable that the English Government has already discovered its mistake in the encouragement it has given the rebellion, and heartily repents it, and more than all must it be most deeply mortified to feel that its people will owe their escape from material destruction to the very power which it assumed to be defunct, with very decided expressions of complacency over such a supposition.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cotton for England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cotton for England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/358d9f4e-6608-5adf-a217-c64c7b0fdd6a,659,nyt://article/358d9f4e-6608-5adf-a217-c64c7b0fdd6a,

"WINTER GARDEN. -- A very charming comedicita, called the ""Actress by Daylight,"" was produced here last evening, and brought the range of Mrs. JOHN WOOD's capabilities in a pleasing way before the public. It is nothing now, when even tradition is silent to impersonate so renowned an interpreter of the various emotions of the dramatic muse as Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, but it is surely something to give us two scenes so varied in their character that they scarcely seem to belong to one ""line of business."" In doing this, Mrs. WOOD reproduces in no unworthy way, one of the historical feats of the stage. In her day, Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE was the envy of the art world, the toast of prime ministers, and the glory of the stage. That she should live in literature is not remarkable. The incidents of her life have furnished the narrative and dramatic world with material for some of its most pleasant conceits. Not long since Mr. CHARLES READE constructed a little story called "" Art,"" in which the great actress, Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, was the principal character. It is from this that the author of the ""Actress by Daylight"" has drawn his inspiration. The same sort of thing has been told a hundred times before, but never so pleasantly. A foolish poetical lad falls in love with the great actress of the hour, Mrs. Bracegirdle. He writes a tragedy for her, and in many ways, less imbecile, proves that he is a devoted swain. She tries to dissuade him, and enacts a comedy scene for the purpose of disgusting him. Falling in this, at a later period she recites a portion of the young man's tragedy to his father, by which that gentleman is reconciled to a marriage with the actress. The denouement is of course happy. On slight materials like these a very delightful comedietta has been constructed. It possesses the double advantage of showing off Mrs. WOOD's best powers in comedy, and in introducing us to a very pleasant relish of her capabilities in a higher and more serious walk of art. We have seldom seen the lady to such advantage.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/01/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- A very charming comedicita, called the ""Actress by Daylight,"" was produced here last evening, and brought the range of Mrs. JOHN WOOD's capabilities in a pleasing way before the public.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/01/archives/what-may-have-befallen-the-great-east.html,,"ERN.--The Persia's account of the disaster to this vessel, is about as satisfactory as the traveler's account of the loss of his leg, to the Yan kee interlocutor ""It was bit off."" What carried away both paddle-wheels, the rudder-post and the boats? That this was due to size alone, is contrary to all this vessel's former experience in heavy weather. That the Great Eastern rolled excessively when the Persia spoke her, may be very satisfactorily accounted for by the loss of her paddle-wheels -- by the loss of two hundred tons of weight twenty-five feet above the water-line. It is well known that a ship loaded only at the bottom, or partly full of water, or deprived of the top weight of her masts, rolls as if she were going to capsize at each plunge. The Great Eastern had very little cargo or weight, above water, of course, to balance the enormous weight of her engines and boilers, in the bottom. A leak, filling one or two compartments near her keel would aggravate this already abnormal motion, (for the ship cannot be trimmed for heavy weather without a full cargo,) and might have caused motion enough to have sprung and broken the shafts, which had no outboard bearings. The loss of her wheels, however, is sufficient cause for excessive rolling, and does not at all condemn her dimensions as to seaworthiness. We can surmise no normal cause of the loss of the paddle-wheels except tins -- excessive racing of the wheels, to a degree never possible in smaller ships. The Great Eastern would span two waves whose crests might be four hundred to six hundred feet apart. With her bow on one and her stern on the other, it may be readily imagined that both paddle-wheels would be several feet, perhaps ten or fifteen feet, clear of the water, and so get up an excessive velocity, in default of proper regulating apparatus, properly applied and in first-rate order -- a state of things to be expected from the management of the Great Ship Company -- and so, when the rear wave let down her stern, and the forward wave rolled back, enveloping full half of both wheels in an instant, the sudden check to the motion might well have twisted the shafts off and let the wheels drop. This is the only reasonable theory in the absence of the facts -- if we ever get them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHAT MAY HAVE BEFALLEN THE GREAT EAST', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHAT MAY HAVE BEFALLEN THE GREAT EAST', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f79e2a01-1766-57c7-b99f-f20fac20b802,406,nyt://article/f79e2a01-1766-57c7-b99f-f20fac20b802,

"A large number of the members of this Club assembled last evening at its rooms in the Cooper Institute. Hon. TRUMAN SMITH, of Connecticut, being present, on invitation addressed the meeting. He spoke at length on the causes of the rebellion, arguing that there was and could be no good reason for it. The South, he said, has always had more of National power and patronage than the North, and it is the love and loss of these which has precipitated the Slave States into their present treason. Mr. SMITH proposes at a future time to address the Club on secession as a constitutional question. E.H. SPOONER. Esq., next addressed the Club. He rejoiced that after what had fallen from the lips of the eloquent and patriotic Senator who had preceded him, that it was unnecessary to discuss the question of the right or wrong of secessionism.

Hon. TRUMAN SMITH, of Connecticut, being present, on invitation addressed the meeting. He spoke at length on the causes of the rebellion, arguing that there was and could be no good reason for it. The South, he said, has always had more of National power and patronage than the North, and it is the love and loss of these which has precipitated the Slave States into their present treason. Mr. SMITH proposes at a future time to address the Club on secession as a constitutional question. E.H. SPOONER. Esq., next addressed the Club. He rejoiced that after what had fallen from the lips of the eloquent and patriotic Senator who had preceded him, that it was unnecessary to discuss the question of the right or wrong of secessionism.

The following in regard to the disaster to the steamship Great Eastern is taken from the English papers:  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/02/archives/the-disaster-to-the-great-eastern.html,,"The Great Eastern left her moorings in the River Mersey at 1 1/2 o'clock on Tuesday, the 10th of September. The pilot left her at 4 o'clock. Immediately putting on full speed, all went well with her until 4 o'clock on Thursday, when a strong breeze prevailing, the aft tackle of one of the forward boats on the port side became unhooked, leaving it suspended by one tackle. The Captain endeavored to steady the ship while this was rectified; but found, to his surprise, that the ship would not answer the helm. The fact was, though it was not known at the time, the rudder-pin was broken. The fore-staysail was run up, but the wind immediately split it into ribbons. The fore-trysail was then run up, but it was blown away. The paddle engines were now stopped, and the boats ordered to be cut away, when the Great Eastern once more started on her course. The passengers then went down to dinner, and from that moment commenced a chaos of breakages which lasted without intermission for three days. Everything breakable was destroyed. Furniture, fittings, services of plate, glasses, piano -- all were involved in one common fate. It now became known that the rudder was unmanageable. About 6 o'clock the vessel had to be stopped again, owing to two rolls of sheet lead, weighing some hundred weight each, which were in the engine-room, rolling about with every oscillation of the vessel with fearful force. These having been secured, another start was made, when a tremendous grinding was heard under the paddle-boxes, which had become twisted, and the floats were grinding against the side of the ship. The paddles were stopped, and thenceforward the scene is described as fearful in the extreme. The ship rolled to violently that the boats were washed away. The cabin, besides undergoing the dangers arising from the crashes and collisions which were constantly going on, had shipped, probably through the port-holes, a great deal of water, and the stores were floating about in utter confusion and ruin. Some of the chandeliers fell down with a crash. A large mirror was smashed into a thousand fragments; rails of bannisters, bars, and numerous other fittings were broken into numberless pieces.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DISASTER TO THE GREAT EASTERN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DISASTER TO THE GREAT EASTERN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ships and Shipping', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09d337f6-9b3d-5c10-9221-939953632321,1250,nyt://article/09d337f6-9b3d-5c10-9221-939953632321,

In the rear of the Ninth Ward Police Station, is a public place, partly inclosed, forming it into a lane, in which these stolen cattle are unlawfully pounded, apparently under the protection of the officials there. This is a crying nuisance to the neighborhood. One of the editors of the TIMES occupies a residence opening upon this lane, and a morning or two since, as his little daughter, aged about eight years, was returning from the grocer's with a loaf of bread, some half-dozen of those young thieves came rushing in upon he heels a herd of over 30 cows, in full trot. It was only by clambering up a fence in her frigid, and tumbling headlong into a lot in the rear of the Police Station, that she escaped being trodden to death by the dashing beasts.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/59bad9f4-6cf1-5190-a003-4a9e43c7ab29,684,nyt://article/59bad9f4-6cf1-5190-a003-4a9e43c7ab29,

"-- The man who makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, is a public benefactor. So says philosophy. The man who gives to us a thousand lives which would otherwise be laid in the grave, is a still greater public benefactor. So says common sense. And such a man, to our judgment, is the inventor of the ""Patent Rope Reel,"" which, as a fire engine, is conveyed to a conflagration, carefully gathers up whatever slack of the rope the inequalities of the ground and so on may occasion, and keeps it from tripping up and leading to a violent death any one who might accidentally step upon it. In descending a hill for distance, when an engine or hose carriage acquires an impetus that it is difficult to restrain, exceedingly cautious men often let go of the rope, especially when exhausted by a long run, lest their feet might catch in that portion of it which, slackened by the descent, drags upon the ground. To tread upon such is almost inevitable death, and to avoid treading on it is a feat of no small dexterity. Now, it is clear that if some simple apparatus were attached to the carriage on a run which would let out the rope when more was needed and promptly gather up the superfluity whenever it slacked, all danger would be avoided. But then it must be a self-operating apparatus, and one requiring no attention of the firemen at hand, who would have at that moment something else to think about. It must be something that would act instantly, effectively, and of itself. Just such an apparatus is the ""Patent Rope Reel"" in all respects, and firemen and others interested have now an opportunity to scrutinize its simplicity and effectiveness with case, since its inventors, Messrs.

Many of the members of the Fire Department have already examined it, and they express their satisfaction in no measured terms.

The increase of the white population for the ten years was 1,118,630, or a fraction over 20 per cent.

The increase, therefore, was 5,791,608, or about 37 1/2 per cent. -- nearly double that of the revolted States. It will be remembered that this increase of the loyal States is made up largely of emigration front Europe, consisting in the main of hardy, frugal, industrious people, who come to this country to better their fortunes, looking for freedom of individual labor, and a field for their enterprise, which lacked scope and verge at home; -- that they brought with them more or less of the precious metals, received for the sale of their little property in the old country, the which, with their productive industry, have added largely to the wealth and resources of this.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Wealth of the Country Evidence of the Census.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Wealth of the Country Evidence of the Census.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bf956041-cc0c-5748-998a-48c82c800488,1133,nyt://article/bf956041-cc0c-5748-998a-48c82c800488,

In March, 1857, the plaintiff removed from the apartments willed to her, and rented them; and in October, of the same year, the defendant, Ann Eliza Cohn, one of the executors of the will of Tobias, caused a fence to be run through the yard, thus giving each house a separate yard, and preventing the tenants of one house from using or occupying the yard of the other.

"A PHYSICIAN CHARGED WITH MURDERING A CHILD. Coroner JACKMAN yesterday held an inquest upon the body of an infant which was murdered on Tuesday evening, at the tenement-house No. 334 Greenwich-street, twelve hours after its birth. Its mother, a woman named MARY ANN BAKER, took apartments in the house about ten days since, and represented herself as the wife of a soldier who had gone to the war.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/04/archives/general-city-news.html,,"On Tuesday morning she wastaken sick, and one of the neighbors sent for Dr. PETTIJEAN to attend to her. He was present when the child was born, and the mother offered him money to destroy it. Of course, he refused, and when he left the house the infant was perfectly well. A few hours later a Dr. WILSON visited the woman and took the child from its nurse. He handled it roughly, according to the testimony of witnesses, squeezing its chest with his hands and applying tight bandages to its body. Some women who were present protested against the inhuman treatment, but the Doctor said it was all right -- that he had handled children that way before. As might have been expected, it was not long before the babe exhibited symptoms of suffocating, and it soon died, its body meanwhile changing from the natural color to a dark blue. The Doctor left before death ensued, promising to return, but he has not since been seen, although an effort' has been made to find him. Other circumstances were developed by the testimony, showing conclusively that the mother was ashamed to acknowledge the child, and before its birth had submitted to treatment at WILSON'S hands with a view of getting rid of it. The jury rendered a verdict of ""death from violence at the hands of Dr. WILSON, and we consider the mother, MARY ANN BAKER, an accessory before the fact."" It is probable that the name of WILSON was assumed by the accused. None of the witnesses knew anything about him, but Mrs. BAKER told the Coroner that his office was in Second-street. She is at present too ill to leave her bed, but the Police have her under surveillance.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3fd25819-1918-5acf-be7f-8765830ca3b5,708,nyt://article/3fd25819-1918-5acf-be7f-8765830ca3b5,

We cannot, of course, vouch for the truth of this report, but it is by no means an improbable one. It is well known that the Government has for sometime been purchasing and fitting out steamers for special service, and that a numerous body of sailors has been recruited -- and it is equally certain that these steamers and sailors have not been retained in the Northern ports. The comparatively defenceless position of New-Orleans, and its importance as a commercial port, have quite likely induced the Government to plan its capture, as the most effectual blow which could be struck against the rebels at the present time.

Bacon, the staple  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/05/archives/the-rebel-movement-upon-kentucky.html,,"Not one of the cotton States is self-sustaining in the matter of food. When the ordinary sources of supply are interrupted, prices, as a matter of course, advance. Bacon, the staple article of food for nine-tenths of their people, is now selling in all their leading towns at 600 per cent. advance over the average peace prices, or at thirty cents per pound instead of five. The supply from Kentucky, Missouri and the Free States of the West being cut off, starvation prices are already reached. Prices of many other necessaries have advanced, probably in similar ratio. Flour is at 100 per cent. advance. Such a state of things, which is quite bad enough for the permanent or local population, and renders the concentration and maintenance in one position of large bodies of troops impossible, is the real cause for the recent invasion of Kentucky by the rebels; those of a strategical character -- to oppose the march of our troops southward -- being a mere blind. The rebels knew very well in the outset that they could never sustain a war in the cotton States; hence the involving of the border or food-producing States was absolutely necessary to success. In none other could they feed their Armies, while if these could be held, they would constitute a barrier against Northern invasion. They were successful in Virginia, and consequently concentrated the great body of their troops there. This State must now be pretty well exhausted, so much so as to afford very poor Winter quarters for a large army. They encouraged their soldiery to believe that these quarters would be in the Northern cities of Baltimore. Philadelphia, and even New-York. Such expectations are now thoroughly dispelled. The Potomac marks the most northerly boundary of their power. An irresistible necessity, therefore, forces them into Kentucky. This must take the place of the rich cities that were to afford them good quarters and abundant spoil. Missouri has been occupied for a similar reason; but Missouri does not compare with Kentucky in the extent of its resources. The latter State is one of the richest in the Union in food, particularly in the abundance and excellent qualities of its beef. It has a genial climate, is easily accessible from the other States, and could not be better adapted to the necessities of the rebels. Its vast material wealth is most attractive to them, as in their estimation they have only to reach out their hands to make it their own. From necessity as well as principle, they have adopted as their motto, ""Base is the slave who pays!""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Movement upon Kentucky.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Movement upon Kentucky.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10cb4d4a-4c78-5d0b-b55e-240db176c851,758,nyt://article/10cb4d4a-4c78-5d0b-b55e-240db176c851,

They have become so accustomed to these performances that they rather like them, and pronounce the Herald dull on those rare occasions when it tells the truth. When, after the repulse at Big Bethel, the Herald announced that Gen. BUTLER had proceeded in person to the place, conquered it at sight, and taken a thousand prisoners, its readers did not believe it -- but they had an agreeable ""sensation"" for nearly a whole day, -- and this was precisely what they had bargained for. The Herald was the first to announce the death of JEFF. DAVIS, -- and nine of its readers out of ten were inclined to give it a service of plate for a lie at once so grateful and so well timed. The truth is the Herald lives and has its being by thus titilating the public curiosity, -- by inventing news to suit the public taste; and the prosperity of which, it boasts, shows the shrewdness of its calculation. Its theory is that people take a newspaper, not for instruction, but for the gratification of an appetite; -- and that the more it can stimulate their curiosity and excite their wonder, by whatever means, the more sure it is of readers.

There is a very common misunderstanding at the North about the Southern Winter. The rebel States are mainly within the tropics; and a tropical climate is assumed to be one of perpetual Summer, where magnolias bloom the year round; fruits are always awaiting the gatherer, and fields, not white with cotton or yellow with corn, are green with luxuriant grass. The popular idea is, in short, that King Frost, upon no provocation, and at no time, invades the territories of King Cotton. It is unnecessary to tell the traveler how far are such impressions from the truth. The Southern Winter, though shorter, and rarely as rigorous as that of the Middle States, nevertheless has its periods of severe cold, when ice may be found upon the streams and ponds, and snow on the ground. With the exception of Florida, none of the States is exempt from these frosty conditions. The inhabitants, of course, accustomed, five-sixths of the year, to a genial or torrid temperature, suffer from such visitations of cold much more sensitively than the Northerner, but the latter can expect neither comfort nor health in the absence of the same precautions which are demanded by the Winters of Pennsylvania.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Blankets for the Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Blankets for the Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7972f0cc-5205-566e-b327-dd607754fee9,474,nyt://article/7972f0cc-5205-566e-b327-dd607754fee9,

The case was then taken by President CASTILLAto the Superior Court of Lima, where it also went against the Government, and the accused were ordered by the court to be set at liberty. Upon this, CASTILLA made preparations to expel them from the country, but, on the 9th inst., could find no naval officer who would execute the order, several having plumply refused to have any hand in it, and the commander of the war-ship Guisse having thrown up his commission rather than comply. So, on the 10th, CASTILLA himself went to Callao, and superintended the embarkation of the prisoners, Don FELIPE RIVAS, Don NORBERTO ELESPURU and Don FREDERICO LABRANAGA being placed on board a small vessel called the Iquique, and ex-President ECHENIQUE on the war-steamer Ucayali. Ten miles out at sea the Ucayali placed ECHENIQUE on board the Iquique, where bound nobody knows, but it is supposed to Australia or to Russian America. The Captain of the Iquique gets $20,000 for the job, and $300 a month for four years to travel abroad, as he dare not return to Peru to meet the public indignation. CASTILLA has probably sent them so far that they cannot get back before the Presidential election. The newspapers, generally so silent at Presidential outrages, are furious at this last despotic act, and the people cry out against it with one voice.

Mother Old-school opens wide her arms to her repentant son: ""Welcome home, Benedictus qui verit!"" But Dr. PETERS stands fast, and says, ""I am not with either of you, nor against either. You are both right, and both wrong. We have none of us received the final revelation of medical truth. We must wait, and watch, and learn."" And so he offends both parties; and the battle rages with a fierceness and a venom strangely common in a liberal profession which is justly celebrated for the humanity and benevolence of its members.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Broad School in Medicine.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Broad School in Medicine.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Medicine and Health', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a961ff5-c32c-5915-8f25-a15ca836a98e,1003,nyt://article/4a961ff5-c32c-5915-8f25-a15ca836a98e,

In order to have the money for these objects promptly available, the Legislature provided that the amount might be borrowed from the Banks of the State. A committee was appointed to visit the Banks, apportion the loan among them according to capital, and learn whether they would advance it to the State. In every case, the Banks offered more than was required of them. Kentucky is therefore in excellent credit, as judged by the severest test -- the ability to borrow cash. The Kentucky Banks have an aggregate capital of about $12,000,000. They are in excellent condition, specie-paying, and strongly loyal. Kentucky will be the first State in the Union, apparently, to pay her part of the direct tax levied by Congress, though the Hon. JOHN C.

The development of the military power of the Empire engrosses the vast energies of the present, as it did those of the first NAPOLEON. Yet to put one in a hundred of his subjects into the field, or 375,000 men, thoroughly equipped for active operation, would tax his means, far exceeding those of any other ruler, to the utmost. His lists might show a much larger number of men subject to military duty, but men are a very different thing from an army. Without training they are a mob. Without the most complete provision for their mobilization, without equipage, they are incapable of action; and without the best of food, clothing and shelter they fall victims to diseases which destroy them without being brought into the presence of the enemy. We all know what a mighty effort it cost England to put 50,000 men into the Crimea. She could have sent 200,000 there had she chosen, but only to sacrifice them to the climate, for the want of food and shelter. No European Power having no greater population than the South could possibly put more than 50,000 or 75,000 troops, properly armed, trained, provisioned and clothed, into the field. The rebels cannot do even this. They do not possess the means, either in money or materials. They have no suitable manufactories of arms or clothing, nor are they capable of putting such in motion. Their peculiar institution enables them to send a large number of men upon marauding expeditions, which are so attractive to an unemployed and turbulent people, who clothe and arm themselves after their fashion; who are willing to forego pay for the sake of flogging the Yankees, or to commute for it with what they can steal; and who are contented, in the Summer season, with lying on the ground and with rations of bacon and hominy. Such men may be valuable for a guerilla warfare, but they are utterly incapable of contending in the open field with one-third of their number of well-appointed and well-trained troops. The Spaniards are a brave people, but WELLINGTON, in his Peninsular campaign, was never so well pleased as when they were too far off to take part in his battles. No reliance could he placed upon them, and their presence only served to embarrass his operations. Such troops may do very well when opposed to green lines, and in the outbreak of the rebellion were really formidable. But they are rapidly ceasing to be so. Admitting the rebels have 250,000 men with muskets in their hands, which is one-twentieth their whole population, and which is thrice the number in ratio to its population that such a nation as France could keep under arms, they cannot by any possibility form an efficient army of 100,000 men. The thing is impossible, because such an army is the creation of money -- dollars. They have not even commenced the construction of such an army as Gen. MCCLELLAN is forming, with everything that can contribute to health, to rapid movement, to comfortable quarters, and with an abundant supply of food, and the most approved engines of destruction. A nation that wishes to form an army of 100,000 men, complete in every part, must commence by counting down $100,000,000 in hard money. No shams will do, because substance can never come of shams. Men may skirmish for a time, but they will not fight unless they are paid; nor can a commissariat ever be made up by rapine and plunder, or from voluntary contributions. We should at once admit that we should be fast going to destruction, to trust in delusions that any expedients take the place of money. Take the case of the rebels in Missouri. We presume that there is not a military man or civilian in the country who does not believe that 15,000 veteran troops could drive PRICE and his whole crew headlong from the State, no matter how large his force. The larger the worse for him, from the difficulty of handling or feeding them by plunder, as he moves from place to place.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Contending Forces Their Relative Strength.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Contending Forces Their Relative Strength.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c25467d4-2dfd-578d-b0b9-c42bcc7534f7,1116,nyt://article/c25467d4-2dfd-578d-b0b9-c42bcc7534f7,

It is hoped that the response to this imitation will prove that the heart of the people is with the Army in its defence of our nationality. There is not a man, woman or child who cannot do something to testify of a loyal disposition. There are thousands who are not fit to enter the field who cannot offer pecuniary aid, who yet are influenced by as patriotic an impulse as those who are in arms. A little concert of action, and moderate contributions from those who have a superfluity, will afford to such an opportunity of serving their country as truly and as effectually as if they subjected themselves to the hardships and privations and dangers of the campaign. Zeal, and skill, and success in this field of duty as truly testify of patriotism as ardor and sagacity and victory on the field of baise.

Their impetuous natures, brutalized by the institution of Slavery, maddened by the ravings of higher-law Abolitionists, whom they are taught to hate as representative of the whole North, fired by the promise of rapine in the rich cities of the Free States, and blindly struggling for an independence -- that abused watchword at which all people instinctively fly to arms -- an independence pictured to the people as the wealth and luxury to be derived from cheap and universal slave labor, and grasped by the leaders as despotic power -- such natures, thus incensed, are ready to lay down all that they have, and all that they are on the altar of rebellion. Full well do they understand that failure will not permanently injure their condition -- that the commercial North will never suffer them to remain a bleckaded, invaded, thriftless province -- that allegiance restored, they will again take part in the Government, and prosper with it all the more for its being reformed and strong -- and so, if it comes to the worst, they have not ""everything to lose."" But they have been taught to believe that they have everything to gain, if successful. While fear of political extinction, then, does not deter them from desperate exertion, their blind, ignorant, insane hope of independent power and luxury, founded on Slavery, intensifies every struggle, neutralizes poverty, and pain, and self-denial, and calls out every whit of courage and strength, and substance of which they are masters. As a people, they do not wait to be drafted, or even recruited, but they make common cause with their leaders, and in many cases present themselves, singly, in squads and in companies, armed and equipped, and without the hope of any pay but victory and its fruits -- plunder and Slavery. In short, all these causes have kindled among them an enthusiasm which, for a time, is better than whole shoes, and uniforms, and improved arms, and numbers, and credit, and money.

The argument of that class who persuade themselves that the Great Republic is destroyed, because they wish it to be, is well put, in an article copied by us a few days ago, from the London Times. This, says that journal, is only the contest, as old as history, between the centripedal and centrifugal tendency, or aspirations of the race. The North, it tells us desire union; the South, independence. The South, legally, have the worst side of the argument; historically and naturally, the best. Numberless attempts have been made in Europe to establish an empire coextensive with its territory: but the result is, that this is divided into twenty nationalities. The same law, the Times tells us, is to prevail on this continent, and is to be developed in the issue of the present contest. Slavery has nothing to do with it; commercial ideas but little.

"It is frequently spoken of as something to surprise one that a physician and surgeon, in the midst of the most active professional employment, should find time to be a prolitic and profitable writer on the various topics that fill this journal. But there should be no surprise about it.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/07/archives/new-publications.html,,"It is frequently spoken of as something to surprise one that a physician and surgeon, in the midst of the most active professional employment, should find time to be a prolitic and profitable writer on the various topics that fill this journal. But there should be no surprise about it. It is a fact, that the more a man does, within natural bounds, the more he is capable of doing. The more practice a man has, the more skillful he becomes in his practice. The more he studies and writes about his profession, (it is Lord BACON who truly says that ""writing makes the perfect man,"") the more competent he becomes to deal dispatchfully and successfully with every new case brought under his consideration. Dr. DIXON has been known many years as one of our most successful operative surgeons, whose precision and skill in delicate and dangerous cases have given him a reputation not confined to the United States. He is also known as an entertaining and instructive writer on almost every subject touching the well-being of man's body and mind, resulting from, individual habits and the organization of society. It is because of the scope and deeply moving interest of these subjects that the Scalpel, published by Dr. DIXON, periodically, we may say fitfully, through a period of eleven years, has the thrilling interest of a novel, and often reminds one of the graphic pages from the Diary of a London Physician. Indeed, a well-known publisher of this City, seizing with true business tact on the example of that well known work, has already published a volume, beautifully illustrated by DARLEY, from the ample pages of Dr. DIXON's work, entitled Scenes in the Practice of a New-York Surgeon, which is held by some to more than rival that celebrated book. Be that, however, as the reader of both books may determine. We propose to speak of the Scalpel in its more comprehensive character -- that of a teacher of the laws of health. It is here that Dr. DIXON is peculiarly forcible, and takes high ground toward his profession.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-10-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68973166-8ae7-5e55-8b66-f2080613536d,2200,nyt://article/68973166-8ae7-5e55-8b66-f2080613536d,

"The plan of publication which Mr. PUTNAM has adopted in issuing his National Edition of Irving's works, places us in a position of peculiar and regularly recurring embarrassment. With  the first of each month a new volume comes as  punctually as the new moon.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/07/archives/miscellaneous.html,,"The plan of publication which Mr. PUTNAM has adopted in issuing his National Edition of Irving's works, places us in a position of peculiar and regularly recurring embarrassment. With the first of each month a new volume comes as punctually as the new moon. As a matter of course, the publisher expects that something shall be said in praise of his pets, without considering the difficulty of well-speaking when the vocabulary of praise is exhausted. It would be excessively stupid to be forever saying the same thing. After having a dozen times said that the paper is of the purest, the binding of the best, and that the whole is a wonderful achievement of American art, it is really very difficult to say anything more or to write anything new. To expatiate on the literary merits of the works would be to convict one's self of an immaturity difficult for the world at large to imagine, and painful in the extreme for the sensitive mind to acknowledge. Travelers on the Hudson now-a-days do not think it necessary to say much about the scenery to their companions on deck, nor do they, except in the case of a few misguided and inexperienced Englishmen, think it necessary to write long descriptive letters to their friends. Somewhat thus, in reading The Sketch Book or Bracebridge Hall, one gathers the beauties to his heart in silence and folds them there, confident that the world will know he has found treasures though he do not proclaim the fact aloud. To close the book with an enthusiastic emphasis, and nod and wink at all around in a rapture of delight, would be an act of self-stultification not to be permitted by judicious friends. Hereafter, beyond chronicling the advent of each volume, we shall say little further in praise of this National Edition, though we may here add, in addition to the truism that IRVING's works are something that no well-ordered library can be without, our own hearty conviction that for the edition now in course of publication every well-balanced and properly-posted shelf will particularly pine.

A partial solution is at last presented. Through a letter written from the flag-ship of the Atlantic Squadron by one of its officers, we gather that the retirement of Capt. STRINGHAM not entirely voluntary. It is represented as growing out of a trifling conflict of authority between the officer and the Navy Department. A transport, seriously damaged by a collision, had been sent to the Washington Navy-yard for repairs. It was at once returned to Fortress Monroe, with letters containing a reprimand addressed to the Commodore because of his having dispatched the vessel thither, instead of having the damages, which were serious, repaired at Newport's News, where, it is said, no facilities for such work exist.

"We must express some surprise at the very low estimate which Mr. CHASE appears to make of the [???] of his countrymen. To be sure, this is a concio ad populum, -- an address, not to patriotic capitalists, but to patriotic private citizens. But in America every man is a man of business, and even if he were not we should have thought that very few persons possessing $50 were of so low an intelligence as to be the victims of so gross a rhetorical artifice as that which is attempted to be practiced upon them. Mr. CHASE says all that can be said with truth, -- perhaps, all that can be said in favor of the loan. But we should have thought that there must be few persons, indeed, among the public that he addresses, who do not know that there is nothing so clear that something may not be said on the other side. Let us suppose, for instance, the appeal of the Secretary for the Treasury submitted to a knot of Southern politicians. Does Mr. CHASE suppose that they would have nothing to urge against it -- we do not mean on the questions of duty and patriotism, but on the smaller, though not unimportant question, of the reward proposed for the opportune exercise of these virtues? We could imagine persons, for instanse, perverse enough to urge that the interest of seven and three-tenths per cent. by no means covered the risk to be incurred: that the provision of a revenue by Congress for one year by no maeans guaranteed a provision of the same revenue for the next; and that the creation of a sinking fund by no means implied the appropriation of that fund to the reduction of the debt. We could imagine them venturing to question the confident anticipation that the war will terminate early next, Spring, and to anticipate new loans even if that should be the case, and much more, of course, if it should not. Some persons might be disposed to think that these new loans would require more patriotism in the lenders, and therefore secure a higher reward than the old ones, and that the value of the old ones would thus be inevitably depreciated. It might be suggested, also, that the same state of feeling in the West which has rendered it necessary to tax it on a different scale from the East may result in a refusal to pay sums borrowed in the cause in which the Western States believe themselves to have but a remote and secondary interest, and it may also be thought that we have not yet reached tire limit of secession, and that heavy pecuniary burdens may be found quite as strong a disintegrating force as the protective tariffs of the North or the domestic institution of the South. We will not advert to the possibility of another defeat, for that, of coarse, is a suggestion too monstrous to be entertained for a moment. We do not presume to say what force is to be given to these rival considerations, but we think that, if Mr. CHASE chose to address his countrymen at all, he ought not to have confined himself so exclusively so his own side of the question, but ought also to have given some proof that he was capable of embracing the opposite point of view. It the interest offered is sufficient, the appeal to patriotism and the argument as to the safety of the investment are unnecessary. If it is insufficient, the remedy would have been to increase the amount, instead of appealing to considerations which, rightly viewed, amount to little more than a confession of weakness. People will be more ready to believe that a sufficient provision will be made for the payment and interest of the war loans of the Federal Government, when they see that provision has been made for bearing one farthing of the expense out of the income of the year. When this is not done, it seems not unnatural to conclude that those who are anxious during the heat and excitement of the contest to throw the whole burden on posterity, will become impatient of that burden when the heat and the contest have passed away.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/08/archives/the-financial-skill-of-mr-chase-his-appeal-to-the-people.html,,"We must express some surprise at the very low estimate which Mr. CHASE appears to make of the [???] of his countrymen.

Indeed, if the reports which reach us are based on truth, the rebel leaders have their hands full in keeping in subjection their dissatisfied troops. A resident of Falls Church who visited Washington yesterday, states that there was a revolt among the men recently -- that one regiment refused to do duty, and that four regiments sent to reduce the first one to subjection also revolted. The recent general withdrawal of the rebel lines may perhaps be thus in part accounted for.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e3ae6dc-05f0-5315-a9ab-4b718ab29198,1461,nyt://article/7e3ae6dc-05f0-5315-a9ab-4b718ab29198,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/08/archives/european-intervention-in-mexico-the-movements-of-spain.html,,"England and France are both largely interested in the welfare of Mexico. There are debts to be paid, there are lives to be saved. ""England has a larger amount of capital employed in Mexico than France, but the subjects of the French Empire there are more numerous."" Nor are Spain and the United States uninterested. The lives and properties of their subjects are also in imminent peril day by day. England has a right to enter and seize the custom-house, and appropriate the revenues for the payment of debt. No one can question for one moment the right of intervention. No one can doubt that the subject has occupied the anxious attention of France and England, of Spain, and even of the Government of the United States. But it is easier to note the peril than to devise the remedy. Lntervention is easy. No large force would be required to bring the country to its sense. But no Government would enter on such a course without ample deliberation and a careful forecast of the consequences. It is impossible to doubt that England and France alone, with a small force, could walk into the City of Mexico whenever they pleased; but, if needed, Spain could supply all the cavalry that such an expedition would require. There would be no difficulties in doing the business thoroughly, go far as the mere occupation of the country and capital were concerned. The difficulties would arise afterwards. They are great, but not insuperable. Any intervention of the kind we have indicated, whenever resolved on, whenever excuted, could not fail to succeed as a mere measure of military police, called for by the outrages on common humanity in Mexico. That such an intervention is extremely probable, and indeed only a question of time, is what all feel who have considered the subject. But it is clearly one that cannot be undertaken without very careful preparation, without clearly defined objects, and a due subordination of the means to the end. All the parties concerned are interested in obtaining is a recognition and liquidation of money obligations, guarantees for the security of life and property, and the exemplary punishment of those who have committed atrocious crimes on the persons of Europeans. The question is how can these objects be accomplished with the least loss of life and at the least cost? That an attempt must be made, sooner or later, to accomplish them, we are not able to doubt, althought it is not so easy to see the precise means which may be adopted for reaching the ends in view.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/08/archives/the-great-eastern-new-facts-about-ocean-steamships.html,,"We have at length, in the graphic narrative from our Correspondent, published in yesterday's TIMES, a full and reliable account of the mishap encountered by the Great Eastern. His letter shows that the ship was sent to sea in the most wretched trim and disorder every moveable in her being free to thrash and tumble about at every roll. But it also shows that as to strength of hull and engines the Great Ship was all that could be desired -- and this is a point of the highest importance, for weakness was the chief trouble apprehended. But ships must not only hold together and keep afloat; they must be guided with ease and celerity by apparatus of unfailing strength and durability. In this respect the Great Eastern failed, for it appears that she would come out of the trough of the sea before her rudder broke. Now it may have been that her helm could not be moved far enough -- we know that her steering geer was always troublesome -- or that the official investigation will show a mere accidental, not a radical defect. Let us suppose the worst, however -- that she could not be steered at all in a heavy sea. It would be idle to say that she had not headway enough, on account of the loss of her paddles; ships must be steered at a much less speed than nine knots, or they are failures. How is this grand defect to be certainly remedied? Mr. EDWIN STEVENS built a vessel, some years since, which, having a maximum speed of only eight miles, was turned end for end in one minute and a half, repeatedly, without using the rudder, or making any headway whatever. She had two screws; one was backed, the other driven forward. Various steamboats and sea-vessels, having disconnected paddle-wheels, have been spun round on their own centres, entirely irrespective of the steering apparatus. To say that the Great Eastern would not have done the same thing, similarly arranged, is to say that she could not move at all, for it is a simple question of power, and there was power enough in her to lift her into the air bodily, at the rate of a fathom a minute. Nor is there any reason to doubt that moving one of her paddle-wheels forward and backing the other, would have brought her out of the trough of the sea, or that disconnecting one and driving the other would have done it. Mr. SCOTT RUSSELL's original plan was to put in this disconnecting apparatus. But there were no paddles at all -- they had been carried away. True, but must all ships have weak paddles because the Great Eastern had them? Her wheels had no out-board bearing; the arms started from a short hub and ran diagonally, or ""dishing,"" in the worst possible shape for lateral strength. It would be the easiest thing in the world to make stronger paddle-wheels and to disconnect them so as to spin the ship around without any rudder.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Eastern New Facts about Ocean Steamships.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Eastern New Facts about Ocean Steamships.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dcf9c769-979d-5f82-baa5-56c79287cb07,1538,nyt://article/dcf9c769-979d-5f82-baa5-56c79287cb07,

It was a present from ladies in New-York, and was embroidered by Madame FRANCISCA KLEIN. Col. KOZLAY was also the recipient of a sword, with gold mountings.

It entitled to them to upset Government: or rather conspire for its destruction; and steal, rob and murder with impunity. Should other nations disprove or interfere, all the rebels had to do, as they supposed, was to threaten to withhold the staple, to bring the remonstrants upon their knees in abject submission. The grand text -- experimentum crucis -- has been applied. Cotton has been withheld, and the world, apparently, had manhood enough not to make the sacrifice demanded, and seeks to supply itself, as best it can, from other sources, and forego the use of what these furnish. But as if not to tempt selfishness or cupidity too far, Providence, at this juncture, gave to the North the prerogative of the supply of food, if the South had that of clothing. It is now proved that the two great nations of Europe, from whom any interference was anticipated from the blockade of cotton, are lamentably short in their grain crops; that of England lacking 64,000, bushels, and that of France 80,000,000 of an adequate supply, making the almost fabulous amount of 144,000,000 of bushels, which must be furnished by other lands. The evidence of this deficit, as well as our means of supply, are well stated in our commercial columns. If the amount of the deficit is only proximately ascertained, enough is known to show that the two countries will need the surplus of the world to save them from hunger.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Two Guarantees for Peace Food and Clothing.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Two Guarantees for Peace Food and Clothing.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0b89918-5fb7-559f-af1a-23d85cf49dc3,1315,nyt://article/f0b89918-5fb7-559f-af1a-23d85cf49dc3,

In August, 1860, Mr. Tracy and his family were traveling on the road from Troy to Golden Bridge, in this State. Upon arriving at Albany, his baggage, four trunks, were marked for Golden Bridge, the plaintiff purchasing through tickets to New-York. The plaintiff testifies that the baggage-master told him that the trunks were marked all right for Golden Bridge; but that when he got to Golden Bridge the conductor refused to deliver his baggage without he, plaintiff, would pay a dollar for a hold-over ticket; that the conductor said if he would pay him a dollar he should have a hold-over ticket and one trunk; if he would pay $2 he might have all the trunks. The plaintiff refused, and the train moved on, the conductor saying the baggage must go to New-York. Mr. Tracy and his daughters were deprived of their baggage thirty hours before the trunks could be obtained. This suit was thereupon brought to recover damages for the zeizure and detention of the baggage.

"The assurance, in spite of the denial of the Patrie, that the British Government, in conjunction with France and Spain, and with the consent of the United States, has resolved upon an intervention in Mexico, will cause neither surprise nor dissatisfaction.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/12/archives/details-of-the-arrangement.html,,"The assurance, in spite of the denial of the Patrie, that the British Government, in conjunction with France and Spain, and with the consent of the United States, has resolved upon an intervention in Mexico, will cause neither surprise nor dissatisfaction. The wonder has been that powerful nations should have been content to forego the usual rights conceded them by public law, and to leave their citizens to be robbed and murdered with impunity by the savages and fanatics of a decaying Republic. The misdeeds of the Mexican Government, or rather of the succession of factions which have borne that name, are so many that any recapitulation of grievances would be idle. The last fifteen years have been passed by foreign settlers and merchants in a state of constant uneasiness, and of late neither life nor property has been safe. We have, on more than one occasion commented on the extraordinary news which has reached us from that distracted country, and it may be said that, for the last year or two, the scandals made known by the arrival of each succeeding mail have surpassed those that had gone before. To dishonesty, to repudiation, to the legal and irremediable plunder of our countrymen by the default of a bankrupt community, we were steeled by long endurance. We were used to corrupt judges, trafficking and jobbing officials, insolent underlings, and all the hateful creatures which are generated by the rottenness of a State. Nor were we likely to be moved by ordinary crimes. Half-caste vagabonds might waylay travelers or murder respectable citizens within a few miles of the capital, and as long as it was possible to hold the Government free from responsibility, and to suppose that these were only private malefactors, England would have acted on the maximum that he who lives abroad takes the country of his residence as he finds it, and cannot appeal to his own sovereign for protection against ordinary injuries. But the time has come when forbearance will be no longer possible. It is plain law and good sense that when the injuries done to a foreign settler are owing to the act or neglect of the Government of the country where he lives, his own sovereign has a right to call upon the offending State for redress. Now, in this case, the outrages committed are, beyond a doubt, the result of the violence of political parties in Mexico and the complete anarchy into which the Republic has fallen. British subjects have been plundered not only by the rufhans to whom the evil times have given impunity, but by the chiefs of the contending factions, and even by men who have called themselves the rulers, and who have been, for the time, the rulers of the country. It would be satisfactory to be able to say that these excesses have been committed by the party which is most opposed to liberal principles, and which is constituted chiefly by the numberless priests of the country, leading the most ignorant and savage of the Mexican race. But, though undoubtedly the party if Juarez is far less guilty than its opponents, and though at the present time it is the ecclesiastical guerillas and bandits who are chiefly the terror of the foreign residents, yet no party in Mexico is free from blame, nor can any justly complain that the Republic is threatened by foreign Powers for what is the fault of a faction only.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DETAILS OF THE ARRANGEMENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DETAILS OF THE ARRANGEMENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c824d3b-c9c2-5c88-a8fd-d3be90cc391a,1614,nyt://article/6c824d3b-c9c2-5c88-a8fd-d3be90cc391a,

The ""Christian Martyr,"" an engraving just issued in Paris from one of DELAROCHE's pictures, has made its appearance here simultaneously.

"This task, in the hands of the maritime nations which are about to undertake it, is obviously rendered an easy one by the extent of the seaboard of Mexico and the relative important of its commerce. Wehave only to occupy the entrance to the principal ports, and we hold our hands upon the channel through which all the revenues of the country must flow. Following the course approved of by the Mexican Government itself when it hypothecated part of its custom duties for the payment of the interest due to foreign bondholders, it is proposed that the Consuls of the three Powers at the ports which we think proper to seize shall receive the customs dues, half of which they will pay over to the Mexican authorities, retaining the other half in satisfaction of the claims of their respective Governments.

To answer this question is the object of his letter to Mr. CHADWICK, and he does it in a very able manner, showing what the Union really is, and what are the limits of State rights, and completely demolishing the arguments of the Secessionists. As regards such States as Texas and Florida, it is shown that the effect of annulling the ordinances by which they were erected, is simply to restore them to the condition of territories, to be governed by Congress.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/14/archives/the-decline-of-the-rebellion.html,,"The Southern newspapers just now confine editorial discussion to the difficult point where shall the rebel army pass the Winter? One recommends Missouri, another Kentucky and Kanawha, another Maryland, while the Richmond journals, vicing with each other through long habit in unreason and audacity, select Ohio and Pennsylvania as the more eligible seats. In all this there is nothing either positive, or practical, or practicable. What is positive and to the purpose is, that they fully recognize the impracticability of the army remaining where it is; and also the impossibility of retiring to the Southern States, followed into the heart of the slave-inhabited and cotton-growing region by the National forces. For, it is never to be forgotton that the mass of the Southern people are kept to the work only by the perpetuation and invention of delusions. One engagement made by their leaders through the Press no sooner fails than another takes its place, to be replaced in turn by others equally dazzling. Last Spring the rebels were led to expect certain victory at every step of their northward advance. Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New-York, Boston, were to be but milestones in a journey of a Summer's day; and Winter, when it came, was to find them sheltered and quite comfortable in Fifth-avenue mansions, or in the shadow of Bunker Hill. To have suggested a possibility that frost might overtake their armies just where Spring left them, in the shelter of their tents, imperfectly clothed, and at a distance from supplies of food and fuel, would quite certainly have brought upon the doubter fatal suspicions of his fidelity to the cause of treason. This illusion has been dispelled, and another succeeds it. It is manifestly out of the question to maintain the army all Winter at Manassas. It will never do to present too suddenly the spectacle of retreat to a people already much suffering, much deceived, and much complaining. To promise the recovery of the doubtful Border States, or to tell confidently of Winter quarters in Pennsylvania or Ohio, is an intermediate deception, which shall prepare the way for the mortifying disappointment that must very shortly visit the entire Southern population. What could not be done in the Spring, when the North was at every disadvantage, and the South in the possession of numbers and means it can never in the most favorable circumstances repeat certainly cannot be hoped for in the Autumn, when all the conditions of the contest incline to the side of the loyal States. Aggressions they dared not attempt then, in the presence of an inferior force imperfectly armed and provided, they will not attempt now against armies of superior strength, amply armed with all the inventions of modern scientific warfare, and supplied from the abounding granaries of a country ready to feed the world. Against such resources it is impossible to maintain a show of resistance. The rebel Generals have not ventured to tell the people of Richmond that the abandonment of Virginia is a foregone conclusion; that it remains with the National leaders to fix the time when the rebels shall evacuate the Commonwealth; but they are ascertainly aware that the fact is so as that they possess the most elementary knowledge of the art of war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Decline of the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Decline of the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/02568ed7-ab34-5a0e-ba82-0f2ed3658911,998,nyt://article/02568ed7-ab34-5a0e-ba82-0f2ed3658911,

At the application of this touchstone reputations shrivel, and giants dwindle down into dwarfs. The world daily demands something new of its idols. A sustained flight will not at all satisfy the popular craving. Higher altitudes must be reached, or condemnation swiftly follows the voice of praise. Among the foolish many there are a wise few who fully comprehend this peculiarity of an impulsive public. These few wisely husband their resources; they ""let themselves out"" by degrees, and always contrive to keep an extra force in reserve to meet this inevitable demand. Several eminent wits have kept their choicest bon mots for their death-beds. Congressmen not infrequently adopt this rule, and, after sputtering through a session like imperfect candles, go out in ablaze of glory. HERRMANN understands this true secret of successfully. His pachydactylous rival, the hippopotamus, didn't, and here HERRMANN has proved himself the greater of the two. The hippopotamus had the advantage in point of size -- HERRMANN has in sagacity. The former opened his mouth unguardedly and unreservedly, showing all his wonders at once. The consequence was that we soon tired of him, and answered his benevolent and smiling attempts to please by responsive yawns. Had he at first but opened his mouth by inches, he could have given the public an ell when they demanded it. He might have managed his countenance on the principle of a climax, rising by degrees to finish by castanetting the outer surfaces of his jaws together behind his tufted tail, to the confusion of his Nubian keeper. Or he might have doubled his aesophagus up in compartments, and only exhibited quarter sections at a time.

Taking the eight months ended on the same day of the two years, the difference is much less, showing that the irregularity of trade has been increasing as the year has rolled on. The shipping arrived at British ports from the United States amounted, during the larger period, to 1,592,459 tons, against, 1,217,951 tons in the first eight months of last year; whilst the shipping cleared for American ports was only 918,617 tons, against 1,033,951 tons. The details of the trade accounts correspond with those of the shipping Britain imported, during these eight months, 1,790,212 qrs. of wheat, and 3,678,484 cwts. of flour, the produce of the United States, against 387,367 qrs. of wheat, and 887,479 cwts. of flour in the corresponding period of last year.

There was an equal falling off in the imports from Brazil and Egypt, but the receipts from India show a considerable increase. The August account shows an increase from all parts except the United States, the supply from which diminished from 669,274 cwts. to 448,061 cwts., as compared with last year. The imports of Indian cotton, on the contrary, were double the average monthly receipts of the year, and nearly three times as much as was imported in the corresponding months of 1860. The enhanced value of the article is shown by the fact that, though the imports of American cotton declined in quantity, the value is computed at ¤23,989,450 for the eight months, against ¤23,579,504 last year.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Trade With England.; EFFECTS OF THE WAR UPON ENGLISH EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Trade With England.; EFFECTS OF THE WAR UPON ENGLISH EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e26fbd5-269e-5c55-8457-985996eb5c42,781,nyt://article/5e26fbd5-269e-5c55-8457-985996eb5c42,

The female prisoner is said to be one of the most expert thieves in the country. She was released from State Prison only a few weeks since, having been sentenced there for a period of five years upon conviction of grand larceny in stealing silks from STEWART's, in Broadway. Soon after entering the prison she succeeded in convincing the agent of the Prison Association, Mr. BEALE, that she was innocent, and by his advice and that of other respectable gentlemen Gov. MORGAN granted her a pardon. Since her discharge she has been constantly with her old companions, and engaged in her old practices. Upon searching her rooms yesterday, a large quantity of silks, muslins, cigars and other goods were found, believed to have been stolen. The articles recovered are at the Tenth Precinct Station-house, where they may be seen by parties interested. Justice CONNOLLY committed them all to the Tombs to await the action of the Grand Jury. An attempt was made to bribe the officers and let the accused go free, but without success.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6f3f5324-ef0b-5f49-9171-0f5d76b3d9b0,911,nyt://article/6f3f5324-ef0b-5f49-9171-0f5d76b3d9b0,

Letters have softened the hatred and quenched the wrath of rival communities, and inspired the gentle spirit of humanity and civilization to peoples, yet half barbarous, in their mutual envies and jealousies. Scholars have usually felt the responsibility of their position; that, in some respects, they were to be the leaders of human progress, and were to show a broad sympathy with man and a kindly feeling, which should rise far above the passions of the time. Even when fired with patriotism, they have related the brave achievements of their countrymen, in some struggle with foreign injustice or oppression, in words which posterity should record: they have felt it to be one of the bounden courtesies of their class to chronicle fairly the brave deeds of the enemy and to do manly justice to him.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The London Saturday Review.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The London Saturday Review.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8bdab826-6de2-53e0-af5b-c4157dc791c7,1188,nyt://article/8bdab826-6de2-53e0-af5b-c4157dc791c7,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/14/archives/cotton-operators-and-the-coming-winter.html,,"Hard times are in store for the laboring people of England. All the assurances of her orators and journalists as to the attainability of an adequate supply of cotton, cannot allay the apprehensions of her manufacturers. In vain the capacity of India and Egypt is dwelt on; in vain associations are formed to stimulate the production of the precious staple; in vain the Government promises to facilitate its importation by every means in its power; despite of all, the panic spreads, and already its effects are becoming visible. The malady first showed itself in Manchester, the capital of cottondom. There, a few weeks since, a circular from one of the leading firms gave notice to the people that ""short-time"" was probable and economy necessary. This was only a politic mode of communicating unwelcome intelligence to the masses, and was merely a prelude to the still more disheartening notices that subsequently appeared, announcing the actual adoption of ""short-time"" by such and such mill-owners. From Manchester the epidemic has extended to Bolton, Rochdale and Blackburn. In Bolton one very large firm, having six mills, and which employed, last Summer, 787 hands, has closed altogether, and warned its discharged operatives to seek work elsewhere, as there was no likelihood of business being resumed. In Rochdale eight firms are working only four days a week, and one has stopped in toto. While in Blackburn and its vicinity, no less than twelve firms, some of them owning several mills, are now working only four days weekly, and consider even four days too many, in the present state of trade. In a word, there are thousands of people in England already either wholly or partially out of employment, in consequence of the cotton panic, and tens of thousands more will be in the same deplorable situation, from the same cause, before the Winter sets in. Yet, strange to say, while such is the condition of the manufacturing districts, cargoes of cotton are shipped from Liverpool to America -- a phenomenon which can only be paralleled by the incessant exportation of provisions from Ireland throughout the period of the famine!",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cotton Operators and the Coming Winter.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cotton Operators and the Coming Winter.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cotton', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b7b8b11c-5616-5498-ab79-023bef34ac5e,516,nyt://article/b7b8b11c-5616-5498-ab79-023bef34ac5e,

The City of New-York gains by a very much larger ratio -- the valuation in 1860 being $550,078,788, and in 1861 rising to $571,078,798 -- a gain of $21,000,000. In fact, the additional valuation may be said to fall bodily upon the City -- a circumstance which proves, if nothing else, what unlimited confidence is reposed in the power of our people, even at this moment of supreme effort and endurance, to accept the burdens of necessary taxation.

Indeed, if common report does not mistake, his horror of the stool of repentance passes ordinary bounds. Of late, however, and especially since the more appreciative spirit manifested by Russia, he has been tormented by an uneasy suspicion that there are some points in his late relations to us which it were well to make a clean breast of. Indeed, it must be confessed that, if the policy of England towards this country had been controlled during the last few months by some subtle enemy, it could scarcely have been more injurious to her true interests. On this point, the ablest British statesmen seem to be gradually making their way to the conviction which long ago was patent to the rest of the world. The decline in the funds, the rumored dissensions in the Cabinet, the altered tone of the leaders of parties, the delay of the troops ordered to Canada, the modification of the Mexican programme, the official avoidance of giving umbrage to our Government, and the late assurances that the rebel States shall receive no immediate countenance or sanction, combine with other circumstances, to indicate a new phase of public opinion; while in spite of the absurd rhodomontades of the London Times, Economist and Saturday Review, it cannot be doubted that the apprehensions of a cotton famine, and the appalling terrors it would let loose on one-sixth of the population of England, and through them on the whole Kingdom, render it not improbable that, except a more acceptable policy be adopted, the Palmerston Cabinet may be ere long swept away by the swelling tide of popular feeling relative to American affairs. For it is beginning to be better understood by the British people, whatever their rulers may have wished or believed, that cotton can be had. if at all, only through the good office of our National Government; and time it is the interest off all who need cotton to give the whole moral force of their sanction and support to the suppression of rebellion and the corroboration of the Union.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England Veering Round.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England Veering Round.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e848d315-b1ec-5e52-8fb5-a46093ea0fc2,1747,nyt://article/e848d315-b1ec-5e52-8fb5-a46093ea0fc2,

Capt. FRANCIS GRIMM testified that deceased was a member of his company, connected with the Sixth Regiment, quartered at present in Elm Park, at Eighty-ninth-street; that he gave him a furlough on Monday last, which permitted him to be absent from 9 to 12 o'clock; that about 2 P.M., on Monday, he first heard of his death; that deceased was a sober, steady man, about 23 years of age, and had recently joined the regiment, having come here from Iowa. RANSOM R. GRAVES, the engineer in charge of the train, testified that as he was running the down train from Sing Sing, which was due in New-York at 12.40 P.M. on Monday, when nearing Ninety-sixth-street, he saw something on the track, but at first supposed it was a bundle; as he approached nearer, saw it was a man, but thought it was a workman sighting the track; he was apparently stooping down looking for something; when he got nearer to him, saw that he was directly on the ground; upon noticing his face more particularly thought it had a blue appearance, and supposed then that he was dead; he stopped the train, backed up and took the body on the platform to Thirty-first-street Depot. CALEB WARD testified that he was a brakeman on the train, and that, nine or ten rods above Ninety-sixth-street, where the accident happened, he noticed that the brakes were applied, and soon after passing the body the train stopped; did not notice whether the body was warm or cold. Dr. WOOSTER BEACH made an examination of the body, and testified that the bones of the back part of the skull and the left arm in several places were badly fractured; that the shoulders were crushed, and that there were other injuries on the legs, arms and left side. He further testified: ""The injuries, in my opinion, were produced by a blow from a locomotive, and were the cause of death."" The verdict was, that deceased came to his death by causes unknown to the Jury.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6716062b-2762-5709-a76f-ea3eb17d9c1c,1008,nyt://article/6716062b-2762-5709-a76f-ea3eb17d9c1c,

Her greatest progress has been made during the times of greatest prosperity in the Northern States, and desolation there will make depression and embarrassment here. If the North succeeds, we may look for a speedy end to the war, and the return or prosperity. If it fails, we must expect a long contest at present, and perpetual trouble in the future. If the North is deprived of the South, and the bitter feeling which the Ministerial Press is trying, to excite between Canada and the States continues, the Reciprocity Treaty will be abolished. It was the South that gave us reciprocity to serve its own ends, and without its aid in Congress it will be almost hopeless to attempt to save the treaty. It seems to us that some members of the Government and the Editor of the Leader, annexationists of an extreme kind, are working to bring about the abrogation of the treaty, hoping that annexation may follow. We can imagine nothing more unwise, coming from any friend of British connexion than abuse of the Northern States and expressions of sympathy for the South. We have no connection with the Slave States, and can have none. All our trade is with the North. Interest as well as duty prompt us to sympathize with its cause. We are ready to make sacrifices for a worthy object. The dangers of war ought not to be regarded if it principle is at stake. But when we are asked to take sides with JEFF. DAVIS and his manhunting, [???] associates, and to denounce those with whom we are in daily and friendly intercourse, and who are engaged in fighting for a good cause, it is a little too much.

And in modern times, nations, far from the highest in the scale of refinement, have been distinguished for a delicate regard to the feelings of prisoners taken in battle. When our own gallant Gen BOYD, who, after the American war, served in the English army in the East Indies, had the misfortuno to be taken prisoner there, he was the object of the most polite attentions from those into whose hands he had been thrown by the fortunes of war. As he moved along with his captors, they endeavored to keep out of sight as much as possible the fact that he was under restraint. When the native commander came to a convenient camping ground for the night, he invariably sent a messenger to Gen. Born to ask If it would be his pleasure that the army should halt. And in the morning, when they were ready to march, the same messenger presented himself at his tent, to ask if it was his pleasure that the army should move, Doubtless this was an exaggerated form of politeness,' but it was an exaggeration in the right direction.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Who are the Elite of New-Orleans?; To the Editor of the New-York Times:', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Who are the Elite of New-Orleans?; To the Editor of the New-York Times:', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f60e7188-a3b2-5464-8fab-884fd5f16399,511,nyt://article/f60e7188-a3b2-5464-8fab-884fd5f16399,

Their base of operations in this case is behind the Rappahannock, while above that river they have only scattered pickets, scouts and foraging parties. In proof of the correctness of this supposition, the fact is known that, on Sunday last, there were not more than six regiments at Leesburgh, unincumbered with baggage; and positive information has been received that, on Tuesday last, a brigade which has been at Sangster's Station, on the Manassas and Alexandria Railroad, ever since the battle of Bull Run, had commenced to retreat, and had already proceeded as far as Union Mills, the other side of the late battle-field.

"At this period of the year the critic usually performs his most pleasing task. It is in ordinary times permitted to him to record the opening of the operatic campaign, and to anticipate with no unreasonable avidity the promised banquet of the management.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/18/archives/academy-of-music.html,,"At this period of the year the critic usually performs his most pleasing task. It is in ordinary times permitted to him to record the opening of the operatic campaign, and to anticipate with no unreasonable avidity the promised banquet of the management. He can talk of the operas that are to be produced -- of the singers who will make their appearance -- of the rows which will inevitably occur -- and of all the other little matters which contribute so agreeably to a fashionable excitement. We were in danger of missing this accustomed treat. The public complained of its impecuniosity, and the manager rather triumphantly declared that he was without funds. If that manager were any other than Mr. ULLMAN, the chances are that the halls of our musical temple would remain silent and deserted until more prosperous times blessed the land. But as the ablest Generals are those who distinguish themselves most in adversity, so is if with the managerial resources of Mr. ULLMAN. Precisely at the moment when he seems to be most crushed, he is in fact in the liveliest state of recuperation, Thus, although there seems to be no hope of a regular early Winter season, he has contrived to fire off a big operatic gun, for the purpose, it would seem, of letting us know that he is at the post of danger, and ready for hostilities when the right time comes. The event has been managed with so much dexterity, that every one feels warmed and cheered by its significance. Of the hundreds who were present last evening, there was probably not one who did not feel that he was assisting a courageous man in a good cause. Where the right sentiment is awakened a small amount of material assistance will carry a great undertaking to a successful issue. After witnessing the enthusiasm of last evening, we do not doubt that Mr. ULLMAN will succeed in organizing an operatic troupe, and perfecting, a little later than usual, perhaps, a creditable season. When art is in danger, as it always is in periods of strife and commercial depression, it is certainly gratifying to witness a response so prompt and hearty as that which has in this instance greeted a manager's appeal.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Academy of Music.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Academy of Music.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b00b227b-c6c7-511d-9661-da28089d63a6,862,nyt://article/b00b227b-c6c7-511d-9661-da28089d63a6,

"The Ordnance Department and the public are very anxious to test the RODMAN 15-inch gun by actual experiment. It is not doubted that the Union gun and the FLOYD gun, at Fortress Monroe, will smash in the sides of any ship or battery that the rebels may have loaded down with armor up to the limits of flotation. Here is a fact for them: Upward of five years ago, the Mersey Steel & Iron Company fired a 282 lb. shot with 25 lbs. of powder, at 120 yards range, from their 13-inch gun, at a plate made for one of the English iron-clad ships, by the Messrs. HORSFALL. The plate was 3 feet 9 inches, by 2 feet 9 inches, by 4 3/8 inches thick, and weighed 17 cwt. The plate was placed against the ends of nine bulks of timber, 6 feet long by 14 inches square, secured together by cross-plank, and bedded in sand. The ball struck the plate a little to the left of the centre, and drove the portion against which it struck, a distance of 300 yards, shattering the whole plate, and driving the timbers to some distance.

It is not doubted that the Union gun and the FLOYD gun, at Fortress Monroe, will smash in the sides of any ship or battery that the rebels may have loaded down with armor up to the limits of flotation. Here is a fact for them: Upward of five years ago, the Mersey Steel & Iron Company fired a 282 lb. shot with 25 lbs. of powder, at 120 yards range, from their 13-inch gun, at a plate made for one of the English iron-clad ships, by the Messrs. HORSFALL. The plate was 3 feet 9 inches, by 2 feet 9 inches, by 4 3/8 inches thick, and weighed 17 cwt. The plate was placed against the ends of nine bulks of timber, 6 feet long by 14 inches square, secured together by cross-plank, and bedded in sand. The ball struck the plate a little to the left of the centre, and drove the portion against which it struck, a distance of 300 yards, shattering the whole plate, and driving the timbers to some distance. The shot was also shattered. After this report, which is official, we need stand in no fear of any mailed fleets yet afloat, if we can get a shot at them with our 15-inch guns, of which the balls weigh 425 lbs., and are driven by 40 lbs. of powder.

At the time of her abandonment the vessel was carrying a cargo of iron, under a charter to deliver it at City Point in Virginia. The owners of the cargo abandoned the cargo to the underwriters, and appeared in the salvage suit only as representing them. The vessel arrived in New-York April 10; the decree in the cause was rendered June 13; the vessel was solo June 29 to the original owners, and the cargo was sold July 5. On July 2 the owners of the vessel gave notice to the owners of the cargo, that they held themselves in readiness to forward the cargo to its destination as soon as the blockade of Virginia, established April 30, was removed, and claimed their right to hold the cargo for that purpose, and suggested that one hall of the cargo should be delivered up to satisfy the salvage decree against it, and that if the owners of the cargo desired to have the cargo remain here some settlement be made as to the freight, otherwise the vessel would claim her lien on the cargo and its proceeds for freight. No such agreement was made, and the cargo was sold, and the proceeds remaining in Court, after satisfying the salvage decree, amounting to about $6,200.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Pro Rata Freight Cargo Sold for Salvage.; UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT.

There is no doubt that a very few fifteen-inch shot would smash in the Warrior's sides if they were to hit her -- but the Warrior sails at fifteen knots, while any one fort would not be within telling shot-range of her for more than fifteen minutes. Speed, iron mail, and subdivision of attacking force, are features of modern warfare which make running the gauntlet of forts more feasible than it was in old times. It is difficult enough to hit a rapidly-moving object at all; add to this the necessity of hitting and disabling a great number of small objects -- gunboats -- while shifting their course in every direction, and the task of keeping a fleet at bay by fixed guns on shore, seems almost hopeless.

He was obliged recently to abandon his curacy because of ill-health, incurred in the discharge of his duties, and retired for a time for change of air to the residence of his friend, Rev. CHAS. SLEVIN, of Dover Plains. There, surrounded by some of his most intimate clerical friends, and having received all the consolations and graces which religion can impart, he calmly resigned himself to death. No physical pang marked his parting moments. Right Rev. Bishop LOUGHLIN, of Brooklyn, presided over the funeral ceremonies, and preached the sermon. Father SLEVIN acted as celebrant of the solemn Mass of Requiem, which was said over the remains; Father THOMAS TREANOR acted as Deacon, Father F. MCLOUGHLIN as Sub-Deacon, and Rev.

And worse than all, he so grossly misrepresented the nature of the issue between the contending parties, and so blinded and prejudiced the Foreign Office in London as to Mexican affairs generally, that his dishonest partisanship is still bearing fruit in a proposed hostile expedition and forcible intervention.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A DISCARDED DIPLOMATIST.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A DISCARDED DIPLOMATIST.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DEATHS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-10-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e179a835-e97e-52ad-90d8-4806571a836a,423,nyt://article/e179a835-e97e-52ad-90d8-4806571a836a,

And so, when they read in the columns of Northern papers of the state of feeling among us, of the settled determination to preserve the Union unbroken, and of the power that is cheerfully committed to the Government by the people for the accomplishment of that purpose; when they contrast the state of things here with that which exists throughout the Southern States -- the abundant means poured into the lap of the National Government, with the desperate shifts of the Confederate Treasury; the revival of business among us with its destruction at the South; the general prosperity which exists throughout the North, in spite of the heavy burdens of the war, with the ruin which menaces the Southern States, of which a token stares them in the face as they contrast the diminished sheets and dingy paper of the Southern newspapers with the sheets, white and sightly as of old, of the Northern paper which has been smuggled in among them; when they consider all these things, how can it be but that the soldier shall ask himself what has brought about all this difference, and what it is that he is fighting for.

This only proves that the ear is the readiest avenue to the soul, and that the preacher who undertakes another approach labors under a decided disadvantage. The dull printed page cannot convey the flashes of inspiration and conviction that fall from the pulpit; the type cannot glow and quicken like the earnest eye, the charm of eloquence fades from the printed words and we at once awake to a sad appreciation of the vast difference between spoken and written logic.

Their interest does not turn upon rhetoric alone; unlike the productions of many whose names are more prominent in the public mouth, their effectiveness does not depend principally upon trick of voice and gesture. Dr. WALKER is a deep and earnest thinker, and appeals to the intellect as well as to the ear. His words lodge and remain after the tones of the voice that uttered them have faded away. His sermons are especially commendable for their practicality. They touch the plane of every-day life, instead of reaching vaguely after an indefinite something that very few of the multitude can comprehend; and accordingly, we venture to predict that they will be read with an interest which printed sermons do not always command, while they will wield, from the forcible logic which enters into their structure, an influence which printed sermons are seldom destined to attain.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/22/archives/sermons-preached-in-harvard-college.html,,"A volume of sermons is not the book at which the general reader first grasps when an hour of leisure intervenes in his plodding toil, and he desires for the moment to unbend the bow of life, and luxuriate in some sprightly recreation.

The Administration has determined to deprive Gen. FREMONT of his command. This decision is not founded upon demonstrated unfitness of the General for the actual duties of the soldier. His courage is undisputed; his ability to lead an army into battle and manage it so as to insure victory, is untried. No one indeed will call in question the many frank and gallant qualities which have given a romantic interest to his history, and so strongly attracted the regard of a large portion of the people. But to the General in charge of a large military department, something more than the dash and chivalrous brilliancy of a gay cavalier is needed. Upon the mere military leader must be grafted great administrative ability; an acquaintance with the minutest details of business, and the ability to grasp them all; a keen insight into character, and an inflexible determination to exact honesty, fidelity and economy from all those necessarily intrusted with the conduct of detail. In these necessary qualifications Gen. FREMONT has been found lacking. It is not the Administration which has condemned him. The Congressional Committee, appointed at the extra session, to investigate the character of the army contracts, has sat at St. Louis, and patiently investigated the entire method and result of Gen. FREMONT's administration; and has been obliged to condemn and disapprove it, and to pronounce his unfitness for the position. President LINCOLN' after such an inquest and verdict, has no alternative but to transfer the General to some other theatre, where his purely military capacity may have a chance to prove itself; and to place in his stead a calmer and a more prudent officer, who shall bring to the fulfillment of his duties patience, moderation, and practical business talent.

This document represents one of his communications to contain ""treasonable matter,"" and declares the conviction of the memoralists that ""it is the design of the writer to bring the credit and fame of this Government into disrepute in foreign countries."" For such passages it is easy to judge what amount of common sense belonged to the framers and signers of the memorial. That an English writer should wish to bring the American Government into disrepute is, perhaps, an idea which might enter the minds of the most ignorant and angry citizens, but that the evil could be remedied by declaring unfreindly comments to be treasonable and ejecting the writer from the country could be the fancy only of men from whose minds passion had driven out all power of judgment. The reply of Mr. SEWARD is in substance sensible enough, though there is an evident under-current of spite, directed against English opinion in general, and the Times newspaper in particular. The politician who a few months since was for conquering Canada to make up for the loss of the South, which in his opinion it would be preposterous to attempt to coerce by war, is now as intolerant of all difference from his new creed as the memorialists themselves, though his common sense forces him to reject their application. The usual official style of ""not having read,"" and being ""engrossed with public cares and duties,"" is assumed, after the fashion of the politicians of Europe, but the accusations of ""libel,"" of ""Perverting hospitality,"" and ""writing injurious publications,"" is in accordance with the spirit of the American memorialists. However, Mr. WARD comes to the proper conclusion, that there is no reason for interference, and so far we must thank him for a just exercise of his judgment.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A PLEA FOR THE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A PLEA FOR THE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/36308a66-40b9-5b43-837c-de8f170106df,1118,nyt://article/36308a66-40b9-5b43-837c-de8f170106df,

"The difference between the Northern and Southern practice of repudiation in America is considerable, although the result to the bondholder is the same. Mississippi prefers a bold, Michigan a covert course. When Col. JEFFERSON DAVIS, in the Legislative Hall that had been built with foreign money, laughed at the ""crocodile tears"" of those who had been so foolish as to lend it, there was no attempt at sophistry. Mississippi intended to repudiate, and manifested her chivalrous pride in an open avowal of the fact. Michigan, on the contrary, resorts to subterfuges, and professes herself the victim of false accusations. She repudiates, and tries to cover her shame by fresh delinquencies. In a recent number of a leading New-York journal, the fraud practised by Michigan on her creditors is described as a ""difficulty"" about which ""financial opinion has differed on both sides of the Atlantic ever since the original default occurred;"" and a letter is inserted from Mr. JAMES F. JOY, who is mentioned as a well-known legal authority at Detroit, to prove that London capitalists are altogether wrong in classing Michigan with Mississippi as a repudiating State. But the statements of Mr. JOY, notwithstanding his rank as a legal authority in Michigan, are all erroneous. The bonds were issued by the State of Michigan to the Bank of the United States, and were to be paid for by that establishment in four half-yearly instalments. Only the first of these was met when the bank failed, but previously to that event the bank, through its agent, Mr. JAUDON, had negotiated the bonds in Europe at the price of 85 to the following houses, namely: Messsrs. DENISON & CO., of London, $900,000; Messrs. ROTHSCHILD, of Paris, $1,431,000, and Messrs. HOPE & CO., of Amsterdam, $1,252,000, the total being $3,583,000, or L716,000. Subsequently the State repudiated all liability on these bonds except for the small sum she had received from the Bank of the United States, and even in that case she proposed to deduct 25 per cent. ""damages."" Five years after the original default she offered the pittance in question, and reduced her claim for damages from 25 to 3 per cent. This proceeding was accompanied by a solemn declaration on the part of the State that she would pay no more, and some of the individuals to whom the bonds had passed, and who had been exposed to great suffering, were compelled to accept the amount and to content themselves with a formal denunciation of the iniquity that had been practiced. The version, however, now given by Mr. JAMES F. JOY, and circulated by the New-York journals, is that the amount advanced on the bonds by the European subscribers was less than that which the State of Michigan had received from the Bank of the United States, and that consequently the offer of Michigan amounted to a proposal to return them all the money they had advanced when the bonds were pledged to them. In corroboration Mr. JOY winds up by citing the fact of a large proportion of the creditors having accepted the sum accorded, in proof that they were quite satisfied, although upon application at the Treasury Department he might have been furnished with copies of the protests under which the spoliation was submitted to by a class of sufferers who knew that their debtor was not subject to any legal process, and that the only security they possessed was founded on the ""honor and good faith"" of the State in its promise to pay ""in gold or silver"" both principal and interest, with punctuality at New-York. Until the actual circumstances can be blotted from history, or the State shall have made amends, it will be better, therefore, that not only every well-known legal authority of Michigan, but also the New-York admirers of her conduct, should forbear from challenging a reproduction of the narrative. It may be desired just now to create favorable impressions of the financial antecedents of the North in contrast with those of the South, and there is no wish on this side to impede that object; but some regard must be paid to precision, and, looking at the present details, persons may possibly be found to prefer the frank style of Col. JEFFERSON DAVIS in dealing with such questions to the more special course of Mr. JAMES F. JOY.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/23/archives/eulogy-of-southern-repudiation.html,,"The difference between the Northern and Southern practice of repudiation in America is considerable, although the result to the bondholder is the same. Mississippi prefers a bold, Michigan a covert course. When Col. JEFFERSON DAVIS, in the Legislative Hall that had been built with foreign money, laughed at the ""crocodile tears"" of those who had been so foolish as to lend it, there was no attempt at sophistry. Mississippi intended to repudiate, and manifested her chivalrous pride in an open avowal of the fact. Michigan, on the contrary, resorts to subterfuges, and professes herself the victim of false accusations. She repudiates, and tries to cover her shame by fresh delinquencies. In a recent number of a leading New-York journal, the fraud practised by Michigan on her creditors is described as a ""difficulty"" about which ""financial opinion has differed on both sides of the Atlantic ever since the original default occurred;"" and a letter is inserted from Mr. JAMES F. JOY, who is mentioned as a well-known legal authority at Detroit, to prove that London capitalists are altogether wrong in classing Michigan with Mississippi as a repudiating State. But the statements of Mr. JOY, notwithstanding his rank as a legal authority in Michigan, are all erroneous. The bonds were issued by the State of Michigan to the Bank of the United States, and were to be paid for by that establishment in four half-yearly instalments. Only the first of these was met when the bank failed, but previously to that event the bank, through its agent, Mr. JAUDON, had negotiated the bonds in Europe at the price of 85 to the following houses, namely: Messsrs. DENISON & CO., of London, $900,000; Messrs. ROTHSCHILD, of Paris, $1,431,000, and Messrs. HOPE & CO., of Amsterdam, $1,252,000, the total being $3,583,000, or L716,000. Subsequently the State repudiated all liability on these bonds except for the small sum she had received from the Bank of the United States, and even in that case she proposed to deduct 25 per cent. ""damages."" Five years after the original default she offered the pittance in question, and reduced her claim for damages from 25 to 3 per cent. This proceeding was accompanied by a solemn declaration on the part of the State that she would pay no more, and some of the individuals to whom the bonds had passed, and who had been exposed to great suffering, were compelled to accept the amount and to content themselves with a formal denunciation of the iniquity that had been practiced. The version, however, now given by Mr. JAMES F. JOY, and circulated by the New-York journals, is that the amount advanced on the bonds by the European subscribers was less than that which the State of Michigan had received from the Bank of the United States, and that consequently the offer of Michigan amounted to a proposal to return them all the money they had advanced when the bonds were pledged to them.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/24/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. When the drama of ""The Octoroon"" which was revived here last night was produced some two years ago, it came on the heels of a great excitement. The John Brown raid occupied the attention of the public; the South fulminated its wrath against the North, and the loyal people of the North indignantly protested against the injurious imputation that they sympathized with the mad scheme of the unhappy Abolitionist. In the very phrenzy of this affair, Mr. BOURCICAULT, who never failed to take advantage of a powerfulcotemporaneous event, gave to the public a view of Southern life, extending even to the offensive feature of a slave sale. There was ""nothing extenuate, nor aught set down in malice."" Moderate people on both sides of the line accepted it as a fair picture of actual events. But the timid and extravagant denounced it as untimely, and there were rumors of an intended interruption of the performance. Now no one can ride out a storm with more graceful ease than Mr. BOURCICAULT, and his face actually beamed with the prospect of having a theatre torn to pieces beneath his eyes. The great public assembled on the 6th of December, 1859, to record its verdict. It heard the story of poor Zoe with tearful attention; ground its awful teeth at the villainies of McCloskey, and triumphed with the triumph of the Yankee Salem Scudder. When the piece came to an end there was a yell of approbation, every one admitted that it was a powerful drama, singularly replete with incident, had been constructed out of forbidden materials, and every one wondered why something of the kind had not been done before. Mr. BOURCICAULT, a baffled man deprived, and, as it were, defrauded of his riot, subsequently took refuge in a congenial law-suit. The papers were filled with the case of the ""Octoroon."" Since then the piece has assumed the position to which it is eminently entitled, that of being one of the few good standard plays of which the American stage can boast. We recall these circumstances because its revival last night was attended with some of the incidents which marked its production. A few persons were again pleased to regard it as untimely, why, it would be difficult to say. The public, however, reaffirmed its verdict, and we do not hesitate to predict for the piece a prosperous run. It happens, curiously enough, that the week which witnesses its revival here, will, in all probability, see its production in London, it was to have been broughtout at the Adelphi Theatre on Monday last.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/16e93669-3ffd-5ec1-84bb-3be6e8fc1893,965,nyt://article/16e93669-3ffd-5ec1-84bb-3be6e8fc1893,

The probability of an early recognition of the Southern Confederacy by France is the leading topic in the latest batch of foreign news. The several Chambers of Commerce in the Empire are said to be busily petitioning the Government to that effect.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/24/archives/france-and-the-southern-confederacy.html,,"The probability of an early recognition of the Southern Confederacy by France is the leading topic in the latest batch of foreign news. The several Chambers of Commerce in the Empire are said to be busily petitioning the Government to that effect. The Paris Presse, which, however, has no official, or even semi-official, inspiration, asserts that the mind of the Emperor is definitely fixed upon that policy, and that the time for executing it is not distant. Beyond these rumors, which may or may not be true, we have the unquestionable fact that France is, at this moment, a greater sufferer by the American war than even the United States. A Winter, which promises to be of extraordinary severity, threatens her population; while a deficient harvest has so enhanced the price of breadstuffs, that those ominous clamors for bread, so often constituting the overture of European revolutions, are already making themselves heard in Paris and Lyons, and must be silenced, or danger too great for pre-calculation will ensue. To this clamorous mob, the sudden withdrawal of American cotton, and American custom, is presently to add other multitudes. Southern doggedness and the blockade have shut off the supplies of the indispensable fibre, and the mills of Mulhausen must suspend. The prudent economy of the Northern people precludes the use of costly silks, sumptuous shawls, and impulpable laces; French wines are out of the reach of self-indulgent epicures; and whisky, unrefined by a transatlantic voyage, takes the place of brandy. Lyons, Rheims, Bordeaux, are threatened with ruin. Busy communities are everywhere reduced to idleness; idleness at a moment when even industry can hardly earn the means to buy the fuel of life.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France and the Southern Confederacy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France and the Southern Confederacy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/35df941e-46f9-5f18-92e1-d946dbfe9f28,996,nyt://article/35df941e-46f9-5f18-92e1-d946dbfe9f28,

BAKER lost his life, show that it was one of more importance than at first appeared, and resulted in advantages of a decided character to our army. It appears, also, to have been somewhat unpremeditated. The enemy's scouts were first discovered by the Thirteenth Massachusetts Regiment, who were stationed on Hamilton Island, and five companies were ordered to advance and repulse the enemy, which they did, and returned. The enemy, however, soon reappeared in considerable numbers, and attacked the Massachusetts men, who were soon reinforced, and the fighting became more serious. Gen. STONE rapidly passed his men over the river at Hamilton Island and at Edwards' Ferry. At the latter point the enemy appeared to the number of five thousand, under command of Gen. EVANS, with cavalry and artillery; and here Col. BAKER fell, while gallantly leading a charge. Our troops subsequently fell back, but held possession of the Virginia side, and the enemy did not renew the attack. It is understood that on Monday night Gen. BANKS moved his division across the river at Hamilton Island and Edwards' Ferry, and that the two divisions of Gens. BANKS and STONE are now combined, under the command of the former. The enemy did not renew the attack on Tuesday, but it is understood that they were heavily reinforced, and another engagement was expected. Gen. MCCLELLAN spent the day with Gen. BANKS yesterday, and the army will probably move upon Leesburgh to-day, everything being in readiness for the advance.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bf3ff3b1-16c2-53e2-8b80-a46bb503830a,1228,nyt://article/bf3ff3b1-16c2-53e2-8b80-a46bb503830a,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/25/archives/bile-on-the-brain.html,,"If our amiable friend of the Herald were a drinking man we should have no doubt that he is afflicted with delirium tremens. His columas give evidence of disease of some kind in the ravings which fill them, day after day, about the TIMES and Tribune. There is a little too much method in his balderdash, however, -- too evident a desire to hurt somebody, to make such an explanation plausible. Under all the insane bluster and lying braggadocio with which he amuses and instructs his readers, lurks a venemous spite which betrays the systematic malignity which is among the most amiable and conspicuous characteristics of that modest journalist. The assiduity with which he pries into the private business affairs of his neighbors, -- the charming impartiality with which he lies or tells the truth, as may best serve his turn -- his contemptuous disregard of all the considerations which influence men who have any reputation to lose, or any social position to maintain, give a touch of heroism to what in any less gifted and unscrupulous scamp would be merely repulsive. The old reprobate reminds one of the standard villain of the novelist, -- a bad Jesuit priest though he adds some touches of character which are peculiarly his own. If such a priest were to be kicked out of his parish for immorality, out of his family for cold-blooded brutality, and out of society because he was universally regarded as a slimy and viperous nuisance, he would have just about the education, the propensities and the experience required for the work which the Herald performs. BENNETT will regard it as a compliment when we say that he is quite adequate to the task without any such preliminary training.

This confession, uttered in the Capital of Rebeldom, and directly under the noses of the despots that rule there, is the most notable thing that has yet come to us from the seceding States. It is evidence that the actual condition of the rebels is rapidly being understood by themselves. They do not act upon the offensive because they cannot. A defensive policy is nothing less than destruction, because it allows the North to take away from the South every attribute of independence, if not the very means of existence. What is the condition of a people who depend, for almost every luxury and necessity, upon other nations, and are completely cut off from intercourse with all others? For one whose productions and social organization are like those of the South, it is subjection in its harshest and most odious form. Suppose the Government should not proceed a step further, except to rigidly enforce the blockade, and protect the loyal States, can the rebels put forth a single claim to have their assumed nationality respected?

SHERMAN graduated at West Point, and served with distinction in the Mexican War, under TAYLOR and SCOTT. He was breveted Major for gallant and meritorious conduct at the battle of Buena Vista. In the Mexican War he commanded and gave his name to ""Sherman's Battery,"" which he organized in Mexico. When this secession war broke out Gen. SHERMAN was doing duty on the frontier. Gen. SHERMAN is a native of Rhode Island. It was his namesake, Gen. W.T. SHERMAN, (the successor of Gen. ANDERSON in Kentucky,) who commanded a brigade at the battle of Bull Run. Gen. SHERMAN arrived at Fortress Monroe on Tuesday last, and sailed the following day. His headquarters are on board the Atlantic. Our correspondent states that the land force of the expedition will reach 15,000. This is not the entire force. It is supposed that additional troops will be taken from Fortress Monroe, but we have no means as yet of knowing what these troops are.

It is the debtor class we speak of -- those who were owing various amounts of money, large and small, to citizens of the Northern States, which it was inconvenient to pay. War, it was foreseen, would extinguish all business relations between the North and South, and destroy the ability, if it did not forfeit the right, of the Northern creditor to coerce the payment of debts owed by people in the South. The amount of Southern indebtedness to the North is enormous. It has been the chronic relation of the two sections to each other -- that of creditor on the one side, and debtor on the other. The balance has been for many years, and was at the beginning of secession, and is now, hundreds of millions of dollars in favor of the North. Secession was considered a respectable dodge for repudiation. It cloaked, under the garb of ""loyalty to the South,"" the private dishonor of swindling one's creditors. It promised relief from pressing obligations, and a rich reward in the private appropriation of the merchandise of Northern men incautiously credited to Southern dealers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Swindling Secessionists in Grief.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Swindling Secessionists in Grief.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5f3e66a3-489b-5ef8-998b-5497f28097a9,699,nyt://article/5f3e66a3-489b-5ef8-998b-5497f28097a9,

The London Morning Herald (Derbyite) has some very sensible remarks upon the incongruity presented by the British Government, as compared with the Russian, at this critical period. It seems passing strange that the Government of Great Britain, which has always made such great professions of being the bulwark of liberty for the oppressed, especially now that it is represented by the Liberal wing, headed by Lord PALMERSTON, should have manifested so openly its wish for the disruption of the Union, and the success of the Confederates. It is the only nation which has openly shown a determination to favor the Southern Confederates, and it has been put to the blush by the frank expressions of the Emperor of Russia in favor of the United States. The policy of Russia has completely nonplussed the English. They had a suspicion that they had terribly blundered when LOUIS NAPOLEON refused to encourage the Southern Confederates. The policy of France occasioned a modification of the tone adopted by the British Cabinet and Press; that of Russia cannot fail to have a decided influence upon England.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and Russia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and Russia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/61e9f99d-f502-5d7d-bb69-a98968268215,984,nyt://article/61e9f99d-f502-5d7d-bb69-a98968268215,

Let us, then, abolish the common school system of secular education in all those Free States; let us split up in to ""four or more"" (well, say a hundred,) of what [???] calls ""separate and sovereign commonwealths;"" let us issue a paper edict, (or a score of them,) abolishing Slavery; let us restrict the privilege of suffrage to nabobs; let us adopt the patriarchal principle -- after we discover what it is; let us abolish the Morrill tariff, the Republic, and -- as Mr. ALISON desires -- the belief in original sin and in a plurality of gods; let us curtail the national prosperity which afflicts us, by burning down New-York, burning up our mercantile marine, destroying our manufactures, and investing in the British funds whatever cash we may have left; and let us select a king from some of the scrofulous royal scallawags of Europe. And then, if all these means fail to pacify the fighting democracy, let us invite John Bull to take our case in hand, as he now proposes to take our sister Republic of Mexico, and govern us, as he governs India, by fire and sword.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANGLICAN POLITICAL QUACKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANGLICAN POLITICAL QUACKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b012c255-31fa-507b-9685-280dd985c07e,608,nyt://article/b012c255-31fa-507b-9685-280dd985c07e,

The principles it advocates were long ago defunct and belong to a past age. It ignores all the great moral revolutions which have occurred in Great Britain during the last quarter of a century, and writes as if there had been no great measures of Parliamentary reform, no repeal of the Corn laws, no spread of education, no legal amendments -- all calculated to extend the power of the people and increase the democratic element in the State. In the number of that periodical for the present month appears an article styled; ""Democracy Teaching by Example,"" in which the writer, after imputing to us everything that is corrupt in our Government, proceeds to justify the rebellion of the Southern States under the terms of the Constitution, and in a tone of pity for our unfortunate condition recommends us to retire from a conflict which is ""making the Government of the North ridiculous in the eyes of Europe."" He exults in the thought that the great experiment of a Republic has signally failed, and kindly suggests to us to yield at once with a good grace -- to allow the South to have their own monarch, and that we also should be permitted to select our own. Unless a king is to spring already armed for us from the brain of Jupiter, he does not inform us where we are to find that expensive luxury; but as he alludes in terms of high praise to the beneficent rule of the Emperor of Austria and the King of Naples, he would probably expect us to send for the last relic of the Bourbon dynasty, and adopt that gentleman, now ""out of place,"" by the soubriquet of ""Francis the First"" of North America.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What the Tories Think.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What the Tories Think.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-10-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/59dbb140-7ee4-54ef-8e23-372be1f0f2c9,520,nyt://article/59dbb140-7ee4-54ef-8e23-372be1f0f2c9,
