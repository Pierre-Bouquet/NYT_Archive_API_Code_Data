"PARIS, Nov. 18. -- Prince Louis Napoleon has arrived from Russia on a two months' visit to France. He has alighted at a hotel in the Champs Elysees, but it is already announced that he intends to keep very quiet, and to see only his intimate friends. This means that the Prince means to hold himself quite aloof from French politics, and is, more-over, determined to refuse to discuss the situation in Russia.
