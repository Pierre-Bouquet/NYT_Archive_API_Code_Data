There has been considerable difficulty in procuring enough uniforms for all who have ordered them. The enameled cloth in which they are fashioned is for the most part manufactured in New-Jersey and New-England, and the mills have been unable to supply the sudden demand for it. Hundreds of women and many a man in this City have been engaged for weeks past in making caps and capes for Wide-Awakes in various parts of the country, and they are still stitching away for dear life. Although the orders come in so thick and fast that the tailor and his assistants are hardly able to fulfill them, yet enough of the equipments have been manufactured to insure the computed size of the procession if there are men enough to fill all the uniforms that are in being. Undoubtedly many members of Companies that design visiting New-York on the 3d will be found wanting when the time comes; the experience of all who have taken part in public pageants demonstrates that it will be so; but it is claimed that every Club will find hosts of Republicans outside of its organization ready to don the uniform of each delinquent, so that the ranks of all will be full in spite of all contingencies.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.; The Great Parade of the Wide-Awakes on Wednesday.CHARACTER OF THE DEMONSTRATION.

Leaving Callensburgh the party drove to Sunbury, Butler County, arriving there late at night. Proceeding at once to the house of a man named JAMES WILSON, they woke him out of bed, and took him into custody. In his house they found a coin press and dies for dimes, quarter eagles and Mexican dollars, with a considerable amount of bogus money, and two large packages of counterfeit bills, all of which are now in possession of the Police.

They failed to find what they wanted here, but in searching a house owned by STITZ. and occupied but a short time before by a party of prostitutes now in Clarion jail, they discovered a large amount of stolen goods, including a considerable quantity of jewelry. Leaving Callensburgh the party drove to Sunbury, Butler County, arriving there late at night. Proceeding at once to the house of a man named JAMES WILSON, they woke him out of bed, and took him into custody. In his house they found a coin press and dies for dimes, quarter eagles and Mexican dollars, with a considerable amount of bogus money, and two large packages of counterfeit bills, all of which are now in possession of the Police. WILSON is a man of considerable means, and owns a large farm in the nighborhood. He took his arrest very hard, and seemed fully alive to the peril of his position. The bills consist of ""twos"" on the Agricultural Bank of Morion, Illinois, and ""threes"" on the Bank of New-Jersey, New-Brunswick.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 6 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 6 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4e009120-514e-520a-875c-80fd31d2efac,495,nyt://article/4e009120-514e-520a-875c-80fd31d2efac,

On Saturday the Cortesi troupe, like the Bourbons of Naples, abandoned the field, and left to Mr. STRAKOSH and Mr. ULLMAN an undisputed kingdom. The latter returned in the Persia from a ravaging tour, in which he has despoiled all the opera-houses of Europe of their richest treasures of song. We are promised Mlle.

On the Monday following the Earl was brought to the Police Court under the following circumstances: On Sunday morning he went on the Holyhead line of railway, and persisted in walking through a tunnel. The Policeman there would not allow him, and took him to the Police Office. After being kept there for a few hours he was set free, and in the afternoon he went to the Cathedral. Here he would not take his hat off, and he was removed by force. He was then taken to the Royal Hotel, where he remained all night. The first thing on Monday morning he got out into the streets naked, and was again made captive. About 12 o'clock he went to the Bishop of Chester's palace, and so annoyed his lordship that he requested the police to take charge of him. Upon coming into court the carl went right up to the bench and seated himself with his hat on. He commenced a long, rambling statement -- said the Bishop of Chester had insulted the House of Lords through him, and he would bring his lordship to justice at the bar of the House in the next session, and deprive him of his living. He intended to write to his friends, Messrs. BRIGHT and COBDEN, to bring the matter before the House. Bishops had no right to be seated in that House, and he would see that it should he altered. He was going to write to his lawyer, Lord CHELMSFORD, to enter an action against the Holyhead Railway Company for £100,000 for insulting him.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/02/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The advices by the Glasgow, whose arrival off Cape Race is announced, are of the highest importance. The Sardinian invasion of the Pontifical Dominions is already completely successful, and the object for which VICTOR EMANUEL drew the sword has been achieved. Gen. LAMORICIERE's band of mercenaries have been defeated, with severe loss. The telegram does not mention the place at which this decisive battle was fought, but, judging by the events which immediately preceded it, there is scarcely any room to doubt that Gen. CIALDINI and his Sardinians, aided by the late Neapolitan fleet, defeated LAMORICIERE at Ancona, where he had fortified himself. Perugia, Spoletto, and other places, had previously fallen into the hands of the Sardinians. A rumor, which requires confirmation, was current that the Pope had fled. This intelligence is scarcely to be credited, as the safety of His Holiness, and of the city of Rome, have been solemnly guaranteed both by France and Sardinia. GARIBALDI was engaged at Naples in organizing an Italian army. It is reported that the Liberator was on the eve of starting for Venetia, and that Gen. SCITORI would take the command of the army during his absence. The miscellaneous intelligence by this arrival is also of an interesting character. A madman had attempted to take the life of the Emperor of the French, but his design was providentially frustrated. It has been officially announced in London that Mr. LINDSAY, now in this country, has no authority to negotiate with the Government of the United States relative to the shipping interest.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/02/archives/walkers-surrender.html,,"-- We have received, by way of New-Orleans, some particulars of the capture of the Walker expedition after the flight from Truxillo. The party which pursued WALKER up the Rio Negro was composed of British Marines and Hondurean troops. WALKER surrendered to the former; and before he was handed over to the authorities of Honduras, Commander SALMON, of the Icarus, exacted a promise that the prisoners should not be harmed until his return from the Belize, where he immediately went to get fresh orders. WALKER was shot on the 1st of September, during the absence of the Icarus, in violation of an express stipulation. There is no basis for the supposition that the British officer was responsible for his safety; between him and WALKER there was no agreement whatever, and could be none. WALKER himself forfeited all claims to mercy when he refused the conditions of surrender offered him in Truxillo. The relations of the parties then became different. Captain SALMON no longer acted in an independent capacity. He was now the agent of the Honduras Government. He conveyed its troops to the Rio Negro, helped to capture WALKER, and had no choice but to deliver him up when required to do so.

Last evening the new Seventh Regiment Armory, comprising the second and third floors of the new Tompkins Market, was occupied for the first time, to any extent, and thrown open for public inspection. Although by no means finished, the rooms already show how great will be the improvement upon the old quarters. There are on the second floor ten company meeting rooms, measuring 22 feet by 40, comprising quarters for the Artillery, Engineer and Drum corps; a fine officer's meeting-room 40 feet by 44, and a company drill-room 40 feet by 75. The First Company (Capt. BENSEL) meeting-room is the only one yet near completion. It is stocked with solid black walnut gun-cases, decks and furniture, elegant curtains and neat window-shades, at a cost of about $1,500. The officer's meeting-room is elegantly carpeted, furnished with tasty and durable chairs, desks, bookcase, color closet and table of carved black-walnut. Over Col. LEFFERT's seat is hung the picture recently presented to the Regiment by the Baltimore City Guard. The cost of fitting up this room was about $3,000. The remaining rooms are being rapidly put in order, and will probably be all in readiness about Nov. 1st. The regimental drill-room, covering the upper floor of the market, will serve to drill the entire corps, no doubt securing a proficiency heretofore unattained only for the want of just such accommodations.

"drama, ""of Irish character and construction,"" as the bills phrase it, was produced, last night, at this popular establishment. It is founded on one of CARLETON'S charming tales, in his ""Traits and Sketches of the Irish Peasantry.""  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/02/archives/laura-keenes-theatre.html,,"-- A new three act drama, ""of Irish character and construction,"" as the bills phrase it, was produced, last night, at this popular establishment. It is founded on one of CARLETON'S charming tales, in his ""Traits and Sketches of the Irish Peasantry."" The title given to it by its adapter, (Mr. DE WALDEN, we believe,) is ""Aileen Aroon, or the Lady of Glanmire."" The plot is soon told. Aileen (Miss LAURA KEENE) has loved a young doctor named Philip Warner, (Mr. LEVICK,) but, in the usual course of true love, has failed to marry him. Gorman Baradan (Mr. DALY) having rescued her father from difficulties, proposes for her hand, and, as a mark of her gratitude, she becomes his wife, without intensely reciprocating his affection. On the day of their wedding, while they are staying at an inn, Warner arrives. He meets Aileen, and learns that she is united to another man. He leaves the inn precipitately, but the boat in which he embarks is capsized in a storm, and he is saved by Baradan. In the second act, the health of Baradan rapidly fails, and he seems to be dying by slow poison. Appearances strongly point to Aileen, his wife as the guilty party. His old schoolfellow and late comrade, Shandy Maginnis, (Mr. T.B. JOHNSTON,) strengthens the suspicion, and so works on Baradan's mind, that he accuses Aileen of the fearful intent upon his life, and makes Shandy his hair. Through the agency of Father McPhaudeen, (Mr. LEESON,) the young doctor, Warner, is employed to cure the mysterious ailment, and while so engaged he discovers that Shandy is the poisoner. In order to allay the superstitious prejudices of the peasantry, who all believe that Aileen is the criminal, an appeal is had to the Donagh, a sacred book, supposed, to have been given by St. Patrick to the people of Enniskillen. Whoever swears on this Donagh that he is innocent of the crime charged, if he perjures himself, is immediately punished in this world, and is consigned to perdition forever after Aileen swears, and is acquitted by acclamation. Shane, after fearful hesitation, is about to swear, when the Baradan appears, safe and sound, -- the effects of the poison having been neutralized by Warner -- in time to prevent his committing perjury and the piece ends in an unsullied prospect of perpetual felicity.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LAURA KEENE'S THEATRE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""LAURA KEENE'S THEATRE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc35059c-e3f6-5031-b05d-5d8046e07abe,458,nyt://article/fc35059c-e3f6-5031-b05d-5d8046e07abe,

For no sooner does a term of judicial imbecility and injustice in the administration of criminal law draw toward its close, than both factions of a dominant political party hasten to rescue that department from falling into decent hands, by nominating for both places on the criminal bench candidates, the incapacity of one of whom has been amply demonstrated by his now expiring judicial career, while that of the other is made too apparent to require experimental proof, by his declaration that if elected he will ""serve the interests of his friends and his party,"" and that he is willing to pay whatever amount his friends may assess, to obtain the place. The action of the Mozart faction, which we reported yesterday, altering the Tammany nominations only by substituting the name of Judge RUSSELL for the Recordership, shows that they are even more willing than their brethren of the Wigwam to bring the judiciary into utter and lasting contempt; while both branches of the party unite in nominating for a seat on the Supreme Bench, a man whose qualifications as little fit him for the post, as the education of a life in the wilderness would fit a painted savage for a seat on the throne of France.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our City Judiciary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our City Judiciary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/178cd027-d6ea-5ca1-834c-4a5214d27bfa,686,nyt://article/178cd027-d6ea-5ca1-834c-4a5214d27bfa,

LAMORICIERE  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/03/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"By the North American at Quebec. and the Canada off Cape Race, we are placed in possession of three days' later European news. The details received of the late Sardinian victory near Ancona are of tile greatest interest. Gen. LAMORICIERE was the attacking party, and his defeat was decisive and complete. The General fled to Ancona, which contains all that is left of the disorganized levies of the Pope. A large portion of Gen. LAMORICIERE's troops capitulated on the field of battle, and the remnant in Ancona have no other course left but to follow their example. Among the prisoners taken at Spoletto were six hundred of the Irish Brigade. The effect of this battle is to transfer the whole of the Roman territory from the dominion of the Pope to that of VICTOR EMAMUEL, who is now, in very deed, King of Italy. It is true that Rome, Viterbo and Civita Vecchia have been guaranteed by France to the Sovereign Pontiff; but His Holiness is said to be preparing an alocution, in which he will declare his determination to withdraw from Rome. This will relieve the Emperor NAPOLEON from his present very embarrassing position, for as soon as the Pope leaves, the French troops will leave also, and the Sardinians will occupy the Eternal City. The great danger to the ultimate success of the revolution appears to lie in the contest now going on between GARIBALDI and the Count DE CAVOUR. The former has written to the King, peremptorily demanding the Minister's dismissal. Austria is making enormous military preparations in Venetia and on the shores of the Adriatic, but she will not oppose the revolution unless her Italian possessions are attacked. That they will be attacked, no one who believes in GARIBALDI can doubt.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8832ec0b-bab1-542c-948d-bded153a6dfd,1381,nyt://article/8832ec0b-bab1-542c-948d-bded153a6dfd,
"McSpedon & Baker vs. Blunt, et al. -- This action was brought by the plaintiffs to recover damages of the defendants for an alleged false return to the mandamus issued in the action brought by the plaintiffs herein against the Board of Supervisors for an amount claimed on account of work done under contract with the Record Commissioners. The mandamus and the return thereto have been many times stated in the TIMES, and will be readily remembered. The plaintiffs claimed that there were due them, under the contract referred to, $193,000.

The Evening-school Committee submitted a report, furnishing the names of teachers appointed in each school and salary of each teacher. The report was adopted.

To-day the long down-trodden people of Italy were following the brave GARIBALDI [cheers] to recover their rights, to revenge the wrongs of their country, and to vindicate the rights of human nature. But they whom he addressed lived in a Republic in which every man could go to the ballot-box, change the Administration, and reform the policy of the Government. They owed a great duty to the country and to themselves, and that duty imposed upon them the necessity of voting so as to promote the interests and the honor of their country, and to advance the cause of human liberty generally. Since the dawn of creation -- since the day when the serpent whispered words of deceit and disobedience into the ears of Mother Eve, up to the present moment, there had been a conflict going on -- an ""irrepressible conflict"" -- [applause] -- a conflict which should be continued to be waged till mankind learned the great lesson of human rights. The Presidential election here was always of the deepest interest to the people. None had so deep, so absorbing, so abiding an interest in the results of the coming contest as the toiling millions of America; for on them it depended whether there would be homes for the free white man, or whether the Territories of the country would be reserved for slave labor. There were upwards of twenty millions of men in the Free States who enjoyed all the rights of freemen. They had a free Press and free speech; free schools, free Churches and free labor. In fine, in the words of DANIEL WEBSTER: ""Here free labor looks up, and is free in the midst of its toil."" In the Free States the toiling masses of mankind wielded more power, and had more means of elevating themselves to position, than were ever dreamt of before, and such as the laboring millions of no other country ever before enjoyed.

"A really crowded and brilliant house last evening greeted the debut of Miss ADELINA PATTI in the passionate and pathetic opera of ""La Traviata."" There are divers ways of achieving a success in the character of Violetta. Mlle. PICCOLOMINI carried London and New-York before her, in this character, by dealing with it en jeune ingenue, with no particular regard for the music of the role. She sang as her voice and her method permitted her to sing, but she acted with a specific reference to the impressionability of the London omnibus-box, and of the loungers of the New-York parquette, audiences not very likely to confer the enduring crown of song, but quite capable of making the fortune of an actress, when that actress is young, piquant and pretty as a pigeon. Madame FABBRI, with higher musical gifts, combines an intensity of dramatic feeling, which makes the role of Violetta pitiably real when she fills it, and moves people not apt to sympathize with the omnibus-box and the loungers of the parquette. Miss PATTI throws herself entirely upon the music, and conquers it with that facile grace which is the chief characteristic of her style, and her best letter of operatic credit. Her reckless ecstacy of the first act, and her despair of the finale, savor more of the boarding-school than of life, and it would be idle to say that she either comprehended or pretended to create the role in its dramatic aspects. But she sang its partition incredibly well, with a fluency, delicacy and accuracy little less than amazing, and for this deserved the plaudits which she received. Signor BRIGNOLI merits other and higher praise, and the event of last evening was the rich and ample development which this accomplished tenor gave to his voice -- a jewel of the first price, certainly, but which he is too apt to keep, perhaps for that reason, over-carefully locked in his musical ecrin.

"The phrase ""Popular Sovereignty"" is potent in the mouth of the stump orator and the demagogue, because it is redolent of the great truths which lie at the basis of our free institutions.

"There must have been an ""irrepressible conflict"" between the political sympathies of the male and female guests of the St. Nicholas Hotel last evening, for while the former ranged themselves on the sidewalk in front of the hotel, and there, almost to a man, manifested in various ways their dislike and disgust at the whole Wide-Awake procession as it passed in review before them, the former presented their beautiful faces, like clusters of roses, at each of the 150 windows that look out on Broadway from the upper stories, and by constant smiles and waving of handkerchiefs testified their delight and approbation of the whole affair. So unanimous and hearty was the Wide-Awake demonstration on the part of the ladies, that one of the male guests on the sidewalk, on looking up and beholding the extent of the fluttering linen overhead, declared that ""he'd be d_____d if he didn't believe the St. Nicholas was tinctured with Black Republicanism, and he reckoned he'd change his quarters to-morrow."" The procession reached the St. Nicholas about 8 1/2 o'clock, and its approach was the signal for a general outburst of groans, hisses, cat-yawls and sheep-blats, from the aforesaid gentlemen on the walks, all of which was more than counteracted by the quiet and graceful demonstration of delight from the fair faces above them. The Wide-Awakes took no notice of the animal noises on the walk, but lifting their eyes to the angels overhead, returned their salutations by raising their hats and cheering them as they passed. Counter cheers were gotten up by the sidewalk guests for all sorts of persons and things. There were cheers for BRECKINRIDGE, cheers for DOUGLAS, cheers for HOUSTON, cheers for BELL, and one enthusiastic Southerner proposed ""Three cheers for more Slave States."" which sentiment was heartily responded to. This gentleman, who was said to be a Georgian, appeared to be the spokesman of the Southern portion of the sidewalk, and did pretty much all the talking for the whole crowd in front of the hotel. He was blessed with a pair of lungs scarcely inferior to those of a Durham bull, and his voice could be heard at least two squares above the din of the music, and all the other concomitant noises of the procession. He proposed the sentiments, started the counter cheers, initiated the groans, and in fact led off in all the opposition demonstrations of the sidewalk. Besides leading the opposition forces, he kept up a running fire at the procession on his own hook, in the way of verbal commentary, for about an hour, when he subsided, declared he was going into the hotel to take a drink, and was seen no more. In the beginning of his commentary he exhibited considerable anger, and appeared anxious for a fight, but he soon got better natured, and before he left was quite humorous. When the procession first hove in sight, he led off in something like the following strain: ""You're a pretty lot of suckers. Where did you get your cloaks from?

So unanimous and hearty was the Wide-Awake demonstration on the part of the ladies, that one of the male guests on the sidewalk, on looking up and beholding the extent of the fluttering linen overhead, declared that ""he'd be d_____d if he didn't believe the St. Nicholas was tinctured with Black Republicanism, and he reckoned he'd change his quarters to-morrow."" The procession reached the St. Nicholas about 8 1/2 o'clock, and its approach was the signal for a general outburst of groans, hisses, cat-yawls and sheep-blats, from the aforesaid gentlemen on the walks, all of which was more than counteracted by the quiet and graceful demonstration of delight from the fair faces above them. The Wide-Awakes took no notice of the animal noises on the walk, but lifting their eyes to the angels overhead, returned their salutations by raising their hats and cheering them as they passed. Counter cheers were gotten up by the sidewalk guests for all sorts of persons and things. There were cheers for BRECKINRIDGE, cheers for DOUGLAS, cheers for HOUSTON, cheers for BELL, and one enthusiastic Southerner proposed ""Three cheers for more Slave States."" which sentiment was heartily responded to. This gentleman, who was said to be a Georgian, appeared to be the spokesman of the Southern portion of the sidewalk, and did pretty much all the talking for the whole crowd in front of the hotel. He was blessed with a pair of lungs scarcely inferior to those of a Durham bull, and his voice could be heard at least two squares above the din of the music, and all the other concomitant noises of the procession. He proposed the sentiments, started the counter cheers, initiated the groans, and in fact led off in all the opposition demonstrations of the sidewalk. Besides leading the opposition forces, he kept up a running fire at the procession on his own hook, in the way of verbal commentary, for about an hour, when he subsided, declared he was going into the hotel to take a drink, and was seen no more.

The Sardinian forces continued their advance into the Papal States, and had captured the fortress of Santo Leo. The bombardment of Ancona by sea and land continued. GARIBALDI had concentrated his troops on the heights of Valtoona, preparatory to attacking the Neapolitans. The Dictator had issued a fresh proclamation, indicating that he would join the Sardinian troops at Rome and begin a march against Venice. The official journal at Rome contains the note of Cardinal ANTONELLI, claiming the assistance of the Catholic Powers. Some addittional European news is also received by the Connaught, whose arrival at St. Johns was announced in yesterday's TIMES. The breach between GARIBALDI and the Count DE CAVOUR threatens to be a serious obstacle to the complete success of the revolution. It is reported that VICTOR EMANUEL will go to Naples for a personal incourse with GARIBALDI. Further details of LAMORICIERE's defeat near Ancona show that 600 prisoners were taken by the Sardinians, and that 4,000 of the Papal troops capitulated. The mails by the Canadian steamship North American reached this City yesterday. They include Paris and London journals of the 20th ult. -- one day later than those brought by the Arago -- and furnish us with interesting particulars of intelligence previously received. The Glasgow also arrived at this port last night. Her advices have been anticipated. The telegraph lines of the New-York and Newfoundland Telegraph Company, extending from Port Hood to St. Johns and Cape Race, N.F., and from Sackville, N.B., to Charlottetown, P.E.I., -in all about eight or nine hundred miles in extent -have been leased for a term of years by the New-York Associated Press, and the services of Mr. A.M. MACKAY, the past and present excellent General Superintendent of the lines, have been retained. The new arrangement goes into effect on the 1st of November next. Much more extended arrangements are being made to intercept the European steamers off Cape Race, with every prospect of obtaining news from a large proportion of the passing steamers, which now number about two hundred per annum from Europe.

The question in the case is, whether or not Atwater, who sold and conveyed her to the claimant, had, at the time of the conveyance, obtained the title of the libelants. We agree, if he possessed the title at the time, though obtained through fraud and covin, the claimant being a bona fide purchaser, is to be protected. And hence the libelants are bound to show that they have not parted with the title, or in other words, that Atwater had not acquired it. It is quite clear, if the question was simply between the libelants and Atwater, or between Mix and them, from whom Atwater derived the possession, there could be no great difficulty in disposing of it, as Mix took possession professedly for the benefit of the libelants, and the proofs show that Atwater is chargeable with notice of the circumstances, and acted in the sale to the claimant in collusion with Mix.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Appeal in Admiralty.; POSSESSION OF VESSEL CALIFORNIA STATUTE POWER OF ATTORNEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Appeal in Admiralty.; POSSESSION OF VESSEL CALIFORNIA STATUTE POWER OF ATTORNEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68362e08-6ff5-5ab0-81d8-c9a1fd559883,1162,nyt://article/68362e08-6ff5-5ab0-81d8-c9a1fd559883,

The Executive Committee, in several pamphlets they have issued, avow their determination to break up the New-York Press Association, and to start rival news agencies for the supply of telegraphic intelligence to the newspapers. What they seek to accomplish by this, according to their own statement, is to compel the newspapers to expend more money on the telegraph. Instead of having one dispatch used by seven or eight papers, who divide the expense among them, the committee think that a separate dispatch should come, and be paid for by each separate newspaper, -- so that the company's receipts for each item of news might be multiplied sevenfold.

He has contrived (probably through the assistance of some mercenary yellow-plush) to insinuate a quizzical paper prepared by himself into the same envelopes with the ""invitations"" issued to the General Committee, the tenor of which is so cruelly insulting to the flower of our fashion, that we should not be at all surprised, in case the author shall be discovered, to hear of his being beaten to death with mauve-colored gloves, or strangled with perfumed pocket-handkerchiefs. In this document our anonymous Theodore Hook avails himself of the opportunity to snub all female Gotham by stating that all the ladies who propose coming to the Prince's Ball must understand that ""under no consideration can they be admitted with bonnets."" He then goes on to inform all gentlemen ""not entitled to wear uniforms, ""that they will be expected to appear in evening dress, viz.: black trowsers, black dress-coat, black waistcoat and white cravat, or white waistcoat and black cravat, (the former preferable,) and light colored kid gloves."" Now, this would be a very good joke, perhaps, at the right time and in the right place. It is possible that a generous and microscopic mind might discern some faint quality of fun in a lesson on costume, delivered by a Broadway tailor to an audience of the townsmen of Hardscrabble, bent on a Royal ball. But when a man's humor or ill-humor leads him to publish such a sermon on the toilette to the whole world, as a fit and proper and necessary preparation of the ""elite of New-York"" for a ball given exclusively by invitation to less than one numerical third of the traditional ""upper ten thousand,"" the thing ceases to be even approximately witty, and subsides into an uncertainty over which one hardly knows whether to laugh or to use strong language.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Tailors on the Prince's Ball."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Tailors on the Prince's Ball."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f2b672b-8cfa-5f71-933e-1e315150226e,1262,nyt://article/2f2b672b-8cfa-5f71-933e-1e315150226e,

The said article then suppresses the case of a profligate or fraudulent debtor, owing two or three thousand dollars to honest creditors, who know him to possess the means of payment, or desire to punish him for the false representations on which he obtained their trust. Judgment is obtained against him, and the man is seized; he is sent to Eldridge-street prison, and that is the first step towards his release. Locked up there, one of the ready turnkeys will not fail to advise him to trust his case to Cook & Co., who are the legal practitioners most largely engaged in this business. The man then finds out that he owes about ten thousand dollars to some gentleman named Jones, or Brown, or some two gentlemen named Robinson and Jenkins; whereupon the second step towards liberation has been taken.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The City Judge and Insolvent Debtors Affidavit of John Cook, Esq.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The City Judge and Insolvent Debtors Affidavit of John Cook, Esq.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/726e2805-7ba0-554a-9630-edd9911e387e,1247,nyt://article/726e2805-7ba0-554a-9630-edd9911e387e,

"At the Broadway Tabernacle, on Sunday evening, Rev. Dr. JOSEPH P. THOMPSON, the pastor, delivered a sermon -- the occasion being the jubilee of the American Board of Foreign Missions. He took as his text Zechariah iv., 10, in the course of which he gave a sketch of the origin, in 1810, and progress of the work of foreign missions. He forcibly marked the contrast between its first efforts, by which $999 99 were raised and four missionaries sent forth, and its present labors, with its $430,000 contributed in the past year and its 1,300 representatives in the field. The calls of Divine Providence on the one hand, and the outrageous outbreaks of human wickedness upon the other demanded renewed energy and faith and consecration for the missionary service. Along with the wonderful openings of Providence for good there were outgrowths of human wickedness, which showed that Satan was not idle, and that the conflict for the ascendency of truth and righteousness must yet be severe. The wild, fierce tragedy of fanaticism in Lebanon, which had sent a thrill of horror through the whole world, and the audacious demand here that Slavery should be recognized as a Christian institution, and inaugurated as a part of our national policy, were proofs that the Devil was not yet chained up. When the American Board war organized, everybody looked for the speedy cessation of Slavery itself, as an iniquity that must die out before the light of freedom and Christianity. Yet now men calling themselves Christians, who gave largely for foreign missions, pretended to doubt whether it was wise, and safe, and patriotic to talk against Slavery as a system of iniquity, and to vote against its extension. The most serious obstacle to their missionary operations at the Gaboon was the Slave-trade, conducted by Americans. He was informed by returned missionaries that they saw men flourishing here in Broadway who at the Gaboon had been engaged in the Slave-trade. This City was interested in the traffic to an increasing and alarming extent.

KELLY, Captain of the schooner Catharine Margaret, of West Farms, Westchester County, NEW-YORK. The general impression of the friends of deceased, as well as all others acquainted with the facts, ic that the Captain came to his death by foul play. On Sunday forenoon, the 30th of September, the Catharine Margaret was discovered lying at anchor about 100 yards from the Hoboken Ferry, loaded with brick, with her signal-light burning, and the vessel in a sinking condition. Several persons went out in small boats to render assistance, and on arriving at the vessel, found no person on board. In the cabin was found a piece of fresh beef, some potatoes, cabbages, &c., and a bottle of gin, and apparently these articles had been brought on board very recently. The vessel was towed on to the flats, where it shortly after sunk. Since that time the friends of the Captain have been on the look-out to ascertain the cause of his mysterious disappearance without success, until the finding of his body on Sunday. Justice WHITLEY, of Hoboken, viewed the body, and it is stated, without taking any evidence, gave permission to the friends to remove it to Westchester County. A young man named WILLIAM HOOPER was the only person employed on board the schooner, and he, together with the yawl-boat, have been missing since that time. About 11 o'clock on the night previous to the finding of the schooner in a sinking condition, two young men belonging on board the yacht Zinga discovered a yawl-boat floating down the river, and upon rowing out to it, saw a man in it with his head over one side of the boat, apparently intoxicated. His general appearance answered somewhat to the description of HOOPER, who is a tail, very dark-complexioned man, with black hair, small black whiskers and black eyes. The men at the time supposed him to be a colored man, but could not be positive on account of the darkness. Capt. KELLY's face was considerably eaten away, but several marks were discovered upon the head, and particularly a severe cut was discovered over the left eye.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SUPPOSED MURDER OF ANOTHER CAPTAIN OF A SCHOONER.; The Vessel Sunk and the Hand Employed on Board Missing.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SUPPOSED MURDER OF ANOTHER CAPTAIN OF A SCHOONER.; The Vessel Sunk and the Hand Employed on Board Missing.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea68375a-5a4e-566c-bf67-5d3d5213638d,2002,nyt://article/ea68375a-5a4e-566c-bf67-5d3d5213638d,

The more minute details of these fine little vessels are as follow: The hulls, built by B.C. TERRY, of Keyport, N.J., are of wood, strapped diagonally with heavy iron, within and without the frames; entirely ""copper and galvanized"" fastened, and ceiled with oak planking 3 1/2 inches thick; an arched hogging frame runs from stem to stern; the stems are protected by the best flange boiler-plate, and the vessels are coppered with unusually heavy sheets, to 20 inches above the water-line -- the top sheets, about 4 feet square, weighing 45 1/2 pounds each. The upper rails are also coppered; the bits and caps are of polished brass; the chocks are lined with brass, and the elects on deck are of iron; the main rails around the boats are protected by heavy wrought-iron bands; the upper works and general appointments of the vessels are superior as to workmanship and material.

He has before frequently threatened her with violence unless she returned to live with him, and once he has been bound over to keep the peace towards her. Monday night he sought her at the house of Mrs. MCNEIL, where she was visiting. Forcing himself into her presence be asked her again to live with him. She refused, when he seized her by the hair and drew a bowie-knife across her throat before he could be secured by the other parties present. Fortunately in the excitement of the moment LANDER used the back instead of the sharp edge of the knife, and therefore she was not seriously injured.

They will find there much to interest, either the student of dramatic literature, or the observer of human character. They will find volumes on all subjects connected with the stage; the history of the theatre in every time and country; the lives of the great actors and actresses; anecdotes of GARRICK and memoranda of TALMA; stories about Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE and scandal about RACHEL. Instructions in gesture and declamation; pictures and prints representing pageants of by-gone days; portraits endeavoring to retain the fleeting expression of those mobile faces that now are still forever; accounts of masques in the time of CHARLES I., and mysteries in those days when the priests were the players, and churches the play-houses. They will find the scores of the earliest operas and the music for some of the latest ballets; they will find old plays that were performed before SHAKESPEARE's were written, and others in manuscript that never were performed at all, and never deserved to be. Those who are curious in costume can turn to volumes in nearly every tongue, illustrated by colored engravings of the ancient and modern styles of dress; chivalric customs, the armor of the Greeks and Romans and of the middle ages, heraldry and its insignia, hawking and hunting, archery and the occult sciences, all are discussed and described. Fancy dresses for a ball can be studied; coronations and funerals, processions and royal programmes and parades to welcome modern princes can be gotten up after resorting to these resources. A perfect museum of literature is this left by the great comedian. Odd and ends of antiquity, scraps of queer and quaint information, celebrated speeches of great orators, copies of the proceedings at famous trials, books of jests, classic poems, theatrical criticisms, and, of course, an infinite quantity of dramas, comedies, tragedies, historical, pastoral, scenes indivisible, and poems unlimited.

CHAS. T. RODGERS, Esq., the chairman, called the meeting to order and the Rocky Mountain Glee Club sung a song. Then Hon. JAMES HUMPHREY, M.C. from Brooklyn, addressed the meeting He did not know that at the close of this eventful day, not so decisive as some supposed, yet of great importance, they could compose their minds to listen to a discussion of political principles. He denied that even the success of the Fusion party in Pennsylvania this day would forshadow the result in November. There was a union there merely for State and local affairs. On the other hand, a Republican victory in Pennsylvania now would be the sure presage of Republican success in November. There were no two parties in the country which disliked each other so cordially as the Douglas and Breckinridge parties. It way because they were not divided in principle, but both were struggling for the spoils, that they so hated each other. Mr. HUMPHREY confined himself to the elucidation of this point. He examined, in the first place, the character of the Bell-Everett Party. However respectable that party might be elsewhere, with its ETHERIDGE and HENRY WINTER DAVIS, [applause,] here in New-York it was venal, consisting of officers without an army, who, wandering about with an auctioneer's flag, had finally sold themselves to the party which had most reviled them. They marched under the flag on which was inscribed ""Indifference;"" but their leader, Mr. BELL, had made avowals in past time which placed him virtually on the same platform with Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. Next, Mr. HUMPHREY controverted the one idea of the Breckinridge Party -- that Slavery was the normal condition of the black man and a blessing to him, and that everywhere where there is no statutory enactment to the contrary, the white man may hold the black man in bondage. The Douglas Party, to all intents and purposes, held the same principles. The expressions of Mr. DOUGLAS at the North were ostensible, and not real, and they were made with the design of alluring the unwary to the support of the Pro-Slavery ascendency. Mr. HUMPHREY quoted the language of Mr. DOUGLAS on different occasions, to show, that his (Mr. HUMPHREY's) statement in this regard was correct.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CITY POLITICS.; Young Men's Republican Union.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/10/archives/singular-case-an-alleged-fraudulent-assignment-of-real-estate.html,,"A complaint has recently been lodged before Justice WELSH against LEWIS JOHNSON, a lawyer having an office No. 39 Nassau-street, and CHAS. A. GRIGLETTI, another lawyer, who resides in Jersey City, charging them with having conspired to defraud Mr. J.A. O'REILLY by the transfer of some leasehold property, which the complainant had been in possession of for the past ten years. The circumstances of the case as developed so far, in the testimony before Justice WELSH, are as follows; In June, 1847, Mr. O'REILLY employed Mr. PHILIP BURROWES, a lawyer, to purchase for him from one GARRETT SHUFELDT the lease of two vacant lots, located on Ninth-avenue. The transaction was completed and SHUFELDT made the assignment to CHARLES A. GRIGLETTI, one of the defendants, who at the time was a clerk in BURROWES' employ. The complainant O'REILLY paid the purchase money, and assumed all the responsibilities, and GRIGLETTI, in accordance with the understanding that existed, reassigned the property to him. The papers in the transaction having been sworn to before a Commissioner of Deeds, and being considered perfected, were then deposited in BURROWES' office for safe keeping. O'REILLY subsequently constructed buildings, valued at $10,000, upon the lots in question, and remained in peaceful possession of the property until the 9th of August last. At that time the discovery was made by JOHNSON or some other person that the assignment from SHUFELDT to GRIGLETTI was valid, as it had been recorded, but that the assignment from the latter to O'REILLY, never having been subjected to that formula, was void. GRIGLETTI was apprised of this, and it is alleged that for a small consideration he was induced to make a second assignment of the property to JOHNSON, who forthwith commenced suits of ejectment against O'REILLY's tenants.

The meeting was called to order at 7 1/2 o'clock by JAMES SHARKEY, when Alderman KALBFLEISCH was elected Chairman, and the usual quantity of Vice-Presidents and Secretaries were selected. GILBERT DEAN, Esq., was the first speaker. He commeneed by saying these were times that tried men's souls. Pennsylvania, the keystone of the arch, is shaken -- Ohio and Indiana have gone for the Republican candidates. But we in New-York say to each other that this is the battle-field, and we will signify our devotion to the Union by rolling up an unprecedented majority for the Union ticket. The burthen of his concluding remarks was to show that the Republicans were not capable of, and were too corrupt to govern a State or the country. Hon. JOHN COCHRANE was the next speaker. Mr. COCHRANE said the differences in the State of New-York had been healed, and the Democracy would march in the old step to victory, though Pennsylvania was shaky and Indiana had proved recreant to her trust. He referred to the Douglas nominations for Sheriff and Congress, and closed by declaring that the people of the South were now united as they never were before, and that New-York was certain to defeat Mr. LINCOLN. Senator SPINOLA at this point arrived on the ground at the head of a band of Hickory Boys. He was called for and took the stand, and made a lengthy speech to show that the real contest was whether the white or black man should rule this country.

"-- Capt. Hinckley, commander of the British steam sloop Gladiator, who was recently assaulted in New-Orleans by one of Walker's desperadoes, is a most gallant and intrepid officer. About a year ago, at imminent peril of his own life, he boarded the American brig St. Mary, dismasted and totally disabled during a heavy gale, to see what assistance he could render. The vessel was in a sinking condition, but, through the exertions of Capt. Hinckley and his men, she was safely towed to the harbor of St. Thomas -- a distance of 800 miles. This gallant service was fully recognized, by the New-York Board of Underwriters, and only recently they presented a very handsome testimonial to the Captain, officers and crew of the Gladiator.

Some two years ago, however, human bones were exposed there, and Mayor TIEMANN and Comptroller HAWS had them removed, at an expense of $2,900. It was then believed that but few more remained, and the property subsequently was given or leased at the rate of $1 per year, to the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum and Woman's Hospital, by the Common Council, with the understanding that the corporations of those charities were never to search after the scattered human remains supposed to be left in the ground, but to build upon it as it came into their possession. Very recently, however, it has transpired that the Commissioners of Health -- whose secret sessions are hold semi-weekly or oftener, in the private office of the Mayor -- have been going all over the ground again during the past Summer. Complaint was made to the Mayor last Spring that the old Potter's Field was not properly rid of human remains, and upon this complaint CHAS. WIEGAN, a lager-bier saloon keeper on Fifty-second-street, near Potter's Field, and another man in Yorkville, were ordered to resume the job of removing the bones. WIEGAND was permitted to prepare the boxes for the re-interment of the remains in a decent manner, and was allowed fifty cents the load for taking them to the dock. Comptroller HAWS objected to the work as being unnecessary, but as the Commissioners of Health had the power to cause the expenditure, the bill was paid. The work had been under way a long time, when the Comptroller sent one of his clerks to note particulars of its progress, and he reported that eight or ten laborers were engaged in hunting out the remains.

The papers, contributed mainly by the ablest living scholars, savans and engineers of the Peninsula, manifest evidences not only of profound and earnest scholarship, but also of vigorous, original thought, and judicious speculation, tending powerfully to the advancement of scientific inquiry. Especially interesting are those treating of commercial and industrial questions affecting that most interesting country, At this period of transition, attention is naturally attracted to all the elements necessary to a comparison of the commercial status of the several States under the protective and despotic systems now passing away, and the immediate future of trade and labor to which Freedom will unquestionably afford a new and energetic stimulus. And of much interest, as bearing upon cotemporary history, are several papers upon military questions; those, for instance, of Col. FOGLIARDI, on the ""New Italian Army;"" Dr. AGOSTINO BRETANI, on the ""Cacciatori of the Alps in 1859, their wounds, and their deaths;"" and Signor JACCHI on the ""Mode of completing the Italian Army."" There are also various contributions upon purely literary topics, exhibiting refined and matured taste. As appendants to the monthly issue, works of permanent value are from time to time published, under the charge of the redaction. Of these, the most recent is a map of Italy, illustrative of the mediaeval conflicts between the various communities, with a highly valuable chronological index.

After 11 O' clock in the morning there was but little business done. Buyers and sellers were alike anxious to see the Prince and aid in the demonstration, so many of the stores were closed, and instead of the flaming advertisements which usually embellish the windows and fronts of places of trade, American, English and other flags were hung out, and Broadway, from the Battery to Madison-square, was in holiday dress. Early in the morning the revenue cutter Harriet Lane left her anchorage at the Battery and, with the Committee of Reception, Gen. SCOTT, and a number of guests on board, proceeded to Amboy to receive the Prince and suite. He was there taken on board and conveyed to Castle Garden, where he was again received and welcomed by the Mayor. He then left Castle Garden and reviewed the First Division, which was drawn up in line on the Battery. When the review was over, the Prince and party entered carriages, in waiting for them, and, accompanied by the military, proceeded to the City Hall, in front of which he received a marching salute. The line was then reformed, and the Prince was escorted to his rooms in the Fifth-avenue Hotel. The demonstration was among the very best which has ever been made by the City. During the day there were not less than 200,000 people either looking on or taking active part in the welcome, and yet there was no accident of any moment, nor did anything occur to mar the pleasure of the occasion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Ohio', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-10-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ebe9a6a6-8b13-51b1-91ab-0270985b9bcc,998,nyt://article/ebe9a6a6-8b13-51b1-91ab-0270985b9bcc,

"Mr. JOHN KEEPE, of Williamsburgh, who is employed at the lifting dock located at Pier No. 39 East River, near Pike-street, on reaching his place of business, between 7 and 8 o'clock yesterday morning, found the body of a man floating beneath the pier. He at once called a policeman to assist him in taking the remains from the water; and this having been accomplished, unmistakable evidence was presented that deceased had been the subject of violence, which had resulted in his death. The skull and the upper part of the face were crushed in; the nose had been forced from its position and lay upon the cheek, the eyes were discolored and closed in consequence of contused wounds, and a gash in the throat showed that a sharp instrument -probably an axe -- had been used to inflict it.

He at once called a policeman to assist him in taking the remains from the water; and this having been accomplished, unmistakable evidence was presented that deceased had been the subject of violence, which had resulted in his death. The skull and the upper part of the face were crushed in; the nose had been forced from its position and lay upon the cheek, the eyes were discolored and closed in consequence of contused wounds, and a gash in the throat showed that a sharp instrument -probably an axe -- had been used to inflict it.

"-- Of the much very natural surprise excited by the result of the election in Pennsylvania, a large share must be given to the First Congressional District, where the candidate of the People's party proves upon the official count to have a majority of 180. The District has so long been represented by the highly respectable hatter of that name as to be known as Florence's. It embraces the lower Wards of the city, where the population is largely intermixed with foreign elements, where education is at a discount, and the popular morals find expression in street-fights, and other frequent disorderly manifestations. It is no unusual thing for democratic politics to meet with peculiar acceptance in such localities; and that Mr. FLORENCE has succeeded in procuring his return, from 1852 until his present term can hardly be a matter of astonishment, especially in view of the adroit and capital use made in his behalf of the administration influence in the Navy Yard. The fact, that his triumphs have been exactly coordinate with the predominance of his party at Washington might indeed provoke a suspicion that to this specific source his success in extinguishing Know-Nothingism in his district and in repelling the inroads of Republicanism is to be chiefly ascribed. But the decline of this possible influence is only an incident of the decline of all Administration influence, not only in this one spot, but throughout the North. In the Fall of 1856, floating upon the flood-tide which swept Mr. BUCHANAN into office, Mr. FLORENCE was returned to Congress by a majority of 2,220, over an antagonist who was supported by both opposing parties. In 1858, a new party, created by the Administration impolicy in regard to Kansas, had sprung up, and while FLORENCE had a plurality of 331 over the People's, and nearly 5,000 over the Anti-Lecompton candidate, he was in a minority upon the popular vote of more than 2,000. How enormously this deficit has been increased may, in the absence of detailed returns, be conjectured from the majority now obtained by Mr. BUTLER, the People's candidate, notwithstanding the presence in the field of a third contestant put forward by the Bell and Everett Party, attracting about the same vote as that given in the previous contest for the Anti-Lecompton man.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/13/archives/an-unexpected-victory.html,,"-- Of the much very natural surprise excited by the result of the election in Pennsylvania, a large share must be given to the First Congressional District, where the candidate of the People's party proves upon the official count to have a majority of 180.

"It has been stated, in one or more of the newspapers, that the members of the Committee on Police and Carriages, at the Ball on Friday evening last, believed that a large number of persons not entitled to cards of invitation had gained admission, and they therefore ordered a count of the tickets received at the doors; also, that charges had been made of collusion on the part of the Committee's door-keepers, and the police -- two of the former and one of the latter -- being stationed at each door. Such opinions or charges were not entertained or expressed by the Committee, but from the reliable character of the persons employed to receive the tickets of admission, they most positively dissented from the opinions expressed that the number present exceeded the legitimate issue of cards of invitation, and they ordered the count only as a precaution to prevent the surmises and meet the openly avowed charges of irregularity or collusion on the part of any persons connected with the issue or collection of tickets. At 2 o'clock, by the request of EDWARD PRIME, Esq., and myself, members of the Committee having the charge of the entrances to the house, the boxes of tickets received for admission were taken to a private room and counted by us.

Coroner SCHIRMER yesterday held an inquest upon the body of as Irishman which was found on Friday morning last beneath Pier No. 39, East River. From the fact that the remains were shockingly mutilated the face being crushed in and the skull broken -- it was supposed that the man had been murdered, but from the testimony adduced at the inquest, the jury declared that he had been drowned. JOHN O'BRIEN, keeper of the dead-house at Bellevue Hospital, deposed that the body was identified on Saturday last by one of the boatmen of the Island Hospital, as that of ANDREW MEEHAN. Deceased had been an inmate of the Hospital, and about ten days ago he attempted to escape from the Island by swimming the river. He was not again seen alive. Dr. GEORGE B. BOUTON deposed that he had made a post-mortem examination of the body, and that he had found the nasal bones fractured, and the cartilage broken from its attachments and flattened to the right; on the left side of the nose was an incised wound, three-quarters of an inch long, and another extending from the base of the nose to the left supra orbital notch; an incised and lacerated wound extending two inches from a joint to the right of the symphysis of the lower mascilia at its interior border across the throat. These wounds, in the Doctor's opinion, were all inflicted after death. There were also wounds on the neck and temples, and the brains, lungs and viscera were much congested. Dr. BOUTON added that he had no doubt that death had been caused by drowning. A verdict in accordance with this opinion was rendered. It is probable that the body while floating in the river was struck by the flange of a propeller, or the paddles of a steamer, and that the wounds were given in that way.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e9f88bef-7d93-5995-afc0-b4e75a402e35,1106,nyt://article/e9f88bef-7d93-5995-afc0-b4e75a402e35,

Reaching the corner of Prince-street and Broadway he became involved in a dispute with two strangers, one of whom finally struck him a heavy blow on the head. He fell to the pavement, the blow having rendered him insensible, and his friends as soon as possible had him taken to his residence, where a physician was called to see him. The measures adopted to restore him, however, did not prove successful, and on Sunday evening, at [???] 1/2 o'clock, he died. Coroner SCHIRMER yesterday held an inquest upon the body, and a post-mortem examination by Dr. BOSTON showed that death had resulted from compression of the brain, superinduced by a fracture of the skull.

She left Liverpool on the 6th inst., and Queenstown on the 7th. Two dispatches from Naples are published one vid Genoa and the other via Turin stating that GARIBALDI had gained another important success over the Ex-King's troops. An attack, it seems, was made upon the position of the Dictator at Caserta, but the King's forces were repulsed and surrounded, and finally lost two thousand men, taken prisoners. No particulars are given, and the news requires confirmation; but its truth is rendered more probable by the fact that it comes in two different directions. A report was also current that GARIBALDI had invited VICTOR EMANUEL to assume authority in Naples, when he would retire to his home. A summary of the Pope's allocution had been published. He condemns, of course, in the strongest terms, the ""detestable"" and ""sacrilegious"" attack of the King of Sardinia, and protests fervently against the doctrine of non-intervention, as promulgated by the Emperor of the French and other Catholic sovereigns. VICTOR EMANUEL had issued an address of thanks to his army at Ancona, and had promised to take the command in person. The Spanish Government had demanded a Congress of the Catholic Powers, with a view to guaranteeing the integrity of the States of the Church; but the French Cabinet, while admitting its expediency, declared that the matter of territorial changes could come properly only before a European Congress.

"-- We understand that Commodore VANDERBILT is about to build two fast passenger steamers for his transatlantic line. They are to be constructed of wood and braced in the most subtantial manner. Their length is to be 400 feet, beam 55 feet and depth only 17 to 18 feet. There will be no solid bulwarks of the ordinary kind, but the decks will be as thick and solid as the bottom of the ship, and the deck-houses -- instead of being light panel work -- will be constructed like the sides of a ship, with bull's eye lights. These structures will also be sharp, like a ship's bow, to divide the water. The deck and the structures upon it will thus form the upper web of a girder, and will give the vessel great stiffness. The ships will have two beam engines like the Vanderbilt's, with 100-inch cylinders by 16 feet stroke. The paddle-wheels will be 60 feet in diameter by 12 feet bucket. This construction of engine is in accordance with the best practice on the North River, as well as the successful experience of Commodore VANDERBILT's ocean ships. We wish the Commodore would inaugurate a more trustworthy method of constructing iron ships, and then use the best material; both he and the public would be better satisfied in the long run.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/17/archives/fast-transatlantic-steamers.html,,"-- We understand that Commodore VANDERBILT is about to build two fast passenger steamers for his transatlantic line.

On the day previous, apparently in good health, she had been seen in the company of Mr. EDMON BLANKMAN, a lawyer of this City, to whom she is said to have been married about two years ago, and together they had witnessed the procession in honor of the Prince of Wales, from a window of Bixby's Hotel, at the corner of Broadway and Tenth-street. The suddenness of her demise therefore occasioned a suspicion on the part of her relatives that she had been poisoned, and the suspicion was not confined to the immediate circle of her acquaintances, but was expressed by many who had been intimate with her when, as proprietress of an elegant house of prostitution in Mercer-street, she attracted to her saloons some who have since become famous in politics and at the bar. That the matter might be satisfactorily determined, Dr. FINNELL, a surgeon of large experience in the conduct of postmortem cases, and Dr. SANDS, Demonstrator of Anatomy at the Twenty-third-street Medical College, were engaged by the brother of deceased to make an autopsy. This was accomplished on Sunday morning last, but it was by no means of a thorough character. Dr. FINNELL confined his investigation to the head, making a particular examination of the brain, while Dr. SANDS pursued his search no further than the thorax, leaving the stomach, intestines, lungs and other organs undisturbed. The medical gentlemen having concluded their operatives, made out a certificate, which, however, was only signed by Dr. SANDS, that Mrs. BLANKMAN had died of apoplexy; and in the afternoon of the same day the remains were interred at Greenwood Cemetery. The fact that a post-mortem examination had been made did not, however, publicly transpire until yesterday, and within a few days the rumor that the woman's death was the result of other than a natural cause, became so general that the authorities were finally induced to take cognizance of it. The matter was brought to the attention of Coroner SC[???]ER on Saturday last by means of an anonymous communication, which was thrust beneath the door-sill of his residence in West Tenth-street, stating that there were circumstances attending Mrs. BLANKMAN's death which demanded a thorough investigation. He, however, declined to notice this unofficial information, believing it to have emanated from some enemy of Mr. BLANKMAN, who had the gratification of his revenge in view. Yesterday morning the Coroner called upon District-Attorney WATERBURY for advice as to his proper course in the present aspect of the case, and an exhumation of the body was determined upon. An order was accordingly made out authorizing Mr. WARD, an undertaker, doing business in Pearl-street, to disinter the remains, which was done, and they were conveyed to Bellevue Hospital. To-day it is the intention of Dr. BOUTON, the Coroner's Deputy, to make a very careful examination, in which he will be assisted by several eminent medical gentlemen, and in this way it is hoped that the suspicions connected with the affair will be removed.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""SUDDEN DEATH OF A NOTORIOUS WOMAN.; Exhumation of her Remains for the Purposes of a Coroner's Inquest."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""SUDDEN DEATH OF A NOTORIOUS WOMAN.; Exhumation of her Remains for the Purposes of a Coroner's Inquest."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6f135e6c-91d1-56ec-b962-b309f6002e76,792,nyt://article/6f135e6c-91d1-56ec-b962-b309f6002e76,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/18/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"BOARD OF SUPERVISORS INTEREST ON WATER BONDS. An objourned meeting of the Kinds County Board of Supervisors, was held last evening. The first subject of interest which came up for consideration, was a report of the Committee on General and Local Taxes on communications from the Boards of Water and Sewer Commissioners. The Water Commissioners say they have ascertained that the net income of the Water Works, after paying the annual expenses, will be insufficient by the sum of $60,000 to pay interest for the coming year on the bonds issued for the construction of the Water Works, and therefore ask that the deficiency be inserted in the tax list. The Sewers Commissioners ask $25,000 for anticipated repairs on sewers -- making a total of $85,000. The Committee report against raising the money asked for because the requisitions are founded upon ""anticipated expenses"" in the repairs of sewers, and ""anticipated"" deficiency in the receipts in the Water Commissioners' Department of Water Taxes to pay interest, and not upon any expense or deficiency of receipts actually occurred, and should any deficiency exist, the act has a provision for raising the money. A motion to amend the report by directing the amount to be inserted in the taxes, was lost by a vote of 5 Ayes to 16 Noes. The report was adopted by a vote of 18 to 3. It was stated during the discussion of this matter that the receipts of the Water department up to the present time amounted to about $400,000, and that 140 miles of pipe had been laid. Supervisor CROOK, of the Committee to inquire as to what disposition the Excise Commissioners had made of the money received by them during the last year, reported that the money -- about $13,000 -- was in the Central Bank to the credit of the Commissioners. That Commissioner MURPHY was ready to sign a check at any time for the amount, but one of his associates entertained an opinion that the Supervisors had nothing to do with the money, and would not sign the check until the spirit moved him. A resolution was adopted directing the County Treasurer to obtain the money. F.S. STALLKENCHT complained to the Board that he had been compelled to pay a fee of $6 for the privilege of bailing a boy who was locked up in jail awaiting trial. The matter was referred to the Law Committee to investigate. The question as to selecting a site for the proposed County Courthouse was laid over till Nov. 7, to which time the Board adjourned.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e98e2a7a-e02f-5250-a80c-41b775f6052c,711,nyt://article/e98e2a7a-e02f-5250-a80c-41b775f6052c,

The family of its owner being about to spend several years in Europe, the whole contents of the mansion, comprising over 100 paintings, a large collection of statuary, curiosities, and articles of vertu without number -- the accumulated treasures of years of lavish expenditure -- have been remorselessly surrendered to the great Toodles public, and, together with the upholstery of the establishment, knocked off to the highest bidder. The auction commenced on Wednesday with the sale of the paintings, of which there were 117 pieces. The attendance was not large, being confined principally to connoisseurs, who regulated their bids so as not to permit any very fearful sacrifice of the Old Masters. Among the chief bidders were MARLEY, the dealer; Mr. NIBLO and Dr. PETERS. ""The Magdalen,"" a fine picture, pronounced by the catalogue to be an ""original,"" from CORREGGIO, was knocked off to MARLEY at $1,025, and was the highest on the list.

"The opening of the past week gave little prospect for the yet outstanding corn. Monday night's tempest has been followed by heavy rains, and there seems little hope that the remainder of the grain, if sound, will be in fair condition. Some quantity of wheat even in the south and midland counties remains to be carried, and the bulk of all grain is yet jeopardized in the north, though Scotland is better off. Ireland, too, is in great peril, with much to be gathered. The agricultural districts of that country show a decrease in the growth of cereals this season of 15,223 acres, which, as this consists of Spring corn, taken at six, while the growth of potatoes is 28,510 acres less. This consideration upon the diseased state of the crop, which extends over 1,171,837 acres shows a heavy void to be filled up, supposing Great Britain is sad to hear that heavy rains in Southern Europe are beginning to threaten this important grain, which keeps continually advancing. With such weather, the markets here could not fail to rise, the average of the week being about 3s. per qr. There has been an unusual demand for dry foreign red of low quality to help off our own damp new by mixture; and as our own stock of old is nearly used up, it seems doubtful whether we shall have enough old foreign to meet our necessities. Throughout the continent very little is left, and much is waited here, while American is quite exhausted, and the shipments lately made are nearly all new, with condition of some not well reported. Prices there have moderately given way, as they have in Spain and Italy and on the Danube, but there has been some reaction at Odessa, as well as in Northern Germany, the Baltic, Holland, Belgium and France. It may be well, in our estimation of the possible shipments of the United States, to remember that for the last fourteen years the largest shipments thence were in 1846 and 1847, when, with an accumulation of old corn, they reached to 17,157,659 bushels of wheat and 3,156,245 barrels of flour, equal to 3,700,000 qrs.; but this season they had little to begin with.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/19/archives/the-harvest-in-great-britain.html,,"The opening of the past week gave little prospect for the yet outstanding corn.

The damage to the stock of Mr. PARDESSUS is said to be $15,000. He had effected a full insurance upon it in the Excelsior, Lafayette Harmony and Stuyvesant Insurance Companies. The flames extended to that part of the adjoining building, No. 34 Platt-street, occupied by E. MULLER, porcelain dealer, and by the Sullivan Blacking Company. The former suffered a loss of $1,000, insured for $3,000 in City Companies, but only slight injury resulted to the stock of the Blacking Company, who are insured for $2,000 in the Home Insurance Company.

"A MAN CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO MURDER HIS WIFE. -- About 1 1/2 o'clock yesterday (Friday) morning, as Officers VALADE and CARROLL were standing at the corner of Sussex and Essex streets, Jersey City, they heard the quick and repeated cries of ""Watch,"" at a house near by in Essex-street. Upon entering the rear basement room they found a man named THOMAS KELLY, armed with a large carving-knife, and apparently very much excited, while his wife was sitting in a chair exhausted, and her night  clothes covered with blood, which was flowing profusely from a number of severe wounds about the head and face. KELLY was disarmed and conveyed to the Station-house, where he was locked up. It appears that KELLY had been spending the evening with a party of friends, drinking and carousing. About 12 o'clock at night Mrs. KELLY went after and endeavored to pursuade her husband to return home, but he refused to leave, and she accordingly went home alone. About an hour afterwards KELLY came in, and a quarrel occurred between them. Finally, becoming enraged, he dragged her from the bed, and seizing a heavy boot beat her in a most brutal manner over the head with the heel of it. The first blow stunned her, but soon after, recovering a little, she begged of her husband not to kill her, when he replied, ""Yes, I will."" The timely arrival of the officers probably saved the woman's life, as he had armed himself as above stated, and apparently intended to carry his threat into execution. Dr. QUIDOR, City Physician, was called in and pronounced the injuries of a dangerous nature. Mrs. KELLY was removed to the Hospital, and Recorder TILDEN committed the accused to the County Jail to await the result of the injuries.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/20/archives/newjersey.html,,"A MAN CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO MURDER HIS WIFE. -- About 1 1/2 o'clock yesterday (Friday) morning, as Officers VALADE and CARROLL were standing at the corner of Sussex and Essex streets, Jersey City, they heard the quick and repeated cries of ""Watch,"" at a house near by in Essex-street.

The rush of crinoline and broadcloth that pervaded the parlors,_the anterooms, the halls, the boudoirs, the saloons, and the various apartments, large and small, that opened to view in that princely establishment, was scarcely equaled by the grand crush in honor of Baron RENREW at the Academy of Music. As the Baron on that occasion was the ""cynosure of all eyes,"" so was Mr. EDWARD SCHENCK, the auctioneer, on this. Fair bidders thronged around him, with anxiety in their faces and porte-monnaies in their hands; followed him to this room and to that, and were only too happy if, after the last ""going,"" ""going,"" ""gone,"" they heard the announcement -- ""Sold to Mrs. _____"" Mr. SHENCK, it must be allowed, deported himself like a true ""prince of the blood,"" and dispensed ""bargains"" with a rapidity and profusion only equaled by the liberality of his Royal prototype. The sale was admirably conducted and with a dispatch rarely equaled. Nearly $10,000 worth of furniture was disposed of between 10 and 2 o'clock. The following are some of the ""bargains"" secured, not a few of which, it may be safely asserted, were as much a bargain to the seller as to the buyer: Suite of ancient Milan steel armor, $335; black marble mantle-clock, mounted by a group of bronze, $205; six black walnut chairs, Paris make, $120; four carved oak bookcases, $140; four sets brocatel door curtains, $136; one set centre curtains, $100; set of ebony chairs and sofas, fourteen pieces, $300; one ebony, bronze and ormolu side meuble, $340; four French plate mirrors, $135, $125, $145 and $140; pair of equestrian bronze groups, $270; two sevres blue porcelain and ormolu vases, $160; suite of Bois deRose and ormolu furniture covered in gobelin tapestry, four chairs and a sofa, $200; two Bois deRose, ormolu and antique sevres cabinets, $320; bronze and ormolu fire irons, $102; pair of Dresden statuettes, $100; magnificent bronze; and marble clock, $185, and other articles without number at prices to match.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/22/archives/police-reports-thieves-and-a-courageous-domestic-various-stabbing-a.html,,"Rogues are prolific in devices wherewith to accomplish their dishonest plans. On Tuesday night last one of the fraternity named Thomas Devoy alias Watson, called at the basement door of the residence of Mr. George Kenny, No. 119 Second-avenue, and asked to see Maria Reardon, the servant girl, stating that he had a letter for her which required an answer. He was ushered by the wondering damsel into the back kitchen, where, being unable to read herself, she invited her visitor to decipher the epistle. To do this was just what he desired, as he left the door unsecured that a confederate might enter and plunder the house, while he engaged her attention. The noise made by rogue No. 2 in prosecuting his search of the beaufet excited the young woman's suspicions, and, in spite of Devoy's efforts to prevent her, she got into the front basement in time to see the thief ""bag"" a lot of silver-ware and run out of the door. She pursued him and seized him by the leg as he was passing through the area gate, and he endeavored to make her release her hold by striking her a heavy blow in the face with his bag of silver-ware. He did not succeed in this, however, and he only escaped by slipping out of his coat, the collar of which garment Maria had meantime tenaciously grasped. The other rogue came up while the contest was raging, and also attempted to run past the girl into the street. This, like his confederate, he succeeded in doing, leaving his coat as a trophy in the hands of the courageous young woman, who, having gathered the spoils, including the bag of silver-ware, straightway went to the office of the Detective Police, and gave a description of the thieves. On Saturday night Detectives Farley and Slowey effected the arrest of both the accused -- the name of Devoy's companion in the robbery being William Beatty alias Thompson. Yesterday the prisoners were taken before Justice QUACKENBUSH, who committed them for trial.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; THIEVES AND A COURAGEOUS DOMESTIC.

After having partaken of refreshments, one of the men challenged his companion to a wrestling match, and the gauntlet was accepted. A scuffle of some moments' duration resulted in MCKENNA's fall, with considerable violence, to the floor, and his defeat irritated him so much that he made an attempt to gouge out an eye of his opponent. The bystanders, however, prevented further violent demonstrations, and the proprietor of the saloon insisted that both men should go away from his place, and this they finally did. Presently, however, DONOHUE came back, and, after the lapse of a short interval, MCKENNA also returned. He immediately went towards DONOHUE, remarking that it was foolish to indulge in feelings of animosity for so trivial a cause; that he was wrong in giving way to his temper, and he desired to make up and be friends again. While making these professions, however, he was possessed with the purpose of an assassin, for as soon as he had approached near enough to reach DONOHUE, he pulled a knife from beneath his coat-sleeve and made a lunge at his throat. The blade entered the neck of the unsuspecting man, who fell bleeding profusely from the wound. His assailant immediately made his way towards a side door, brandishing his weapon, and threatening to murder any person who attempted to prevent his escape. DONOHUE was taken by the witnesses of the assault to a neighboring drug store, where his wound was staunched, and afterwards he was removed to his residence. The police of the Ninth Precinct were notified of the occurrence, and a pursuit for MCKENNA was at once entered upon, but so far it has not resulted in his arrest. It subsequently transpired that during the time MCKENNA was absent from the porter-house, he had gone into a grocery store near by and stolen the knife with which he attempted the assassination of his victim.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Almost an Assassination.; A MAN'S THROAT CUT IN A PORTER-HOUSE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Almost an Assassination.; A MAN'S THROAT CUT IN A PORTER-HOUSE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b3e10744-ecc6-50ef-9602-0adfd2bee62d,363,nyt://article/b3e10744-ecc6-50ef-9602-0adfd2bee62d,

We feel warranted in this assumption by the fact that the leading politicians of the Northern Slave States have taken decided ground in favor of adhering to the Union until ""an overt act"" of invading Southern rights is committed by a Republican President. There is nothing in this position inconsistent with the sincerest devotion to the Union; for who will be so unreasonable, and so faithless to the principles of Republican liberty, as to maintain that the States must submit to the overthrow of their constitutional rights by the Federal Government? It is true that men may differ as to what will be ""an overt act"" of invasion, but an agreement in advance to remain in the Union until the Federal Government transcends its constitutional power, is all that any fair-minded Republican could ask of the South or the North. Whether peaceful secession, or simple revolution, be the ""rightful remedy"" of the States, is a question involving constitutional niceties which we will not now attempt to settle; but certainly no sound Republican will maintain that the States must remain passive while their local sovereignty is being overthrown, and the Confederacy converted into a consolidated despotism.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Disunion How it will Work', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Disunion How it will Work', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Stocks and Bonds', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf0a7670-42c1-54cd-a8a5-178af5dd3758,1441,nyt://article/cf0a7670-42c1-54cd-a8a5-178af5dd3758,

As the Grand Lodge entered, Dodworth's Band, which in full force was stationed on the platform, performed a grand march. The members of the Lodge, who were clad in their regalias, took seats on the platform where already were stationed the choir of the Cooper Union ranged near one of CHICKERING's grand pianos.

"The French Theatre in Broadway was last night filled with a cordial and good-natured audience assembled to surrender up their senses to a fair enchantress. To the ""natural magic"" of a graceful person, bright eyes, and an eloquent smile, Mlle. VICTORIA, the ""Queen of Black Arts,"" unites all the skill in artificial witchcraft which ROBERT HOUDIN could communicate to an apt pupil. The programme of Mile. VICTORIA was full of the most agreeable tours de force, which were executed with a pretty ease and received with hearty applause.

"-- Our Havana correspondent transmits information that proves how utterly futile are the attempts to extinguish the Slave trade under the present regulations. Though a large American, English, and Spanish fleet is keeping constant watch upon the movements of the traders, and the Captain-General has undertaken in earnest to punish the Spanish authorities in Cuba who connive at the traffic, yet it flourishes more than ever. It is estimated that, during nine months of the current year, 30,000 Africans have been landed on the Island and even steamships are now engaged in the prosecution of the business. Every year more capital and more energy are employed in the Slave-trade, and the more vessels that are captured the more would seem to be started on this barbarous and inhuman venture. Our correspondent affirms that the names of highly respectable merchants, both in the United States and in Europe, are mentioned in connection with the Cuban Slave-trade, and he presents such a picture of its prosperous condition as to make the philanthropist despair of ever seeing it abandoned. It certainly never will be abandoned as long as its control remains with the Spanish Government. If Spain ever had any serious determination to enforce her own laws against the Slave-trade it would not now be the blot on her civilization that it is. Experience has proved that a blockade of the Coast of Africa is an impossibility, and as English or American cruisers cannot follow slavers into Spanish waters, their presence in the vicinity of Cuba and Porto Rico is almost useless. The only means by which the Slave-trade can be arrested has been often pointed out. A rigorous and faithful execution of the laws against the Slave-trade in the Island of Cuba would soon render its prosecution impossible; but Spain shirks this responsibility, and will never carry out measures that may check the prosperity of her dependency unless compelled to do so by more powerful reasoning than the moral suasion of England or the United States.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/23/archives/the-slave-trade.html,,"-- Our Havana correspondent transmits information that proves how utterly futile are the attempts to extinguish the Slave trade under the present regulations.

The flames were first seen issuing from the furniture-store, No. 605 Sixth-avenue, situated in the centre of the block, and occupied by GEORGE KARNER. Notwithstanding the fact that the firemen soon commenced operations, the fire could not be checked, and the buildings on either side were quickly in a blaze, while in less than half-an-hour after the discovery of the flames the whole of the middle part of the block, extending through from Sixth-avenue to Broadway, was burned down. It was only through the extraordinary exertions of the firemen that the tenements fronting on Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth streets were saved, and thus a great deal of misery spared the poor people who live in them. As it was, however, more than twenty poor families were rendered homeless, and in some instances penniless, having had barely time enough to leave their beds and escape in their night-clothes, the fire sweeping along so rapidly. The entire loss will probably not exceed $10,000, the buildings being considered of comparatively little value. They were erected by Mr. D.F. MAURICE soon after the opening of the Crystal Palace, and soon afterwards leased to Mr. SAMUEL P. TOWNSEND, who has since retained control of them. It is probable that the owner will now raze what remains of the block, and erect on the site of the present structures houses which will prove better paying property.

DUNSHEE, Esq., in the Chair, and Mr. S.M. PERKINS Secretary. Mr. JOHN H. FANNING, Principal of Ward School No. 12, read a paper on ""Our City School System its History and Utility."" He commenced with the formation of the free-school system in this City, under DEWITT CLINTON, in 1805, and traced its progress, under different corporate names, down to the present time. The ""Free School Society"" had the control of educational matters to the year 1826, at which time its title was changed to the ""Public School Society."" Previous to the year 1830 such parents as were able to pay for the tuition of their children did so, but, as the number of those paying became ""small by degrees and beautifully less,"" the receiving of pay was soon entirely abolished by the Society. In furnishing gratuitous education to all classes of children in our City, and in firmly laying the foundations of our present school system, he considered the Public School Society as justly entitled to the appellation of the ""Pioneer"" Society. He commended it for its integrity and general faithfulness in the discharge of its responsible duties; alluded to the fact that it was the founder of our City Normal Schools; remarked that thousands of our citizens can point to its schools as one points to his Alma Mater; and that nearly half of the present Principals of our large schools obtained the basis of their education or professional training in its schools. Still that Society had its faults, but as a general thing they were on the right side, so to speak. After giving a sketch of the method of discipline and course of instruction prevailing under the old system, he next adverted to the more popular establishment of the ""Board of Education,"" and of local Ward Boards, in 1842. From this time till 1853, two parallel systems of schools -- the Public and the Ward Schools were in existence; but the Board of Education had the supervisory control of both. A new impetus was now given to public education. New school-houses sprung up, as if by magic, and were as rapidly filled with youthful seekers after knowledge, and about this time the Free Academy was ushered into existence. For a time the Public and Ward schools moved onward in a spirit of healthful rivalry; but the necessity of two systems began to be questioned, and the Public School Society voluntarily terminated its labors in 1853. At that time the Public and Ward Schools were merged into one system -- the system of to-day. Our school system is now in the hands of local Ward Boards and of the Board of Education -- men fresh from the ranks of the people, and understanding their wants. In conclusion, Mr. FANNING showed that the Common School system of our City has now a strong hold of the public mind, possesses great vitality, and that, if properly administered, its prospective influence for good is almost unbounded. Mr. WM.J. KENNARD also read a brief paper on ""Errors in Teaching."" Both of the papers elicited remarks from several of the teachers present, after which the Association adjourned, to meet the 14th of next month, at which time a lecture is expected from Rev.

The plaintiffs claimed damages, and to ascertain such damages, a reference to H.W. Robinson, Esq., was ordered. Upon the examination before the Referee, Joseph Burnett, one of the plaintiffs, was called as a witness in his own behalf, and endeavored to show a diminution of the sales of this article, and a consequent loss of profits. That the plaintiffs' profits were $1 40 per dozen bottles ""Cocoaine"" sold by them. Upon his cross-examination the witness stated that he got at the profits by estimating the cost of the materials, bottles, labor, &c., and deducting such gross amount from the sum realized upon a sale of the article. The witness was then asked what materials he calculated the costs upon? The witness refused to answer this question on the ground that it compelled him to divulge the component parts of which ""Cocoaine"" was made, which was a secret of considerable value to his firm. The Referee decided that the question was a proper one and required the witness to answer. And upon his refusal so to do, and as a penalty for such contempt, struck out so much of the plaintiff's claim for damages as was predicated upon a loss of profits upon sales made by them, and, after hearing further proofs, the Referee made his report, granting the plaintiff 6 cents damages. The plaintiff excepted to the report, and, upon argument, at Special Term, before Justice Pierrepont, the case was remanded to the Referee, the Justice allowing two exceptions made, that the Referee erred in deciding the plaintiff not bound to answer the question put to him, and also the exercise of the right of punishment for contempt in refusing to answer the question. From this decision the defendants appealed to the General Term, and in an elaborate opinion by Justice Hoffman, the Court held that the question put to the plaintiff was pertinent, and that he was bound to answer it, as the plaintiff sought to establish his claim by proving his loss of profits. That in such cases there was no exemption nor privilege allowed the witness, and in this respect the Referee was right in his decision. That the practice in such cases was to strike out the whole evidence of the witness for the refusal to answer a proper question, or upon the certificate of the Referee to apply to the Court to punish the witness if the party desired the evidence, and not for the Referee to strike out the plaintiff's claim for damages. The order made at Special Term, which allowed the exception to the punishment imposed by the Referee, was affirmed, but in other respects the order was reversed, without costs.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The ""Cocoaine"" Trade-mark Case.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/24/archives/at-the-newyork-hotel.html,,"The crowd in the vicinity of the New-York Hotel was more dense than in any other part of Broadway,-- partly on account of its location opposite the headquarters of the Republican Campaign Club, and partly from the fact that a rumor had gained circulation that an attack was contemplated upon the aforesaid headquarters by some of the roughs of the Empire Club. No such attack, however, was made, or attempted. Nevertheless, an unusual display of policemen was made at this point, who, not having occasion to be useful were regarded as ornamental. The rooms of the Campaign Clubs were lighted up, and their outside transparency brilliantly illuminated in the forepart of the evening, but long before the procession arrived, the lights were all extinguished, the doors closed, and the banner which hangs across the street hauled in. This proceeding was strenuously opposed by some members of the Club, who regarded it as a cowardly relinquishment of their rights, but on the advice of the General Superintendent of Police, who visited the rooms about 8 o'clock, it was finally acquiesced in as being a measure which the Republicans could amply afford in view of the victory which awaits them, and as being the easiest and cheapest way to prevent the possibility of a disturbance. The crowd on the New-York Hotel side indulged in a variety of taunting insinuations about the courage of the Lincolnites, when they saw their flag hauled in and their rooms darkened, but the Republicans pocketed the insults and preserved the peace. Every window of the hotel, from the sidewalk to the cornice, was filled with the fair faces of the lady inmates, who vied with each other in the enthusiasm of their greetings to the various clubs as they passed under the windows. The head of the procession, with its cavalcade, led by the redoubtable Capt. RYNDERS, mounted on a swift charger, arrived in front of the hotel at precisely 9 1/2 o'clock, and was received with the most enthusiastic cheering and the waving of innumerable handkerchiefs. Capt. RYNDERS acknowledged the honor by ordering a halt, and proposing three cheers for the ""New-York Hotel,"" three for the ""Union,"" and three for the success of the Fusion ticket. They were all given with a will, and the crowd on the walk added three supplementary groans for the Republican Central Campaign Club opposite. Each club, as it passed, received a similar greeting, though not quite so boisterous, and every transparency or device, deserving, from its originality or comicality, any special notice, received its due meed of applause. It was the unanimous opinion of all the Hotel people, that the procession far exceeded, in every respect, the Wide-Awake display, and not a few, in the height of their enthusiasm, declared it as their opinion, that Old ABE LINCOLN was, then and there, and forever hereafter, ""sent higher than a kite."" The Republicans themselves, when appealed to in the comparisons that were constantly being made, admitted that the procession was more varied in its character than that of the Wide-Awakes; that it had more horses, more transparencies, and more mottoes, (many of the latter, however, they considered vulgar,) and that altogether it was a great demonstration. But as to numbers, they could tell better when it had all passed. There was one point that the Republicans claimed beyond cavil, and that was that their procession was made up of more genteel looking men. This point was bluffly knocked in the head, however, by a burly Democrat, who declared that ""it wasn't genteel lookin' men who did the votin' in this 'ere country; the old Whig Party allers thought that and they found theirselves mistaken.""",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AT THE NEW-YORK HOTEL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AT THE NEW-YORK HOTEL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b7e42932-7fd2-5f28-a27c-1a7ab0f1eb3b,636,nyt://article/b7e42932-7fd2-5f28-a27c-1a7ab0f1eb3b,

At this hour there was no crowd below Canal-street to impede locomotion. At this point, however, the sidewalks began to be filled by spectators, who had evidently taken their positions for the evening. The ""Minute Men"" were favorably greeted as they passed along. From Canal-street to the St. Nicholas Hotel Broadway was well filled by 7 3/2 o'clock, every available spot being occupied, both in the street and at the windows, from which a view of the procession could be obtained. The balcony of the St. Nicholas, as well as all the windows, were closely packed mostly by ladies, while crowds of sympathizers blocked up the entrance to the hotel, and rendered ingress and egress quite difficult. Despite this blockade, however, the multitude thronged the large bar-room in the rear almost to suffocation. The more determined clung to their uncertain foothold about the pillars of the doorway, or clambered upon the window sills and other elevated places, in order to see the procession over intervening heads. On the opposite side the Union Democratic Head-quarters were brilliantly lighted up, their transparency, having upon it two clasped hands, showing to good advantage. Here also most of the windows were filled with ladies, with kerchiefs in hand prepared to do all possible honor to the procession when it should begin to move. At 9 o'clock Grand Marshal RYNDERS, at the head of the column, and supported by some twenty mounted men; passed the hotel. His appearance was the signal for a moderate burst of applause from the spectators, in response to which the Marshal raised his hat and bowed his thanks to the applauding multitude. The crowd about the door of the St. Nicholas, though evidently in full sympathy with the demonstration, manifested very little enthusiasm. The cheering generally began and ended in the passing ranks, with an occasional response from the. lookers on. The only exception to this was when the delegations from Jersey City, Newark, Perth Amboy and New-Brunswick passed. These delegations made a fine appearance, and elicited marked applause, which was manifested by clapping of hands and cheering from all sides, while the ladies enthusiastically waved their white handkerchiefs from the windows. The St. Nicholas appeared to be especially favored by the discharge of an extra quantity of fire-works and other demonstrations. The six-pounder which was carried in the procession was fired in front of the hotel, with a stunning report, which broke the windows, and brought a shower of shattered glass upon the heads of the people beneath.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AT THE ST.

CLEOPATRA herself, disinterred in the shape of a monotonous mummy, would hardly charm the most imaginative of antiquarians; but the ""Danae"" of WERTMULLER has flashed out upon New-York after forty years of seclusion in the cabinet of a jealous virtuoso at Philadelphia, as fresh and bright and irresistible a vision of loveliness as she was when she turned the heads of our respectable grandfathers in the days before Waterloo. The name of WERTMULLER is an artistic tradition in America. Born a Swede, and bred a Frenchman, this exiled court-painter of LOUIS XVI, is chiefly known to us by his not very edifying or inspiring portrait of WASHINGTON. This portrait is a popular household image of the Father of his Country, but it conveys to the aesthetic student the very faintest notion of the artistic ability of the painter. To pass from the contemplation of this rigid, estimable, but rather dreary figure of a stately citizen to the glaring beauty and delicate fascination of the same artist's ""Danae,"" is hardly less of a surprise than it would be to take a quiet supper with Lord JOHN RUSSELL, and find TITIAN's ""Venus"" presiding at the teapot.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Artistic Matters.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Artistic Matters.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/204056b3-1365-5486-9c8e-17087549ffd0,443,nyt://article/204056b3-1365-5486-9c8e-17087549ffd0,

It may be remembered that his conclusions went to show decisively that no assimilation of the free nitrogen of the atmosphere takes place. This result is confirmed by a recent communication to the Chemical News, (""On the Sources of the Nitrogen of Plants,"") by Dr. CHARLES CAMERON, who is satisfied from numerous carefully conducted experiments, that neither the gaseous nitrogen of the atmosphere nor the combined nitrogen of humus can be assimilated by plants and that the nutriment of plants can only be supplied by substances of a purely inorganic nature. In addition to the list of substances capable of furnisning nitrogen to plants (as urea, soda, cyanurates of potash, etc.,) he is, from some new experiments, able to add two, viz.: nitrate of potash and ferrocyanide of potash.

Mr. NESMITH is an adherent of Popular Sovereignty, and of the fortunes of Mr. DOUGLAS; Col. BAKER is represented as being favorable to the opinions of Mr. ELI THAYER, regarding the political efficacy of colonization as the antagonist of Slavery; and, therefore, agrees with so much of his colleague's platform as denies the necessity of Congressional intervention for the discomfiture of servile labor. Evidently, therefore, Oregon has turned its back upon the Administration. None of the several phases of persuasion to which Mr. BUCHANAN has in turn addicted himself finds favor with these sturdy settlers of the Northwest; who, in deserting LANE after his ten years of diligent service as delegate and Senator, sufficiently indicate that the fatal fault lies in his recent and obtrusive devotion to the interests of the Slavery propagandists.

The Sardinian troops had entered Neapolitan territory, and several of the Great Powers had protested against the step. The Pope, according to the latest accounts, remained at Rome. A number of places around the Eternal City had been occupied by French troops, and the statement that an additional division would be sent from France indicates that the Emperor is determined to protect the Holy Father from his Sardinian or Garibaldian enemies.

Scarcely had their footsteps become inaudible, as they went their watery way, before the eldest son of our beloved BUCHANAN's ""good friend"" crossed our threshold, and to him we extended the friendly hand of greeting. Mindful of his morals and of the mild request of his most excellent mother, we preserved him from contact with BOOLE and from association with FARLEY. We threw open the doors of our ball-rooms to him as Prince of the Dance, and hailed him in Trinity as Lord of the Aisles. On our Atlantic threshold we bade him a hearty God-speed, and now his waving plume, with its Bohemian legend, is dancing over the waves.

It may be shown with equal clearness, that nearly all of the States had already abolished the slave-trade, and that this fact was strongly pressed upon the attention of the Convention, by way of inducing the majority to yield their objections to the clause providing for the toleration of the traffic for a brief period. All the Northern States together with Maryland and Virginia had irrevocably abolished the slave-trade long before the Convention met. North Carolina imposed a tax of five pounds per head upon Africans imported directly, and ten pounds if brought in from other States. The Legislature of South Carolina, the year before the Convention met, passed an act prohibiting the importation of Slaves for one year, and renewed it for three years. Indeed this prohibition was continued for fifteen years, and the State denied herself the real or supposed advantages of the traffic in slaves for more than three-fourths of the period of twenty years during which Congress was withheld from its final abolition.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Yancey's Historical Inaccuracies Again."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Yancey's Historical Inaccuracies Again."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7b3bd32-82e6-541d-97da-1ac28d9fc08d,1329,nyt://article/d7b3bd32-82e6-541d-97da-1ac28d9fc08d,

After the excursionists had reached Fifty-ninth-street in the cars, on their way back to the City, and while forming into company to march down town, CLARE, it is said, ran behind Mr. WM.H. WARD, one of the spectators, and felled him to the ground by a blow on the head with the butt of his musket, supposing at the time that he was attacking MCCOMB. CLARE was immediately arrested by the Nineteenth Ward Police, and subsequently discharged, as Mr. WARD refused to make a complaint against him, Yesterday, however, the condition of the injured man became so critical from the effects of his wound that CLARE was rearrested, and held to await the result of the violence he had inflicted.

This is a most interesting and instructive fact.

That it should now obtain is a good illustration of the ease with which our women can adopt all customs which are French and bad. Its exposure may go far to check that growing extravagance in gauds which brings many a family from trafficking with the house which displays one Ball on its sign to dealing with those which expose three.

The forfeitures are fixed as follows: For delaying departure for forty-eight hours, £160; for seventy-two hours, £450; if any mail is not duly delivered after November, £125; no larger sum to be forfeited in one month than £700, (which, by the way, is £250 more than the monthly subsidy.) Payments are to be made quarterly, two months' instalments to be reserved in the first six months, and afterwards one month's instalment to be always in arrears. If the vessel is lost and the mails saved, they are to be transmitted at the expense of the contractor. The public may terminate the contract at one month's notice for repeated failure to fulfill contract.

"For several years past, a few property-owners upon the line of Atlantic-street labored to secure the passage of an ordinance prohibiting the use of steam power on the Long Island Railroad, within the City limits. Time and again resolutions were passed by the Common Council, giving notice to the Company to desist from using steam; and time and again, when the objects of the speculators who had secured the passage of such a resolution had been attained by its mere adoption, the Railroad Company was permitted to continue the use of steam, until another opportunity for speculation occurred.

"-- The body of Mr. F.A. LUMSDEN, having at last been recovered on the shore of Lake Michigan, near the scene of the appalling disaster to the Lady Elgin, and brought to the city friends for interment, was entombed last evening by fitting honors. The funeral took place from the late residence of the deceased, on Rampart-street. The high dignitaries and many members of the Masonic and Odd Fellows orders, the Continental Guards, and the New-Orleans Typographical Union, (the latter in strong force,) all attended the funeral; the deceased having been long a member of the two orders and the military company, and an honorary member of the Typographical Union. Besides these, officers of the other military companies, and a large concourse of the personal friends of the deceased were present. The office of the Picayune newspaper, with which the deceased was so long and honorably connected as proprietor and Editor, was closed during the day. The Masons having precedence, took charge of the funeral. Their solemn mortuary ceremonies being duly performed at the residence, the coffin was put into the hearse and the procession formed, the Continental Guards leading the way, to the slow measure of the funeral dirge by their band. The procession was both long and imposing. The body was followed to and laid away in the Girod-street Cemetery, the Masons there performing the last and most solemn ceremonies of sepulture.

"-- The New-York correspondent of the Boston Journal tells the following story: ""Quite a scene took place in one of our city cars, in which a well-known lawyer of New-York and a man from the South were the parties.

But he soon came back, and finding only a boy in the office, he clandestinely took the papers and decamped. The next time the parties met were in the cars. The lawyer -- celebrated for that trait of character that enables a legal gentleman to fight his way onward in his practice -- went up to the client and said, 'Sir, I demand the papers you stole from my office.' The man of the South was in a great rage at the public accusation of theft, and threatened all sorts of things. But the lawyer was firm, and with a loud and decided tone demanded the papers.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/26/archives/the-stabbing-affray-at-a-fourth-ward-dancehouse-death-of-the-victim.html,,"WILLIAM P. GREEN, bar-keeper at the dancehouse, No. 275 Water-street, who was stabbed on Wednesday night by a sailor named JOHN McGUIRE, died at 5 o'clock yesterday morning from the effects of the wound. Coroner SCHIEMER was summoned to hold an inquest upon the body, and the proceedings were conducted at the Fourth Ward Ponce Station. It was shown by the testimony that the place in question is kept by JOHN GREEN, a brother of the deceased, and that MCGUIRE, who is a hand on beard the schooner Sunny South, lying at the Atlantic Basin, went there, accompanied by another sailor named JAMES E. HORTON, bent on having some fun. Both men drank several times at the bar and talked with the women, after which they went away. A short interval only elapsed ere they returned to the saloon, when they commenced jostling about as if they desired to create a disturbance -- the prisoner, MCGUIRE, being the more boisterous of the two. Fearing that the man would break a looking-glass that hung against the wall, GREENE bade him leave the premises, but he did not immediately comply with the request, and angry words followed. Finally, however, the prisoner was induced to go out of the place and after he had reached the sidewalk, he drew a sheath-knife from his belt, and brandished it, threatening to kill any person who should approach him. These threats he accompanied with taunting language, addressed to deceased, who at last came out of the dance-house, and asked him to go away from the door, and not make a disturbance there. MCGUIRE made no reply, but at once sprang toward deceased, and thrust the knife into him. The wound thus inflicted was two inches in length, the knife having entered the lower part of the abdomen of deceased, severed the smaller intestines and caused the bowels to fall out. The occurrence was witnessed by a large number of person 5 who had been attracted to the place by the noise, and when the prisoner ran away, which had did as soon as the mischief had been done, he was pursued and overtaken in Water-street, between Fulton and Beekman. Before his arrest was effected, however, he made an attempt to stab another man who sought to bar his flight, but who fortunately warded the blow with a dinner kettle which he had in his hand. Officer SIMONSON, of the Second Precinct, heard the hallooing of the crowd in pursuit of the fugitive, and he succeeded in stopping him. For a second MCGUIRE seemed inclined to resist, but thinking better of it, he gave up his knife and said he was willing to surrender. His face at this time was covered with blood, his nose was bleeding, and his left hand was badly cut. He said that he had been struck on the head with a club, and what he had done was done in self-defence. He did not appear to be drunk and he was very much exited. The officer took him to the Second Ward Station-house, and afterwards conducted him to the scene of the affray in Water-street, where he was fully identified by the deceased as the person who had stabbed him. After GREENE received his wound he walked unassisted into the house and his friends immediately summoned medical aid, but nothing could be done for his relief. Dr. GEO P. BOUTON made a post-mortem examination of the body, finding a wound in the abdomen about two and a half inches in length. Several of the intestines had been cut into, the knife having been nearly driven through the body. The case was submitted to the Jury, and they immediately rendered a verdict of death from stabs at the hands of JOHN MCGUIRE. The prisoner was then committed to prison by the Coroner to await his trial for the deed.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Stabbing Affray at a Fourth Ward Dance-House.; DEATH OF THE VICTIM AND INQUEST UPON THE BODY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Stabbing Affray at a Fourth Ward Dance-House.; DEATH OF THE VICTIM AND INQUEST UPON THE BODY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/df66a70b-fcb2-50d2-8564-3c78b0a5dd4a,731,nyt://article/df66a70b-fcb2-50d2-8564-3c78b0a5dd4a,

Always more than equal to the demands of the role so far as mere volume and force of voice are concerned, and perfectly master of its dramatic aspects, Herr FORMES has never condescended to interpret the music of this singular and striking partition with the musical accuracy which every partition deserves, if it is to be rendered at all. He gives it to us new, with all the merits and all the defects of his established theory and practice in regard to it. Signora FABBRI was an Alice of more than ordinary merit, passionate, pathetic and effective in a very high degree; and Signor STIGELLI did only too much justice to the susceptible role of Robert. In the character of Plunkett, which he will fill to-night, Herr FORMES is without an equal; and if Mme. FABBRI and Signor STIGELLI impart into the graceful and tender music of FLOTOW the really solid lyric qualities which they have never hitherto failed to display, the representation of ""Martha"" at the Academy this evening will be deservedly remembered as a great musical event.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4ffc4ff-0313-57c0-9a8e-62f51971300c,1995,nyt://article/f4ffc4ff-0313-57c0-9a8e-62f51971300c,

Public sentiment has changed somewhat since those laws were passed -- has become in a measure debauched.

It will have a front of 50 feet and a depth of 72, and will afford sitting room for 900 persons. The Fourth Presbyterian Congregation which has been worshipping in a small building on Baltimore-street, has taken the preliminary steps towards removing to the corner of Fayette and Cary streets, where it will erect an edifice 66 by 90 feet, which will accommodate about 700 persons, at a probable expense of $30,000. Of this sum $10,000 has already been subscribed by the widow of the late GEORGE BROWN, and $5,000 by a successor of the distinguished Dr. NEVINS. No difficulty is anticipated in raising the balance of the sum named. The Huntingdon Methodist Episcopal Church is about to erect a new building, 50 feet by 75, on the corner of Decker-street and Huntingdon-avenue; the congregation of St. John's Independent Methodist Protestant Church is making extensive improvements in the building which it now occupies; a new church for the Sharp-street M.E.

Church is rapidly pushing forward the erection of a new building, and among the other congregations which are moving actively in the same direction maybe mentioned those of the First Universalist Church, of the United Presbyterian Church, of the New-Jerusalem or New Christian Church, and of the St. James Catholic Church.

"HUDSON COUNT COURT. -- DAVID J. SWAIN, JOHN FAULHNER and FREDERICK H.

We really think, however, that the indignation of Messrs.

When GEORGE IV. was crowned King of England, the jewels in his coronet, borrowed expressly for the occasion, were valued at a million and a half of pounds sterling, and the fortunate London jeweler received $200,000 as interest for their use. In a moral point of view, there is certainly very little difference between lending jewels for the coronation of one Prince of Wales, or lending jewels for a ball given in honor of another. We condemned the wretched taste and extravagance of those New-York women who appeared in borrowed finery at the Prince's Ball; but unless Messrs. TIFFANY & CO., and Messrs.

Mr. PIERSON, President of the City Company, made a detailed statement as to the claims, rights and existing difficulties, and was followed by Mr. LITCHFIELD, President of the Central Company, and Messrs. KELSEY and STANTON, of the Board of Directors. After some two hours' time had been used up in presenting the subject in detail, the Committee decided that they were only authorized I to see whether there was any possibility of a temporary arrangement being made so as to have the route operated immediately, and until such time as the Courts decided the rights of the respective Companies. Mr. LITCHFIELD renewed the propositions which he said had been made the day before, when Committees of the two Companies were in consultation: 1. To perfect the original agreement between the Companies, the Central Company to operate the route and pay 6 per cent. for the use of the City Company's track. 2. To leave the matter to the decision of three disinterested Presidents of railroads. 3. To leave it to any three persons -- one to be selected by each Company and the third by the two referees thus selected. 4. To the Mayor. Another proposition was, to operate the road under proposition No. 1, temporarily. The reference in each case to be considered binding, -- all of which the City Company's Committee, Mr. LITCHFIELD said, the day before had declined. The Chairman of the Committee asked if Mr. PIERSON was authorized to accept either of these propositions. He said he was not able to say that the Company would accept either, but said that he would call a meeting of the Board of Directors and consider any propositions the Common Council Committee might see fit to make. The only proposition he was authorized to make was, that the City Company would run as many cars over the Furman-street route as the public accommodation might require, at two cents one way and one cent the other, or one and one-half cent for each passenger, until such time as the suit now pending should be determined. This the Central Company refused to accept, and that Company would accept of no proposition which did not give the Central Company the right to operate the road. The Committee adjourned with a view to prepare propositions to be presented to the City Company. Mr. PIERSON asked Mr. LITCHFIELD if the Central Company would consent to let the City Company cross Atlantic-street under any circumstances. To which Mr. LITCHFIELD replied, that when they were satisfied that they were dealing with men who would carry out their agreements, they would give the Central Company the use of their road on Atlantic-street. Mr. KELSEY desired it to be particularly understood that in tearing up the City Company's Railroad track on Atlantic-street on Thursday, he had acted as a citizen, and not as a Director of the Central Railroad Company.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87d40734-b050-51e2-8545-0d7c5b37a95a,686,nyt://article/87d40734-b050-51e2-8545-0d7c5b37a95a,

"-- On Tuesday night of last week, Dr. BACHMAN, of Rock Grove, was stabbed by one CONRAD BAKER, it is thought fatally, under the following circumstances: BAKER had been working the farm belonging to widow SPANGLER, and was living, it seems, upon terms of improper intimacy with the widow. He had for some time had suspicions and jealousies of a certain neighbor, who paid, he thought, too much attention to the widow. On Tuesday last, BAKER, who slept up stairs, heard some one down stairs with the widow, and, supposing it to be the person alluded to, rushed down, and finding a man with her in a position which admitted of no explanation, at once commenced an attack. The person attacked, who proved to be Dr. BACHMAN, defended himself with a chair, but BAKER stabbed him in several places, one of the stabs severing one of his kidneys. This, it is thought, must prove fatal. BAKER was arrested and lodged in jail, and on Thursday night tore up one of the sheets to his bed, and hung himself from the gratings over his cell door.

"The death of Dr. GEORGE SHRORTER, which occurred at Paterson, N.J., on Thursday morning, has already been announced by telegraph. Dr. SHRORTER was a native of Prussia, and graduated at the Universities of Konigsberg and Berlin, making philology and the natural sciences his principal studies. For some rears after leaving the University, he acted as Private Secretary to the Prince Regent of Prussia, traveling with him through a large part of Europe, and enjoying remarkable opportunities for becoming acquainted with the working of its various Governments. Immediately upon the breaking out of the Revolutions of 1818 Dr. SHRORTER, sided with the Liberals and resigned all connection with his royal patron, whose sympathies were with the reactionists. In company with many other patriots he found himself obliged to leave his country and take refuge in the United States, in 1849. Dr. SHRORTER immediately applied himself to the geography of this Continent, and in connection with the Geographical and Statistical Society, his abilties soon began to attract notice. In 1856 he completed a map of the United States from ocean to ocean, on a canvas thirty feet by seventeen. After remaining several weeks at the Merchants' Exchange of this City for exhibition, this was sent to its destination, the Stock Exchange of London. The map contained every railroad and canal in the country, completed or in progress. Since then he has executed models of this country in war, showing the elevations and depressions of its surface. His labors have by no means received the appreciation which they so richly deserved. At the time of his death Dr. SHRORTER was but 43 years of age. He removed to Paterson four or five years ago, hoping to be able to pursue his studies there with less interruption, and on the 17th was taken with inflammation of the lungs. The severity of his mental labors doubtless favored the progress of the disease, which terminated fatally on the 25th.

KELLING recently arrived at the port of Boston, where information came to him that KOENIG had circulated a report reflecting upon the reputation of a young woman to whom he was attached. He at once determined to avenge the assumed injury by murdering the alleged calumniator. With this purpose in view he purchased a bowie-knife, had it sharpened, and left Boston on Friday evening to put his intention into execution. As soon as he reached this City, he went to KOENIG's store and characterized him as a scoundrel and a liar, at the same time attempting to cut his throat. In this, however, he failed, but he nevertheless inflicted a terrible wound, the blade having entered KOENIG's mouth, breaking the jawbone, and extending to a point behind the right ear. Before the assailant could escape, Officer C. BROWN came up and took him into custody. He was taken before Justice CONNOLLY, at Jefferson Market Court, to whom he made a statement of the affray similar to that above narrated, and added that he was sorry for having failed to kill the object of his wrath.

This is a very grave imputation upon the honor, humanity and patriotism of the Fire-eaters, but it is fully sustained by their own declarations, or those of their newspapers and orators. Despairing of reopening the Slave-trade, and of enjoying the luxury of cheap negroes while the Union lasts, this deprivation has been a favorite argument with the Southern Democratic leaders for a dissolution of the Federal compact. The fact charged upon the Cotton State Democracy by the Virginia journals is by no means new to us; but we call attention to their recognition of it as a sign of progress. No more disastrous event to the slave interest of Virginia and other old Slave States, where negro labor is already superabundant, could occur, than the revival of the African Slave-trade. That piratical traffic is repugnant to the moral sense of Northern men, but its revival would be to the slaveholders north of the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude, simple pecuniary ruin, to say nothing of the fearful addition it would make to that dangerous class of population.

By the Asia we learn that tremendous military preparations are being made by Austria in Venetia, and a rumor was current that a large force had crossed the Po and the Mincio. The rumor was not generally credited, but the London Times lends encouragement to the belief that this important step was really contemplated by the Emperor FRANCIS JOSEPH, and would be carried out. Some authorities deny, and others state positively, that Russia, Austria and Prussia had protested against the entry of the Sardinian troops into Neapolitan territory. However this may be, a semi-official article in the Constitutionnel alleges that the act, as well as the invasion of the Papal States, are flagrant violations of the principles of neutrality and non-intervention invoked by Piedmont herself. The French army in Rome, it is reported, will be increased to 60,000 men. Our foreign files furnish us with interesting details of the great struggle at Volturno, in which GARIBALDI achieved so signal a victory and displayed such undaunted heroism. Telegrams dated the 13th inst. say that the Dictators troops had succeeded in occupying fresh positions under the walls of Capua. Severe cannonading had been kept up during the 11th, 12th and 13th.

Independent of his position as member of the Legislative Council, Mr. De Blazmere held the title of ""honorable"" in his own right, being the youngest son of Lord John de Blazmere, of Ardkill county, Londonderry. When very young, he entered the Navy and served as a Midshipman under the celebrated Captain Bligh, of the Bounty, at the battle of Camperdown. He was also present at the mutiny of the Nore. Leaving the navy, however, at an early age he devoted himself to more peaceful pursuits, and emigrated to Canada in 1837. Here he soon attained to the highest honours. In 1858 he was selected as a fit person for a seat in the Legislative Council, which he continued to hold until the time of his death. On the remodeling of the Toronto University, he was appointed to the honorable office of Chancellor, but subsequently resigned. He was also a member of the Anglican Synod, where he commanded great respect.

"Mr. SAMUEL HOTALING, a prominent merchant of this City, formerly a Henry-Clay Whig, more recently a Fillmore man, but now a Republican, addressed the Young Men's Republican Union at their head-quarters, in Stuyvesant Institute, last evening, upon the issues of the campaign.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/30/archives/young-mens-republican-union-speech-by-samuel-hotaling-esq.html,,"Mr. SAMUEL HOTALING, a prominent merchant of this City, formerly a Henry-Clay Whig, more recently a Fillmore man, but now a Republican, addressed the Young Men's Republican Union at their head-quarters, in Stuyvesant Institute, last evening, upon the issues of the campaign. After alluding to the fact that he had been for 25 years a merchant in this City, doing business with men from all sections of the country; that he had traveled over all the Northern and most of the Southern States, and had made careful observations of the commercial, mechanical, and agricultural resources of both sections, he proceeded to consider at length the question of Slavery, and its relations to the Republican Party and to the country at large. While admitting that Slavery, as it existed in the Southern States, was not a barbarous institution, but was destined under Providence, to work out the ultimate good of the African race, he yet opposed its extension on the ground that the area of Slave Territory was already nearly double that of free territory, and that more territory was not, and would not be for one hundred years to come, needed for Slavery, while it would be needed for Freedom. If all the slaves of all the Southern States were transported to the State of Missouri, and added to the population already there, the State, even then, would not be as thickly populated as the State of New-York now is. And yet a great portion even of New-York was at this day a wilderness. The Slave States, with a population of about 9,000,000, black and white, had an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles; while the Free States, with a population of 13,000,000 and over, had an area of only 454,000 square miles. In view of these facts there was no necessity, even in the interest of Slavery, for an extension of the institution into new territory, while the rapid increase of free population required that the remaining territory should be reserved for its occupation. The African race, Mr. HOTALING believed, were destined eventually to be restored to their native country, and that their temporary servitude here was the means under God of working out their ultimate salvation and that of their race. To show the improved condition of an American slave over a native African, he related the following: A gentleman, a merchant in this City, with whom I am well acquainted, informed me last year that he had just then received a letter from his own brother, then living in Western Africa, just south of the Guinea Coast, and that he had just attended a large funeral at the residence of one of the Kings there; and that 1,400 persons of their own African blood and kindred were, in cold blood, slaughtered there to celebrate that funeral. And also, that it is a common circumstance, on the occasion of making a dinner party or feast, to slaughter from twenty to fifty living human beings to show their zeal or friendship for their guests. This, gentlemen, is the state and national condition of that portion of Africa now. Revolting as it may seem to you, and untruthful as it may appear to the African population of the United States, it is nevertheless true. And much more might be added to this story of inhumanity practiced there in that land of the fathers of our African people.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/30/archives/general-city-news.html,,"THE BILLIARD TOURNAMENT The Billiard Tournament continues to excite great interest, and the room of Mr. LYNCH, in Fourteenth-street, where it is held, is daily crowded to its utmost capacity by gentlemen who feel an interest in the game. The games yesterday were first between Messrs. KAVANAGH & WHITE, and did not excite as much interest as was anticipated, The scores made by either were far inferior to their ordinary play. Mr. WHITE was beaten by 132 points, the highest run in the game being 53, which was made by Mr. KAVANAGH, who is a cool and graceful player, but who was evidently nursing himself for the grand contest of Wednesday. The second game between Messrs. TIERNAN and LYNCH, was one of the closest and best-contested of any thus far played. Mr. PHELAN, before the game commenced made an apology for Mr. LYNCH on account of ill-health, which was borne out by his appearance, and on account of the damp atmosphere which affected the tables and balls. The game was then commenced and Mr. LYNCH led off hi some splendid runs, ranging from 74 to 16, but towards the close of the frame his lusty but good-natured antagonist was shined up, and when the game was even within a single point, made a splendid run of 85, and was proclaimed the victor. On Wednesday Messrs. KAVANAGH and TIEMAN will play, and as the prize cue undoubtedly lies between them, much interest is felt as to the result. On Thursday Mr. PHELAN will play a game of 500 points with the winner, on which occasion ladies will be admitted.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-10-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a9d22374-09ff-5152-950a-251edb7a50da,895,nyt://article/a9d22374-09ff-5152-950a-251edb7a50da,

GALUSHA A. GROW, of Pennsylvania, was the principal speaker. Every vacant seat and all the standing-room inside of the building was occupied, and large numbers congregated outside to listen to the address. Mr. GROW, on being introduced, was received with enthusiastic cheers. He said, it could hardly be expected of him, after speaking for the last eight weeks, as TOM CORWIN has said, 36 hours out of 24, that he should detain them with a lengthy speech. The Presidential election might be considered as settled, and nothing remained but for the people to meet, express their preferences and count the votes. It was not necessary, therefore, that he should detain them with arguments in favor of placing ABE LINCOLN of Illinois in the Presidential chair. But there was another and very unfortunate question for them to settle -- a Congress was to be elected, on which would devolve the work of sustaining his Administration, and from which must emanate the bills which would affect, for all time to come, the interests of the country. Mr. GROW then passed to a definition of the features of the Homestead bill, and the advantages which it secured to the actual settlers upon the unoccupied lands of the West; the efforts of the last Congress to pass such a bill; the opposition of Democratic members; and the final veto of the ""Old Public Functionary;"" of the half-way measure which they were finally obliged 10 accept. The bill was intended to close forever the doors of the public land offices against the land monopolist -- the deadliest curse which had ever been inflicted upon the country. He demanded that in this New World the seeds of the giant wrong should not be planted, to bring forth the harvest of misery for the poor man who should seek a refuge for himself and family from the tyranny of capital. By what right, he asked, does the Government seize upon this common bounty to the race, and turn it into a source of revenue? As well might they dam up the springs which the Creator had caused to ""run among the hills"" to quench the thirst of God's children, and set them apart for the benefit of speculators. The poor man, under the present system, was compelled to purchase these lands of speculators at $5 and $10 per acre, and spend the best part of his days in paying the first cost and interest upon the purchase, and then, broken down and exhausted by his hard labors, surrender his improvements to some non-resident speculator. The Government was asked to extend its protection to the families and firesides of these poor men, and make their homes comfortable, by forbidding the speculator to come in and rob them of the fruits of their honest toil. The Homestead bill was framed for this purpose. The deprivations and dangers to which the present system exposed the pioneers, by isolating them from each other, and compelling them to carry the sword in one hand, and the implements of husbandry in the other, was eloquently set forth by the speaker. He referred to the action of the Democratic members of the House of Representatives upon the Homestead bill, the action of the Senate, and the final veto of the President. The policy of the Republican Party had always been that those who had been driven from their homes in Europe, by a necessity as dire as death, should find a free home in the great West, and the protection of the Government for themselves and their families; that they should thus become attached to the Government which afforded them an asylum, and gave them a home and country to love. Yet every member from the Slaveholding States except two, voted against this beneficent measure.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REPUBLICAN MEETING AT GREENPOINT.; Speech of Hon. Galusha A.

In accordance with a previous arrangement the four men named JAMES STEWART, CHARLES RANSOM, JOHN COLTON and FREDERICK BLACKMAN, who are charged with keeping gambling houses, yesterday were brought before Justice KELLY for examination. It will be recollected that the complaints against these men were preferred by WM. HURRY, jr., who, at the time they, were made, was in the custody of detective HOGAN, charged with having embezzled about $5,000 from the firm of QUICK & L'HOMMEDIEU, brokers at No. 42 Pine-street. HURRY stated to the officer that he had lost a portion of the money in question at the faro banks kept by the above-named persons, and he was taken before Justice KELLY, before; whom he lodged the complaints, but at that time the magistrate was not aware of the fact that HURRY was a prisoner on a criminal charge. Warrants for the arrest of the accused parties were accordingly issued and given to Detective HOOAN, who took his own time to serve them, and it was not till after the lapse of two days or more that the prisoners were brought before the magistrate. Even then the officer had taken no pains to secure additional evidence against them, not even the implements with which they pursue their avocation. Yesterday, when all the parties were in Court, the counsel for QUICK & L'HOMMEDIEU begged to withdraw the complaint against HURRY, alleging that as it failed to charge any intent to defraud it was incomplete. HURRY was therefore discharged, but he was directed to find bail in the sum of $500 to appear, and prosecute at the Court of Special Sessions on the 15th of November. The alleged gamblers were also held in $500 each to answer. It is not probable that the trial will result in the conviction of the accused, as the affidavit of the complainant will be looked upon with suspicion, and the officer failed to secure any other evidence to substantiate the charge.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; ""The Jews\' Hospital in New-York.""
