The London Times has been attacked with a sudden fever of anxiety about the future of Italy. The forms in which this disease manifests itself vary from day to day; but its virulence is only to be likened to the fury with which the endemics of southern climes seize upon the constitution of a newly-imported stranger.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/01/archives/france-and-italy.html,,"The London Times has been attacked with a sudden fever of anxiety about the future of Italy. The forms in which this disease manifests itself vary from day to day; but its virulence is only to be likened to the fury with which the endemics of southern climes seize upon the constitution of a newly-imported stranger. The Times is infinitely more distressed about Italy than are the Italians themselves. Only a year ago nothing could exceed the temperance and patience which the Times felt disposed to exercise in regard to the Peninsula. It was true, certainly, that Englishmen could not look with approbation on the Governments of Austria, Rome and Naples. It was not to be expected that Britons could exactly commend a system which degraded the rulers and the ruled alike, and which a British Chancellor of the Exchequer had felt himself compelled to expose and denounce. But then the peace of Europe was so highly important, and the political capacity of the Italians was so very problematical, that the Times could not find it in its heart to encourage the Lombards to rescue their children from the drill-sergeants' cane, or the Romagnoles to shake off the stifling authority of a corrupt priesthood, or the Neapolitans to eject a King who sent his Ministers to the galleys, and exposed the wives of his subjects to the license of his soldiery.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France and Italy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France and Italy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01733a6c-0afd-592c-a0f4-13dd7a93408f,1490,nyt://article/01733a6c-0afd-592c-a0f4-13dd7a93408f,

"OPENING OF MESSRS. STEINWAY & SONS' PIANO-FORTE MANUFACTORY. -- The Messrs. STEINWAY & SONS, Piano manufacturers, opened their new factory, comprising a full block, fronting on Fourth-avenue and extending from Fifty-second to Fifty-third-street, yesterday. There was a large and very respectable number of visiters present. The firm of STEINWAY & SONS consists of STEINWAY, Sr., and four sons, all of them practical piano-makers. The family came to this country some eleven years ago, from Brunswick, Germany, where HENRY STEINWAY, Sr., had had a Piano-forte manufactory for over twenty-five years. He brought some capital to America, but before starting in business, himself and sons workedfor three years as journeymen in the various important manufactories in this City, thus adding to their former Old World experience the practical developments of the New World. The following is a description of their factory. The front on Fourth-avenue has a length of two hundred and one feet, with a depth of forty feet. The wing on Fifty-third-street is one hundred and sixty-five feet in length, and is forty feet in depth. The whole building is six stories high, including the basement. The architecture is of the modern Italian style, with brick lintel arches, brown-stone trimmings, and brick dental cornices. In the yard there are four drying houses, each of which is heated by 2,000 feet of steam-pipe, and contains about 60,000 feet of lumber, so that there are about 240,000 feet of lumber, constantly under the process of kiln-drying. There are about 350 men constantly employed, who turn out about thirty square and five grand pianos every week. All the heavier portion of the machinery is located in the basement. In this room are three large planers, one of which is certainly one of the largest instruments of its class existing, planing the largest piano tops or bottoms at once. There are also four up-and-down saws, several circular saws, besides turning lathes, &c. The three stories above are occupied by the case-makers, who take all the single parts made below, put them together, and veneer and finish the cases ready to go up to the top floor, or varnishing room, where every case remains from three to four months, to be thoroughly varnished. On each case-making floor there are three large warming boxes, constructed of sheet-iron, and covered with wood, with sufficient steam-pipes in them to raise the heat to 200&#194;&#176;. The varnishing department comprises the top floor, extending the whole length of the front and side building -- a length of three hundred and sixty-six feet. From this floor the completely varnished cases are taken one floor lower down in the front building -- the sounding-board floor -- where the sounding-boards are fitted in. In the floor below, the instruments are strung, the action and key-boards fitted in, and the tops, legs, and lyres adjusted and put on. The partly-finished instruments are then taken first to the floor below, where the action is regulated, thence to the first-floor, where the hammers and the tone are regulated; after which, the final polish is put on the cases, and the perfect piano is ready to be sent down to the salesroom. The front basement contains all the iron-work, plates and bars, drilling-machines, japanning works, and the rosewood veneers. Of the latter the stock on hand is rarely of less value than $8,000. Every part of the factory is heated by means of steam-pipes -- 30,000 feet of which line the interior. The wood-heating apparatus is also warmed by steam, which also heats the kilns for japanning, etc., etc There are about six hundred pianos constantly in course of construction, and these, in connection with the hardware, machinery, engine, veneers, lumber, &c., represent at least the sum of $350,000, exclusive of the buildings. The cost of the building and ground is about $150,000. At the entertainment which followed the inspection of the building, interesting speeches were made by H.L.

The partly-finished instruments are then taken first to the floor below, where the action is regulated, thence to the first-floor, where the hammers and the tone are regulated; after which, the final polish is put on the cases, and the perfect piano is ready to be sent down to the salesroom. The front basement contains all the iron-work, plates and bars, drilling-machines, japanning works, and the rosewood veneers. Of the latter the stock on hand is rarely of less value than $8,000. Every part of the factory is heated by means of steam-pipes -- 30,000 feet of which line the interior. The wood-heating apparatus is also warmed by steam, which also heats the kilns for japanning, etc., etc There are about six hundred pianos constantly in course of construction, and these, in connection with the hardware, machinery, engine, veneers, lumber, &c., represent at least the sum of $350,000, exclusive of the buildings. The cost of the building and ground is about $150,000. At the entertainment which followed the inspection of the building, interesting speeches were made by H.L.

Lord DUFFERIN has instructions, when he visits Syria, to take steps with this end in view, and communications will also be made to the Ambassadors at Constantinople to induce them to cooperate with Lord DUFFERIN in endeavoring to accomplish this object. The two chiefs, KURSCHID PASHA and OSMAN BEY, have, it is true, been sent to Constantinople for the purpose of being tried. Whether one of them, being a military officer, was received with the military honors attaching to his rank I do not know, and cannot consequently inform the House; but it is also true that they have, been sent back to Syria, to be there tried for their crimes. Evidence will, of course, be more easily obtained on the spot; and I hope and trust that when they are arraigned they may receive the reward due to their atrocities.

Most interesting accounts have been received of the departure of the first Italian expedition to invade the main coast. It seems to be still a matter of doubt whether or not GARIBALDI in person landed in Calabria. One body of men successfully disembarked, and, making their way to the mountains, have been there reinforced. We shall probably hear by the next mail of the transportation of the entire Garibaldian army across the narrow straits which divide Sicily from the main land. According to Le Nord, a written protocol has been drawn up of the points arranged between the Emperor of Austria and the Prince of Prussia at the late Toplitz interview.

"A little over a year ago, Mrs. SOLOMON COLE, wife of a well-to-do farmer, of the town of Wantage, Sussex County, New-Jersey, died under circumstances which afforded ground for the suspicion that she had been murdered in order to obtain a considerable sum of money, for which, a short time previous to her demise, her life had been insured. The case excited a great deal of interest at the time, on account of the social position of the parties implicated in the matter, and the fearful developments of the depth of degradation to which a lust for gold would lead persons of apparent respectability. From the published statements of the affair, it appeared that a few weeks before the anticipated confinement of deceased, COLE was induced by one DAVID D. WICKHAM, a practicing physician, residing at Hamburgh, a place ten miles distant from Wautage, to insure his wife's life in a New-York Company, for which the doctor acted as agent. An agreement was entered upon by which COLE was to pay the first instalment of the premium, after which, WICKHAM was to pay the annual interest. If, however, Mrs. COLE died during her confinement, then the insurance money was to be divided equally between the husband and the physician, who also had engaged to attend her during her illness. WICKHAM happened to be absent from the county when Mrs. COLE was taken sick, and another physician attended her until after the fifth day from the birth of her child, when he resigned his charge, apparently under favorable circumstances, to the care of the accused. Almost immediately after the administration of a mixture, which WICKHAM had prepared for her, the poor woman was thrown into convulsions, and her death soon resulted. Notwithstanding her sudden decease, no suspicion attached to WICKHAM until some days subsequent to the funeral, when it became known that he had entered a claim for the insurance upon Mrs. COLE's life, in accordance with the arrangement adverted to. The matter having been canvassed, it was finally decided to exhume the body and hold a post-mortem examination, which demonstrated, upon the chemical analysis of the contents of the stomach and intestines by Dr. DOREMUS, that the woman's death had been produced by strychnine. An inquest was held, and the jury rendered a verdict implicating both COLE and the doctor. The accused were arrested, and the husband was tried for the murder, but the evidence would not sustain the charge, and he was acquitted. Meanwhile Dr. WICKHAM had been placed under heavy bonds to answer, but he escaped from the custody of the officer who was conveying him to prison, and managed to elude pursuit. Diligent search has since been made for him, and a reward of $500 was offered by the New-Jersey authorities for his apprehension, but no trace of him was obtained until Saturday afternoon, when he was arrested by Officer NIVEN, of the Second Precinct. The prisoner was seen in Chatham-street, walking with his wife, by Mr. WM.C. WARDELL, NO. 22 Beekman-street, who formerly resided in Sussex County and was perfectly familiar with the appearance of the fugitive. Mr. WARDELL at once communicated with the policeman, and WICKHAM was taken into custody. He was conducted to the Station-house, where at first he persisted in denying his identity, asserting that his name was JAMES LAMONT, and that he had just returned from Europe. Being confronted, however, with several persons who were acquainted with him at his former residence, he remarked, ""It is no use; I may as well own up,"" and unfastening his vest, displayed the name of DAVID D.

"The second concert of the season was given in Central Park on Saturday afternoon, and drew a much larger audience than that of the Saturday previous. There were not less than 3,000 people collected on the Mall and the adjacent grounds, at least one half of whom were ladies. All the seats beneath the two big tents were occupied at an early hour, and those who arrived later were obliged to seek a resting-place on the steps of the terrace, or on the rising knoll at the cast of the Mall. Large numbers, particularly of the male sex, preferred to take the music standing, or rather walking, and under the pretence of looking for a seat, availed themselves of the opportunity to take an individual and collective survey of the female beauty and loveliness of the entire audience. The result must have been highly satisfactory, for it was a general subject of remark that the audience combined more of female beauty, of intelligence, of dress, and of that undefined word called ""respectability,"" than any out-door collection of the same size ever seen in New-York. The gay carriages of the wealthy, the aristocratic, the luxurious, or the lazy, halted, one after another, as they rolled past the Mall, to catch the ""voluptuous swell"" of the music, until at one time not less than a hundred steeds were dancing and pawing the earth to the music of Dodworth's band. The more romantically inclined, to whom the enchantment of music, like that of mountains, lies in the distance, rambled off to the ""Ramble,"" where, reclining upon the grass, they drank in the floating echoes as they ""began and died upon the gentle wind."" Each one enjoyed himself in his own way, and all were entertained, delighted, enchanted. Even the Hamburg swans seemed to forget the death of their companions when they heard the sweet strains of Fatherland and the notes of the great German composers sailing in the upper air, and as they came floating down the lake towards the mall, with their snow-white bosoms ""rising graceful o'er the wave;"" they bent their necks in courtesy and apparent thankfulness to the Park Commissioners for their joy of the entertainment. The Central Park concerts, judging from the manner in which they have been received thus far, are destined to become one of the institutions, and not the least popular one of Manhattan Island.

There were not less than 3,000 people collected on the Mall and the adjacent grounds, at least one half of whom were ladies. All the seats beneath the two big tents were occupied at an early hour, and those who arrived later were obliged to seek a resting-place on the steps of the terrace, or on the rising knoll at the cast of the Mall. Large numbers, particularly of the male sex, preferred to take the music standing, or rather walking, and under the pretence of looking for a seat, availed themselves of the opportunity to take an individual and collective survey of the female beauty and loveliness of the entire audience. The result must have been highly satisfactory, for it was a general subject of remark that the audience combined more of female beauty, of intelligence, of dress, and of that undefined word called ""respectability,"" than any out-door collection of the same size ever seen in New-York. The gay carriages of the wealthy, the aristocratic, the luxurious, or the lazy, halted, one after another, as they rolled past the Mall, to catch the ""voluptuous swell"" of the music, until at one time not less than a hundred steeds were dancing and pawing the earth to the music of Dodworth's band. The more romantically inclined, to whom the enchantment of music, like that of mountains, lies in the distance, rambled off to the ""Ramble,"" where, reclining upon the grass, they drank in the floating echoes as they ""began and died upon the gentle wind."" Each one enjoyed himself in his own way, and all were entertained, delighted, enchanted. Even the Hamburg swans seemed to forget the death of their companions when they heard the sweet strains of Fatherland and the notes of the great German composers sailing in the upper air, and as they came floating down the lake towards the mall, with their snow-white bosoms ""rising graceful o'er the wave;"" they bent their necks in courtesy and apparent thankfulness to the Park Commissioners for their joy of the entertainment. The Central Park concerts, judging from the manner in which they have been received thus far, are destined to become one of the institutions, and not the least popular one of Manhattan Island.

Early in the recent session of Parliament a committee was appointed in the Commons to investigate the condition of the shipping interest. It reported, quite recently, in a very long and able paper, which discussed the various influences operating to the disadvantage of trade, and presented various measures as appropriate remedies. A deficiency in the sources of information was ascribed to the neglect of Government, which had been at no pains to collect statistics, and had no compilation of tariffs and commercial reports, from which the facts necessary to a thorough mastery of the question might have been derived. The Committee, however, obtained light enough to satisfy itself that the prolific parent of mischief, is the failure of the United States to reciprocate in any degree the liberal concessions afforded by the repeal of the Navigation acts. The immediate effect of that act was the admission of the shipping of all nations to unrestricted competition in the British colonial trade. The field was a wide one, and the profits incalculable; for British Colonies beset all the pathways of the world, and British markets are of all the most desirable.

The circumstances relating to the decease of DANIEL HORRIGAN, a native of Ireland, 20 years of age, who was fatally injured on the night of the 20th ult., during the progress of a fight between a number of persons, in the bar-room of AUGUSTUS FENDAGO, corner of West and Cedar-streets, were investigated on Saturday by Coroner O'KEEFE. Much testimony was taken, but it was of so contradictory a character, that the jury were unable to determine at whose hands the deceased had received his injuries. His brother PATRICK HORRIGAN, deposed that the fracas grew out of a dispute between LORENZO STEVENS, one of the bar-keepers, and the deceased, with reference to the price of the drinks, and that STEVENS struck him on the face with a bottle and afterwards followed him to the street and threw empty bottles at him. Subsequently STEVENS ran away. FREDERICK HYNE, another of the bar-keepers in the saloon in question, testified that deceased commenced the fight by throwing a tumbler at STEVENS, who returned the blow with his fist. THOS. ENRIGHT then came in to drink, and deceased turned upon and struck him with a bottle, knocking him down. FRANK ENRIGHT, brother of THOMAS, interfered at this stage of the fight, and gave deceased a severe beating. Deceased then crawled out into the street. Several witnesses deposed that STEVENS was not present when HORRIGAN was injured. Upon the arrival of the police THOMAS ENRIGHT and deceased were taken to the New-York Hospital. The former soon recovered sufficiently to leave the institution, but HORRIGAN, whose skull was found to be fractured, died on Friday night. Notwithstanding the fact that the jury failed to implicate any person as the perpetrator of the violence which caused HORRIGAN's death, Coroner O'KEEFE deemed it proper to detain STEVENS, the bar-keeper, to await the action of the Grand Jury, and to issue a warrant for the arrest of FRANK ENRIGHT.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f03227e1-3d46-5692-8e39-f83b387b2226,1987,nyt://article/f03227e1-3d46-5692-8e39-f83b387b2226,

It appeared from the affidavit of Officer Irving, of the Twentieth Precinct, that the prisoner was observed by him to leave the house in question with a bundle under his arm, and, suspecting that it had not come honestly into his possession, he determined to follow and learn what disposition would be made of it. Prime took the package, which proved to be several numbers of a serial publication, entitled the Life of Washington, to the store No. 27 Beekman-street, and offered it for sale, but failing to obtain a purchaser there, he went to No. 109 Nassau-street, and endeavored to dispose of the books for $2. At this stage, Irving took him into custody on suspicion, and upon searching him, found several pawn-tickets, which represented property that was subsequently identified as having been stolen from the complainants. Prime confessed to the officer that he had taken advantage of his familiarity with the apartments of his fellow tenants to commit the burglaries, which were effected by the aid of skeleton keys, and also gave information which led to the recovery of the articles which had not been pawned. In addition to the publications belonging to Mr. Freeman, which were found in possession of the prisoner at the time of his arrest, a gold watch, valued at $50, was also taken from him, while the aggregate value of the articles stolen from Messrs.

BRADY, in his recent letter accepting the nomination of part of the Demcratic Party for Governor, speaks of the necessity of ""rescuing the American Union from any danger which the creeds or practices of the Republican Party may have brought upon it."" Mr. BRADY is a lawyer of astuteness and experience, and not likely to jest on a subject of practical importance. We are bound to assume, therefore, that he really means to assert that the Republican Party has actually adopted, and practices a creed which threatens the very existence of the Union. In this view of the case, we cannot help considering Mr. BRADY as the most interesting phenomenon which has appeared in the Metropolis since ELLA BURNS. The union of so much talent and learning with so much childlike simplicity, is something with which the public is not yet sufficiently familiar to view, it without wonder and admiration. Nobody can help pondering with awe over the mysterious dispensation of Providence which deprives a learned and able lawyer of all his perspicacity and astuteness, the moment he is clothed with the empty honors of ""standard-bearer,"" and makes him see danger to the Government in the Republican Platform at Chicago, and in the attempt of those who believe in it to elect their own candidate in the mode prescribed by the Constitution.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A CASE OF HALLUCINATION HOW TO CURE; IT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A CASE OF HALLUCINATION HOW TO CURE; IT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38d2f8e9-2942-585e-8854-811c580d04c9,688,nyt://article/38d2f8e9-2942-585e-8854-811c580d04c9,

"-- One morning last week the wife of JOHN BUTLER was found in the Rondout Creek. At first it was thought to be a case of accidental drowning, but during the Coroner's investigation the evidence of a girl of ten years of age, named MARY ANN VAUGHN, renders it pretty conclusive that she has been murdered by her husband. It appears that BUTLER, who lives near Wilbur, just below the Washington Company's ice-houses, on Sunday evening had some friends from Rondout at his house, and after an evening of drinking, singing and dancing, he and his wife went, about 10 P.M., part of the way to the village with their guests. The party stopped at FLANNERY's grocery, where JOHN and one of his friends drank; went then some two hundred yards, where the company parted, JOHN and his victim turning homeward again. The villain contrived to lead his wife to the dock at the South Rondout ferry slip, evidently to get her overboard, and eventually drown her. This he accomplished, though not without a struggle in the water, whither she probably dragged him, as there is the mark of a blow on her upper lip, and of his grip on the body of the poor creature. He then went home, took off his wet clothes, concealed them where they were found by the Coronor, went to bed and slept till morning. His hat was afterwards found near the ferry slip. BUTLER worked for one of the ice companies, and has resided thereabouts for some years. His wife was 29 years of age, and leaves three children. It is said that they lived unhappily together, and that BUTLER had frequently threatened to do her violence. Sheriff DEYO has offered a reward of $50 for the arrest of BUTLER.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/04/archives/wife-murder-in-ulster-county.html,,"-- One morning last week the wife of JOHN BUTLER was found in the Rondout Creek.

While the latter was away from home he received letters informing him that all was not as it should be, and urging him to return immediately. He did so and found his wife living at home with her children, but he was satisfied that she had been unfaithful, and availed himself of her temporary absence from the house, to search for letters and documents, which he had good reason to think that he could find. At length he discovered in the bottom of a bonnet box, beneath a piece of newspaper, letters which had passed between his wife and Mr. Lewis, and a certificate that she had been married to him on the 17th of July 1860, by Rev. ELISHA SAWYER of Parma. This he considered sufficient evidence on which to found a complaint, and MR. LEWIS was arrested, as is stated above, and held to bail to answer a charge of seduction at the Oyer and Terminer. Some think that MRS.

In the morning the Social Reformers turned out in great numbers, together with their wives and children, numbering about 7,000 or 8,000, to participate in the festival arranged for the presentation of a new banner; handsomely-embroidered by Mrs. FRANCES KLEIN. The banner represents on one side the Goddess of Liberty, with the inscriptions, ""Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,"" and below, ""E Pluribus Unum.""

"A very, important movement was yesterday inaugurated by the General Superintendent of Police, having for its object the suppression of professional mendicancy. For a long time the business of street-begging has been permitted to prosper, without the least effort on the part of the authorities to prevent it, and it had grown into an evil of proportions so gigantic that scarcely a street in the City has been free from the presence of the creatures whose importunacy offended the busy and whose misery saddened the re[???]ecting portion of the community. In view of this state of facts, coupled with a generally-expressed desire that some action should be taken in the premises, an order was issued on Monday night, from the Police Head-quarters, directing the Captains of the various Police Precincts, excepting these of the Eleventh, Twelfth, Nineteenth and Twenty-second, to have their respective commands in readiness at 11 o'clock A.M. yesterday, to carry out a plan of operations that had already been formed, by which the apprehension of a vast number of the offenders would be effected. The Eleventh and other three wards mentioned as not participating in the foray, were excluded, as the former is the abiding place of a large proportion of the vagrants, who never ply their vocation so near their domiciles, and the others, which, comparatively speaking, are sparsely populated, are not greatly troubled with the presence of vagabonds. The order specified that the Police were to be mustered in plain clothes, but the business upon which they were to enter was kept a secret, not even the Captains, many of whom could scarcely restrain their curiosity within decent bounds, being informed of its meaning. But anxiety was in due time relieved. Promptly at the hour named directions were simultaneously transmitted throughout the City, by telegraph, to send each officer upon his ordinary post for the purpose of arresting every beggar, vagrant and idler, regardless of age or sex, that he might meet. The officers entered with spirit and energy upon their work, and disguised as they were, the unwary objects of their attention fell easy victims into their hands. In a remarkably short space of time the several Police Courts were crowded with the prisoners, but it being ""recess hour,"" the magistrates and clerks were absent at luncheon, consequently some delay was caused before a commencement was made in the disposition of the cases.

Once established at Reggio, GARIBALDI held Naples in his hand, to be won or lost by a single decisive effort, and it is more than probable that the miserable FRANCIS II. is at this moment safely housed in some one of the many palatial mansions of his hospitable cousin of Austria. The English Premier, in the House of Commons, has officially declared that Austria will occupy for the present an attitude of strict neutrality, and there can be no reason for supposing that the formal annexation of the entire Neapolitan Kingdom to the Sardinian crown will encounter any foreign obstacles half so troublesome as the domestic difficulties by which GARIBALDI, after taking up his victorious abode at Caserta, will find his tact and his talents more sorely tried than they ever yet have been.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naples and the Italian Revolution.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Naples and the Italian Revolution.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2159ea7c-ee83-5871-b876-e8423aea6caa,629,nyt://article/2159ea7c-ee83-5871-b876-e8423aea6caa,

The Prince Albert, from Galway on the 28th, arrived at St. John, N.F., yesterday on her way to New-York. The news by these arrivals is highly important. The invasion of Calabria by GARIBALDI is fully confirmed. In fact, at last accounts, he had already pushed his operations with such vigor that several important positions of the Neapolitans were in his possession. Great numbers of insurgents were joining him, and a general and decisive battle was looked for. It is thought probable in some quarters, however, that Naples may fall into his hands without bloodshed, as it is believed that the Neapolitan army cannot be relied upon at all for its defence. It was positively denied by Lord PALMERSTON in the House of Commons, that Austria either has sent or contemplates sending a threatening note to Sardinia on the subject of the invasion of Naples. Orders have been given by the French Emperor to concentrate troops to the number of 100,000, with all munitions of war, to be ready to march at a moments' notice. The Emperor and Empress had gone to Savoy and Nice. At Lyons, in response to addresses, the Emperor made a speech, in which he deprecated the attempts which had been made to create a misunderstanding as to his motives.

"We had occasion some days since to make a passing comment upon an opinion recently rendered by Mr. Attorney-General BLACK, to the President, in relation to a joint prayer of the Legislature of California, asking Executive interference in a great suit now pending before the Courts of that State.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/06/archives/the-new-almaden-mine-and-attorneygeneral-black.html,,"We had occasion some days since to make a passing comment upon an opinion recently rendered by Mr. Attorney-General BLACK, to the President, in relation to a joint prayer of the Legislature of California, asking Executive interference in a great suit now pending before the Courts of that State. As this opinion, formally put forth by the first law officer of the Government, reached us, nothing apparently could be more plain than the justice of the views which it expressed. We are not commonly given to a blind admiration of the existing Administration, and our readers will bear us witness that we have never exhibited any extravagant tendency to applaud the acts of Mr. BUCHANAN and his Cabinet, on the mere faith of their political position. But it seemed to us so unquestionably correct for the President to reject a petition looking to his intervention in a matter still under judicial examination, that we could not find it in us to refuse our tribute of praise to the soundness of Mr. Attorney-General BLACK's official advice given to the same effect. Still, the importance of the interests at stake in the particular case out of which the necessity had arisen for Judge BLACK to void, and for the President to receive so much legal wisdom, was so singularly illustrated by the extraordinary conduct of the Legislature of California, that we could not refrain from entertaining some doubts as to the absolute recklessness of our Pacific brethren in the premises. The Attorney-General of the United States, even at the close of the term which is conceded to him for the exercise of his talents, is a considerable personage, certainly. But it may fairly be presumed when the people, the Press, and the representatives of a sovereign State unite with scarce a dissenting voice in demanding a special service of the Federal Government, that they are not actuated simply by a mad determination to violate the first principles of social order. A calm inquiry into the circumstances out of which the application of California to the President arose, will prove, we fear, not merely the justice of this presumption, but the exceeding rashness also, to brand it by no harsher name, which has been displayed by the Attorney-General in his whole management of this great case of the New Almaden Mines, which is to fake its place among the imperishable causes celebres of the Western Continent.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Almaden Mine and AttorneyGeneral Black.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Almaden Mine and AttorneyGeneral Black.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MERCURY (QUICKSILVER)', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ac16e3a1-23be-52db-b5d9-5aa71c8a5248,1333,nyt://article/ac16e3a1-23be-52db-b5d9-5aa71c8a5248,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/06/archives/police-reports-robbery-of-a-wool-merchant-an-ingenicus-mode-of.html,,"For several months past, Mr. William Boardman, a dealer in wool, at No. 74 Pine-street, has been a heavy loser by the depredations of a gang of thieves upon his stock, and the operations of the rogues have been conducted in so mysterious a way that not until yesterday did the efforts which have been made for their detection result in their arrest. On several occasions an invoice of, say 100 bales, would be received during an afternoon, and next morning the discovery would be made that only 98 of the packages remained in the store. At first it was thought that the clerks must have made an error in counting, and particular care was afterwards exercised to obviate such mistakes in future. Notwithstanding this fact, on the morning after the reception of the goods the inevitable discrepancy of two bales between the number received and the quantity in the store would be apparent. Mr. Boardman engaged an experienced man to watch his place of business, but this effected no diminution of the robberies, which had by this time amounted to the value of $1,000. At this stage of the matter Capt. Walling, of the Detective Police, was made acquainted with the circumstances, and he directed Officer Eustace to take the case in hand. He accordingly spent several nights in watching the premises, but the thieves eluded his vigilance and managed to carry away a bale of the wool during that time. Eustace was astonished at the fact, although not discouraged, knowing well that the exercise of patience and tact would result in the capture of the rogues. On Saturday night, therefore, he took a position on the roof of Mr. Boardman's store, and awaited further developments. A few hours elapsed and his attention was attracted by the noise made by some person within the building, who cautiously opened a window on the fifth story, in the rear, and almost immediately thereafter pushed a bale of wool out, which fell into the yard. From the yard easy access was had to the shop of Andrew Ryan, a dealer in old junk, located directly in the rear of the wool-merchant's place, and there the officer suspected that the wool was disposed of. The whole mystery of the robbery having been thus explained satisfactorily to his mind, he did not go rashly to work and arrest the thief then within the building, prefering to make the case so clear that all implicated in the transaction should receive their merited punishment. It being a difficult matter to identify stolen wool, the detective next day proposed to Mr. Boardman to procure some handbills and deposit them in in the bales, by which means their identity could be established. The suggestion was acted upon, and time having been given for the perpetration of another robbery, the junk-shop was searched, and two bales of wool, which were identified by means of the hand-bills, as the property of Mr. Boardman, were found. Ryan stated that he had purchased the wool a long time ago, but the proof to the contrary was strong against him, and he was arrested on a charge of having received stolen goods. Subsequent inquiries developed the fact that John Aggerton, the porter of the store, had been accustomed to lock one of the laborers, named John McDonald, within the building, for the purpose of stealing the wool, and the theft was accomplished in the manner described. Aggerton and McDonald were accordingly taken into custody, and conducted before Justice WELSH at the Tombs Police Court, who held them to answer fer the larceny. Ryan was also held by the same magistrate on the charge of receiving stolen goods.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; ROBBERY OF A WOOL MERCHANT AN INGENICUS MODE OF STEALING.

States soldiers, accused of hanging a man who had stabbed one of their comrades in, a barroom, had been liberated from custody by the civil authorities for want of sufficient evidence. We must say that we are greatly surprised at the action of the military authorities in ever allowing them to be subjected to the humiliation and inconvenience of an examination. A man does not. we believe, forfeit his rights as a citizen on becoming a soldier of the Republic, and the right to hang anybody whose personal appearance is disagreeable, or whose previous history is hot well known, seems to be just now the right of all others which the citizens of Texas cherish most fondly. To arrest half a dozen persons for putting a man to death because his conduct displeased them, must certainly, viewed in the light of Texan morals, be considered a gross outrage, even when committed on private soldiers, and every law-abiding citizen will be glad to see that the officials have receded from their odious, and ridiculous position. Each week's mail from that model community bears a stronger and stronger resemblance to the recent accounts from Syria and Montenegro. The citizens seem to have taken to the business of hanging with as keen a relish as the Druses and Montenegrins to cutting off heads. No Turkish Pasha in the days of AMURATH was ever more jocose over a heap of infidel skulls than the newspapers of that Christian and civilized region over the daily murders which are now being perpetrated of every unfortunate stranger whom a drunken mob chooses to accuse of Abolitionism. The San Antonio Ledger, for example, informs us that ""a wandering mapseller has just been translated to another sphere of action;"" that ""a negro boy accompanied him in his permanent suspension from earthly duties."" The wit of the Galveston News is still more ghastly when it informs us that the ""Abolitionist J.E. LEMON had been prevented by a material impediment from leaving the State; that he had climbed a tree, and we presume had hurt himself in coming down."" Merriment of this sort, if it does not strike us, in this latitude, as very promotive of cheerfulness, at least reveals the spirit by which the Pro-Slavery zealots in Texas are now animated. That there is no real excuse for the bloody saturnalia, in which they are indulging, is made manifest by the bogus letter which we published yesterday morning, purporting to be from one Abolitionist incendiary to another. Every line of it contained clear evidence that it was the composition of a stupid and ignorant defender of the ""peculiar institution,"" that the writer was not only a forger, but a blockhead. In times of real danger and distress men do not resort to means of this sort to quicken the public zeal. The realities of the situation are generally found amply sufficient to arouse people into activity. Forged letters are, on the contrary, one of the ordinary accompaniments of gross impostures and delusions, got up by knaves for their own profit and the confusion and terror of their neighbors, and there has never been a bloody outbreak of insane credulity, from the days of DOMITIAN to the days of TITUS OATES. in which they did not figure.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Terrorism in Texas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Terrorism in Texas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/992fa315-4b7a-5700-954d-cc5b5bc2616c,1214,nyt://article/992fa315-4b7a-5700-954d-cc5b5bc2616c,

The regular monthly meeting of the Trustees of the above-named Society took place last evening, President JELLINGHAUS in the Chair. From the statement made by the agent of the Society, it appears that the number of German emigrants arrived here during the past month amounted to 3,095. They arrived in 42 vessels from various European ports. He also stated that the German emigrant who had been so severely beaten during his passage from Liverpool, on board of the ship Ellen Austin, by the Captain, that he had to be removed to the Hospital for medical treatment, had been induced to leave the City, by giving him a free passage to Chicago. He was also induced to sign a document in which he gave up all claims for damages. The Captain of the vessel and others put it out of the power of the Society to punish him. According to the statement of the Treasurer, there is a balance of $2,167 95 left in the Bank. During the past month $174 62 were distributed among the poor, and the total expenses during the same time amounted to $316 23. 131 men received employment through the agency of the Society. On motion, it was resolved to appropriate $200 to be spent among the poor during the ensuing month. Mr. JELLINGHAUS then reported that he had been on Ward's Island with the Commissioners of Emigration, and expressed himself highly satisfied with the treatment of the inmates and the general management of affairs. He attributed these changes to the new Superintendent, who had adopted a different plan altogether than the two former Superintendents, who had treated the inmates more like criminals than like poor, homeless, unfortunate creatures as they were. He also stated that the Commissioners were about to erect a new building on the Island for the reception and treatment of lunatic paupers. He said that if it was put up according to the plans and specifications it promised to be fit for its purpose.

After the death of the girl, Dr. GRISCOM, who treated her during her sickness, investigated the case, called attention to the violation of the law by the druggist, and tried to have the matter brought to the attention of the proper authorities; but his efforts were frustrated by the hasty and inefficient manner in which the Coroner performed his duty, that official having refused to allow a post-mortem examination, and neglected to summon the proper witnesses, or to take any measure whatever to bring the druggist to justice for his violation of the law, or even to allow the fact to become known to the public. On a further inquiry, the Doctor said he learned that the druggist who sold the poison was a brother-in-law of a prominent City official, the head of one of the Departments.

There were fewer extraneous features of an unpleasant nature about it than are usuallyobservable at gatherings of the kind. Excellent order was maintained, not only within the ground, but, within a certain limit, without. By a special enactment of the Legislature of the State, the Society is given exclusive jurisdiction over the territory immediately surrounding the inclosure in which its fairs are held. The Police of Elizabeth City on this occasion watched over the public peace. The gamblers, who took up their quarters, near the entrance on the first day, were speedily put to flight, and a few drunken men who became nuisances were summarily disposed of. The track on which the horses were put through their paces was kept clear, and riotous customers were under constant surveillance. On Thursday probably 20,000 persons visited the Exhibition.

Benthusen, residing in NewJersey; and doing business as a produce dealer at Washington Market. The theft was alleged to have been committed at a house of ill-fame in Laurens-street, during an interview between the complainant and the accused. The young woman denied the truth of the allegation, and related a piteous story of the wrongs that she had endured, and the causes which had compelled her to lead a life of dishonor. A year since her parents died and she was left under the protection of a male relative, who took advanvantage of his position to entice her from the path of virtue, and subsequently compelled her to marry a person whom she could neither love nor respect. Their incompatibility of temperament speedily resulted in a separation, and she was cast, a houseless wanderer, upon her own resources. Failing, after an earnest search, to obtain employment, and her scanty means having become exhausted, she thought she had no alternative but to accept the offer of one of those panderers to sensuality by whom houses of prostitution are supplied, and entered the house in Laurens-street. Her nature repelled her lot, and she was frequently tempted to commit suicide. Her statement was made with such apparent sincerity that all who heard it gave their credence. Subsequently her story was partially corroborated, and the testimony adduced against her on the charge of larceny being insufficient to warrant her incarceration she was discharged from custody. Her case was afterwards brought to the notice of some philanthropic ladies, and her present necessities having been attended to, an effort will be made to place her in a reputable condition.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Police Reports.; A SORROWFUL CASE A YOUNG WOMAN FORCED TO AN INFAMOUS LIFE.

Rev. Dr. GUTHZIE, one of the most celebrated and eloquent of Scottish ministers presided, and delivered a powerful address, vindicating the Reformation as the cause alike of civil and religious freedom. He did not hesitate to denounce American Slavery vehemently. The programme of the meeting embraced a great variety of topics, on which papers were to be read and addresses delivered. Dr. MCCRIE, Professor in the English Presbyterian College, discussed the Scottish Parliament of 1860 in a very interesting paper. Then a discussion followed, in which, the tendency of a negative theology, which threatens the Episcopal establishment, was eloquently deplored. Dr. KILLEN, author of the Ancient Church, and Professor of Ecclesiastical History to the Irish General Assembly, traced the ""Hand of God in the Reformation"" very eloquently. Dr. LINDSAY ALEXANDER, the well-known Independent Minister, Professor LORINER, of London, Dr. WYLIE, of Edinburgh, and Dr. H[???]HERINGTON, Professor, in the Free College, Glasgow, were the most prominent in the discussions which were had during the first days of the celebration. An entire evening was devoted to the subject of ""The late revival of Religion in Ireland,"" Aug. 17, the last day of the exercises, was to be the most interesting of all. Then, Rev. Dr. LYMINGTON, of Glasgow, was to deliver an address, the foundation stone of the Protestant Institute was to be laid, and in the evening the Earl of Shaftesbury was to take the Chair, and addresses were expected from Mr. DALLAS, United States Minister, Rev. Dr. EDGAR, and others. The success of the celebration, as far as it had progressed, was chiefly ascribed to Rev. Dr. BEGG, of Edinburg, the morning spirit of the Reformation Society of Scotland.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""RELIGIOUS INTELLIGENCE.; Notices of Religious Movements Spirit of the Press.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/08/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"JUVENILE HOUSE OF INDUSTRY The annual public examinations of the Truant Institution at Flatbush were commenced on Thursday and will be brought to a close to-day. The interest of the public in this institution was manifested, yesterday, by a respectable attendance of citizens. The pupils are under the care of Mr. A.C. VAN EPPS as superintendent. By the annual report it appears that the whole, number of children admitted since the institution was established is about 500, of which number 162 were admitted during the past year, and 259 were discharged, total number remaining, 101. The institution was organized under the general vagrant act, passed a few years ago, and is designed solely as a home of reformation. All idle children found about the streets who do not attend the public schools, are liable to be arrested by any officer and sent to this place, unless their parents or friends promise to take care of them. If they neglect their duty in this respect, the children are taken there upon a magistrate's order. There are three Truant officers, whose time is exclusively devoted to looking after the class of children for which, this institution was designed. The public schools are under their particular attention. The truants are hunted up and made to attend school or go to the Truant Home, where they are kept until there are unmistakable evidences of a reform. The effect upon the attendance at the public schools has been marked and decided. The children committed during the last year were for the following crimes: idle and truant, 72; homeless, 15; vagrants, 14; insubordination, 45; petty crimes, 8; poverty of parents, 13; total, 167. Of the whole number 39 were fatherless, 28 motherless and 16 were orphans; about 20 per cent. could read and write, passably, and had made some progress in the elementary branches of study; 33 per cent. could read and spell tolerably; 30 per cent. could read and spell in easy lessons, and 17 per cent. did not know their alphabet. The ages of the children range from 5 to 14 years. The scholastic exercises at this institution are substantially the same as in the public schools, with a study hour before breakfast and added hours during the week and on Saturdays, for those who have not exercised proper diligence at the proper time. The school is divided into two departments: In the higher are taught reading, spelling, and defining, arithmetic -- mental and written -- geography, writing and grammar. The manner of teaching writing and grammar is in a practical way. All communications with the superintendent and teacher in the school-room, reports of monitors, committees, &c., are written. This writing is then so marked as to indicate all inaccuracies and returned for correction, when a written answer is given. This is required of all in this department, and has been attended by the most gratifying results -- inducing a readiness and correctness of expression, in many cases, truly remarkable. There is also a class in YOUNG's Government Class Book, treating of the principles of Constitutional Government and the rights and duties of citizens. The Primary Department is devoted exclusively to elementary exercises. There has been but little sickness in the institution during the year and not one death.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5db09e7f-9601-582b-9cc6-d23e8e97d98d,650,nyt://article/5db09e7f-9601-582b-9cc6-d23e8e97d98d,

If a census of canards were taken in Europe at any moment of supreme importance to the legitimate dynasties, it would be found that the most obstructive and restrictive Cabinets of the Continent are of all the most prolific in this kind of production. During the Crimean war the wildest inventions which startled the West, from the Tartar courier, with his news of the sudden fall of Sebastopol, onward, were traced directly to the autocratic regions of the East. Austria and Naples, outdid all the rest of Europe put together in manufacturing current stories of the campaign of 1859 in Italy, and the same Powers have fairly flooded the telegraphs and Presses of the World with extraordinary intelligence since the peace of Villafranca. We owe to them now the interesting information that the Emperors of Austria and Russia are shortly to have a meeting at Warsaw, after the fashion of Baden and Toplitz, and that the policy of the Czar has once more begun to shape itself in harmony with the interests of the Kaiser. ALEXANDER II., we are told, has resolved to abandon the course pursued by him since the peace of Paris, and to resume the important office of grand beadle of Europe, which was so long held by his proud and peremptory father. The autocrat of all the Russias, it is averred, has at last discovered the peril to himself and his successors involved in a triumph of the revolutionary principles which GARIBALDI represents, and he has accordingly made up his mind to exchange the alliance of imperial and subversive France, without whose aid and countenance GARIBALDI might now be melting candles on Staten Island instead of setting Italy in a blaze, for a renewed intimacy with absolutist Austria, the prop and hope of divine right in these disastrous days.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Austria and Russia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Austria and Russia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9de4e0c2-d05c-5b95-9b0d-7b0cb3c9e036,1264,nyt://article/9de4e0c2-d05c-5b95-9b0d-7b0cb3c9e036,

Among the contracts awarded on the 30th ult., in the Street Commissioner's Department, there was one which, while it was the largest awarded in that Department during this year, is also one of the most important to residents in the upper part of the island. The contract is for regulating and grading the Eighth-avenue from Eighty-second to One Hundred and Second-street, and was awarded to GEORGE A. BUCKINGHAM, & CO., at $34,201 77. It embraces 51,000 cubic yards of stone-cutting, and the same amount of filling, with the necessary stone culverts, &c., and the work is to be completed in eighteen months. The avenue, from Fifty-ninth to Eighty-second-street has been under contract for a year to OSCAR TAYLOR, and from One Hundred and Second-street to One Hundred and Four-teenth-Street, to CORNELIUS SMITH, both of whom are pushing forward the work. When the middle section shall have been completed from Eighty-second-street to One Hundred and Second-street, the Eighth-avenue will become the main artery for travel on the western side of the Island, and the Eighth-avenue Railroad Company will gladly avail itself of the completion of the work, to extend their road to Harlem. The present work was awarded last year to a party who finding he had taken a losing job, abandoned the contract and it had to be readvertised. The present contractors are largely engaged in regulating and grading streets, and it is to be hoped that this important work will be pushed to completion with all possible speed.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8626df1-51d0-5d96-a2e9-93c4e2e9d6c4,1422,nyt://article/a8626df1-51d0-5d96-a2e9-93c4e2e9d6c4,

It was supposed that the Chairman of the Breckinridge State Central Committee, Mr. JNO. A. GREENE, who has lately arrived from Washington, where he has been in consultation with the President and with the National Executive Committee, had come prepared with an ultimatum for the consideration of the Douglas men, and that the only question in the negotiations would be its acceptance or rejection by them; but it seems that nothing definite was agreed to at Washington, the President having expressed the opinion that he had sufficient confidence in the Breckinridge men of this State to leave the terms of the bargain to their discretion, assuring them that, in case they could not form an honorable union with their opponents, he would back up their forces as an independent organization, with all the patronage of Government. Thus left to their discretion the Breckinridge Committee find it difficult to make their opponents believe that the discretion is a sound one, or that the terms which it proposes are either just or honorable. The Breckinridge Party, demanded ten men on the Electoral ticket. The Douglas men, while asserting that their strength in the State does not entitle them to more than one, nevertheless offer them four. It was rumored that at the last conference, yesterday afternoon, they even went so far as to offer them six; but the Brecks would not budge from their Original stand, and the consequence was that nothing was done. The Breckinridge Committee met at the Astor House at o'clock, (15 out of the 16 members being present,) when they were handed a communication from the Douglas Committee informing them that BENJAMIN WOOD, JOHN A. KENNEDY and Mr. CLAFFLIN had been appointed to confer with them, and that they would be happy to receive any committee they might be pleased to appoint, at Delmonico's. They immediately appointed JOHN A. GREENE of Syracuse, A.H. MILLER of Tioga, and THADDEUS P. MOTT of New-York, to confer with the Douglas Committee, and report the result at the Astor House at 3 o'clock. The conference was had, and the result reported, but as the latter was not satisfactory, the Committee, instructed them to hold another conference and report at 8 o'clock in the evening. At 8 o'clock the Committee met again, heard the report, and after discussing the matter for two hours adjourned, without coming to any decision, to 10 o'clock this morning.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY POLITICS.; The Anti-Republican Fusion.

Such demonstrations can only emanate from an American who fancies it for his interest, or mistakes it for his duty, to grovel a little deeper in the dust than English subjects are expected to do, and who makes still further ostentation of his devotion by vehemently reproaching everybody who declines to imitate his example. We neither know nor care a straw about the authorship of the Albion's tirade, -- nor have we given that print any occasion for its intimation that we have spoken from any knowledge of its internal arrangements. We knew from the articles themselves, -- from their tone and temper, -- that they were written by somebody who was affecting sentiments he did not feel, -- and who was an Englishman only for the time being and for a consideration. The Albion's reply is a confession that we were correct in our conjecture.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEEDLESS EXCITEMENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEEDLESS EXCITEMENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/08768ac3-fd22-537d-9c09-eff62df3821f,255,nyt://article/08768ac3-fd22-537d-9c09-eff62df3821f,

To give the Prince a ball may seem to the unthinking reader a very simple matter. It is only to subscribe so much money, hire the Academy of Music, purchase an indefinite number of bouquets, engage Dodworth's Band, and lo! thing is done. The unthinking reader, if such be his notions, is just as wide of the mark as usual. Bouquets, bands, dancing-floors and committees go but a small way towards the composition of a ball. After these are all provided, comes the dread necessity of inviting your company -- a task not always pleasant or easy to the private amphitryon, and to a public committee the source of ""woes unnumbered.""

To inclose the City Hall Park, board it over, and cover it with a tent, would scarcely offer space for one-third of the people who think themselves, and are thought by their neighbors, likely to ensure the dignity and to enhance the brilliancy of a festive entertainment by their presence.

"-- The sages and philosophers of the Tribune office, having worked their way to what they no doubt consider respectable height in public esteem, with truly philosophic prudence seem to be making arrangements for a safe and easy descent from that eminence to the level to which they evidently fear they must soon be brought. Yesterday afternoon, a large crowd collected in front of the establishment, and betrayed, by eager upward glances, an expectation of something unusual to happen within or upon that philanthropic pile. At precisely 4 o'clock, when the curiosity of the multitude had reached its height, a window was opened in the upper story of the building, and an iron crane swung therefrom, having a stout rope attached. The apparatus bore so close a resemblance to the gibbet on which traitors are hung, that its design was at once suspected among the spectators to be the capital punishment by strangulation of some political traitor within. The surprise of the throng may be ""more easily described than imagined"" when, instead of a white coat and soiled boots, encasing the retired partner of a ""political firm,"" a small boy with a ragged jacket, and no shoes, was thrust through the wind wand into the noose, which was not, however, placed about his neck, but under his arms, as in the case of the Paddy, who requested the Sheriff ""not to fumble about his neck, as he was so ticklish there he'd die laughing."" By an arrangement of wheels and gears attached to the crane, the small boy descended, at a comfortable rate of velocity, which he was enabled to regulate by the manipulation of a clasp about the rope held in his hand. This descent was followed by numerous other aspirants from the crowd ascending the stairs for that purpose, until the candidates for this sliding scale of honor became so numerous that the proprietor of the machine was compelled to refuse applicants, and so the exhibition closed. Of course there were skeptics, as usual, in the crowd, who did not believe that the apparatus had been provided to break the fall of politicians who have climbed too high. Some of these insisted that the whole thing was gotten up by the inventors of a new fire-escape, by which a person descending could regulate his own rate of speed.

These instantly fell upon and knocked him down, after which they kicked and beat him.

SUYDAM STATHOFF, FREDERIC HUFAD, E.H. GARBUTT, E.B. DANA. In place of the usual Essay, a discussion was had upon the duty of the Society towards the inmates of the various public institutions, and with this view, Mr. BEAL, the agent of the Prison Association was invited to be present. Mr. BEAL came forward and said that he was not a speaker, but a worker, and he came to inform them as to the prisons in this country. Crime appears to be seriously on the increase, and regretted the want of time to prepare some statistics. Mr. BEAL then read extracts from prison reports, showing that in 1856 70,950 persons were put into the prisons of New-York and Brooklyn, and the number had greatly increased every year since. Of those arrested during the last year 24.797 were intemperate, and there were thousands of temperate prisoners there who drink occasionally. He then referred to the condition of the prisoners. They are at first placed in a house of detention, where there is no one to care for their souls. Not less than 50,000 men and women will be incarcerated during the present year, without any facilities for washing, and their condition is fairly deplorable. There are no books. This is universally the case. There is a lack of moral appliances in all prisons, and still it is expected that prisoners will come out and walk correctly. The Raymond-street jail, he considered one of the worst prisons in the State of New-York. One or two friends go there on the Sabbath, but there is no sermon, but there ought to be a chapel and sermons there. Persons are imprisoned for years without hearing the Gospel. This should not be, for prisoners are made as we are. This association, he said, was admirably adapted to this work. He was aware that these institutions were under political influence, but he regretted it. It was the duty of every christian to go to the polls and elect good men to take charge of our penal institutions. Mr. BRACE related several incidents in relation to prisoners who had been reformed by kindness. JAMES MCKILLOP, chaplain of the Kings County Penitentiary for the last four years, then spoke of the necessity there was for religious instruction in that institution. Mr. THEODORE TILTON followed in an able address upon the general subject. The meeting was well attended, and considerable interest was manifested, but no decided action was taken.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/540b7fe8-af84-52c9-a302-df1540b3a82f,572,nyt://article/540b7fe8-af84-52c9-a302-df1540b3a82f,

The natural impulse of every honest citizen of New-York in such an emergency, is to suspect some personal passion or some political necessity as the governing spring of the Mayoral action. An appeal against perjury made by TITUS OATES, or a homily against ambition from AARON BURR, would hardly have commanded a more incredulous audience than an advocacy of municipal interests in the mouth of Mr. FERNANDO WOOD. This is a thing to be regretted, certainly, for the sake of the Metropolis, since we are saddled hopelessly with a general responsibility for Mr. WOOD and his ways.

"Notwithstanding the recent outbreak among the convicts at Sing Sing State Prison, it is neither just nor charitable to punish a thousand men for the misdeeds of a few, nor to withhold from the great majority the means of self-improvement. It may not have occurred to the officers of the Prison that the difficulties with which they frequently have to contend, in reducing their charges to order, are, perhaps, due to the mental destitution of the prisoners. During working-hours,  it is quite possible to enforce discipline and govern the unruly, for the stated requirements of hard labor tend to divert moody thoughts into other channels, and the exercise of the perceptive qualities of the brain readily displaces that of the reflective. Yet there are times in the life of every convict, just as there are moments in all men's lives, when the requirements of task-masters end, and the man begins to think. The prisoner's Sundays hang heavily on his hands, and the hour of daylight which remains to him after the monotonous labor of the other six days, is equally tedious and lonely. That a criminal, destitute of any means of recreation, should improve these opportunities to devise mischief, is no more surprising than for an idle boy to become a prisoner in his turn. It is, therefore, a matter for sincere congratulation that Mr. TILTON's recent appeal in behalf of the State's prisoners is found to have met a hearty and most liberal response. Acting upon the representations of Mr. LUCKEY and other officials, who had urged the expediency of providing mental aliment for the convicts, this appeal invited contributions in aid of the establishment of a Prison Library, which should be freely tendered for the use of the inmates at Sing Sing. We learn that some fifteen hundred volumes have already been given for this purpose, and that donations are still arriving daily. A liberal present of $100 has also been made for the same object by Mr. WM.H. ASPINWALL -- an excellent example for others of our merchants. The contributions already received will form the nucleus of a library, from the free use of which the best results may be hoped. That the prisoners will eagerly avail themselves of their enlarged privilege, is sufficiently indicated by the avidity with which they have read and reread the few volumes that have heretofore occupied the shelves under the chaplain's charge; and that the reformatory influence of this charity will be partially visible, at least, it requires no argument to prove. The right sort of Prison Reform is that which develops the better nature of the convict, -- not that which debases him into a brute, or governs him by terror.

The irresistible logic of the times in which we live has at last driven the Austrian Government into a position from which nothing but a decisive resolution for life or death can extricate it.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/12/archives/austria-and-hungary.html,,"The irresistible logic of the times in which we live has at last driven the Austrian Government into a position from which nothing but a decisive resolution for life or death can extricate it. In the face of the news which we publish to-day from Vienna, all speculations upon the probability of a violent Austrian intervention in the affairs of Italy flagrantly assume the absurdity which we have steadily fixed upon them. The domestic affairs of the Empire of FRANCIS JOSEPH have reached a crisis which makes all thought of a demonstrative foreign policy, for the present at least, impossible. The conviction has become universal throughout the Austrian States, from the Pruth to the Adige, that the day for stifling the constitutional aspirations of the Provinces united under the Apostolic sceptre has hopelessly gone by, and that if the imperial dynasty means to escape the fate which has overtaken the Bourbons in France, Spain and Italy, it must resolutely put itself at the head of the liberal drift of the nation. Gen. BENDEK, the most loyal of Hungarian magnates and Austrian officers, has requested the Emperor to relieve him of his post of Governor-General in Hungary, since he finds it impossible for him to carry out any coercive measures against the spirit of his fellow-countrymen. The majority of the Reichrath, or Council of the Empire -- a deliberative body recently reconstituted, for the purpose of helping the Emperor to organize his dominions on a tenable system -- have adopted the programme of the Hungarian leaders, demanding a complete domestic independence for every State of the Empire, and a federative government for the whole. The centralization experiment of Prince SCHWARTZENBERG has utterly failed, and the attempt to parody on the Austria of 1860 the experience of the France of RICHELIEU and LOUIS XIV. has ended in the irresistible outbreak of a Congress of nationalities demanding justice, freedom and internal developments. A compromise between the views of this formidable majority and the obstinate illusions of the Court party has been brought forward by a section of the Hungarian nobility; but it is understood that this compromise will find no favor with the people of any considerable portion of the Empire, and that if any attempt is made seriously to evade the exigencies of the moment by palliatives and half-measures, the Hungarian Councilors will retire in a body, making a formal and conspicuous protest, and that a general explosion will follow throughout the Empire, from Crotia to the Tyrol.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Austria and Hungary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Austria and Hungary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7d70a675-9920-5c11-a18f-09322be4bff4,663,nyt://article/7d70a675-9920-5c11-a18f-09322be4bff4,

"details of the loss of the steamboat Lady Elgin come tardily. Little else is ascertained than that at 3 1/2 o'clock on Saturday morning, when off Waukegan, and about thirteen miles from land, she was run into by a schooner called the Augusta, and that in twenty minutes the steamer sunk, carrying down nearly all of some three hundred and fifty or four hundred passengers. The night is represented as being extremely dark and rainy, the wind blowing a gale, and the schooner under great headway. That the steamer showed lights sufficient to have notified the sailing vessel of her whereabouts, may be inferred from the fact that parties were dancing and music playing in the saloon at the moment of collision. As to the means of rescue provided upon the sinking vessel, it would seem that a sufficient number of life-preservers were supplied; and that three boats, capable of saving fifty persons, and which did actually land thirty in safety, were on board. These are all the facts bearing directly upon the question, of the responsibility for the accident, which have reached us, and upon evidence thus slight it would be the extreme of rashness to pronounce sentence of guilty of an event so fearful in its consequences upon any possible parties. It is painfully evident, however, that the provision for safety upon the steamer, would have left a multitude to perish had the weather been calm, and the hour mid-day, so sudden was her fate. Whether any precautions for safety would have availed under such awful conditions as those which the doomed vessel, thus heavily freighted with life, and exposed to risk in the crowded waters of Lake Michigan, actually encountered, is a point yet to be cleared up by the investigation of the Coroner.

Heretofore, and upon manifold occasions, that candid leader has avowed his aversion to entangling alliances, and especially emphasized his hostility to any conciliation with the adherents of Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. He has excommunicated all Democrats who declined the test of loyalty to the Cincinnati Platform; exposed the disunionist tendencies of the Southern conspirators in whose hands Mr. BRECKINRIDGE permits himself to be a passive, and professes to be an unconscious, tool; and in thus defining the position of the schismatics has shown that covenants with them are politically and morally impossible. We are obliged to assume, what we conceive to be absurd, that Mr. DOUGLAS has forgotten his acknowledged craft as a politician, in the ardor of his private animosity against the Southern leaders; or else admit that his earnestness upon these points is the fruit of sincere convictions, which he will never consent to sacrifice on the altar of temporary expediency. But, notwithstanding these clear expressions of his views elsewhere, a portion of his friends in this State appear to have been persuaded that New-York might be made an exception to the Senator's general principle; that the prize of the Empire State might be sufficiently tempting to relax the rigor of political sentiments, which so seldom are found to resist the inducements of those gentle casuists, the friends of a candidate. It was hoped that in his New-York speech, to be delivered at Jones' Wood, symptoms of this conciliatory and compliant temper would be found, thus enabling the diplomatists who have thus far conducted the negotiations between the dissenting factions, to procure the final and sufficient sanction of the Committees, and so consolidate a trinity of discordant and repulsive factions in opposition to the Republicans.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Douglas and Fusion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Douglas and Fusion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/57c12b7c-3ad9-5164-aa99-504b01d6d4e7,841,nyt://article/57c12b7c-3ad9-5164-aa99-504b01d6d4e7,

The National Guard Band was engaged for the occasion, and long before the hour for beginning the exercises, discoursed inviting music from the stand inside the inclosure. The children were there also at an early hour, to the number of over two hundred, tidily dressed, who rollicked, frolicked, danced and marched over the grounds, waiting for their friends and the needful quarters to come in. The day, however, was inauspicious, and few except some old familiar friends of the Home found their way through the gusty, dusty streets, to the place of exhibition. At the hour designated for the exercises to begin not over fifty or sixty persons had assembled, the large majority being ladies. Nothing discouraged, however, Mr. BARLOW, the Superintendent of the Institution, proceeded with the programme, which consisted of singing by the children, interspersed by music from the band. The principal features of the entertainment were the performance of several very clever tricks of magic and attempts at ventriloquism by Mr. BACON, who is connected with the Sunday School. Two bright little girls, named KATE and LENA FOX, were introduced by Mr. BARLOW, and a brief but touching history given of the circumstances under which he found them, living in a miserable garret in Leonard-street, their mother having died, and the father being incapable, from drunkenness, of providing for them.

"The Douglas Democrats held a large meeting at Jones' Wood yesterday. The ""Grand Political Carnival and Ox-roast,"" so extensively advertised, drew together an assemblage of from 20,000 to 30,000 people. The monstrous blue eagle in the poster, that stared citizens in the face from every board fence and new brick wall, from whose beak streamed the pleonastic placard, ""Popular Sovereignty of the People, was not limned for nothing. Early in the day the beef-eating Democrats began to gather without the inclosure from which the viands were to be dispensed. The native voters and the unnaturalized votaries of the party on empty stomachs wended to the Wood, and awaited the feast for which they had reserved their appetites. But disappointment waits on expectation. Of all those who for hours stood there in hungry anticipation, comparatively few obtained a dinner. An ox, a sheep, a calf, and a hog, were the sacrifices by which the people were sought to be propitiated. The ox, it is said, weighed 2,200 pounds before it was slaughtered, and was from Kentucky. All were presented by New-York butchers, and were killed on Monday. At 6 P.M. on that day the cooking commenced. In a trench sixteen feet long, eight feet wide, and five feet deep, lined with stone, a fire was built, and when the heat became intense the ox spitted on a young hickory tree, forty-eight feet long, was laid across the hole. Every now and then the spit was turned, that the meat might be equably roasted on all sides. The fire occupied only a portion of the bottom of the trench. On the other part tin pans were laid, in which the juice of the meat was caught. Into these the necessary condiments were thrown, and the cooks, with long dippers, poured the gravy thus seasoned upon the beef. With long-handled pitchforks they supported the huge roasting piece when it needed support, and from time to time tested the tenderness of the side turned towards the fire. The veteran PALMO was chief cook, and four assistants divided his labors. Councilman CAMPBELL had the general superintendence of the barbecue. The cooking of the ox occupied twelve hours, and was completed early yesterday morning. The other animals were first prepared for food.

The Celts, and especially the Paddy variety of the species, have faults enough to answer for, but there is something exquisite in the ignorance which gravely reprehends them for the misdeeds of Orangemen. The truth is that the men who have been recently pouring out the vials of their partisan wrath upon the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Newcastle, are of as purely and thoroughly English, or Anglo-Saxon breed, as any Massachusetts Yankee or Virginia planter. They are the descendants of English colonists, planted in Ireland at a period as recent as, and even more so, than that of the settlement of New-England, and they have been infinitely less exposed than any of the North American colonists to intermixture with any other race. With the exception of a few dozen French Huguenots, Englishmen and Lowland Scotch are the only strangers who have ever settled in Ireland; and so far from being Celts, it has been the pride and boast of Orangemen, for half-a-dozen generations, that no Irish Catholic blood ever mingled with the pure Protestant current in their veins. The fact of any one in the least familiar with Irish history during the last three hundred years, holding up the follies of Orangemen as an illustration of the inherent absurdity and indiscretion of the Celtic race, is about as absurd as pointing to an encounter with bowie knives between two Mississippian doctors, as a proof the irreclaimable babarism of the Choctaws or Sioux.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Orangeism at Home.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Orangeism at Home.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Ireland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8d4f1892-4802-57ba-ac85-4e44ab845172,1122,nyt://article/8d4f1892-4802-57ba-ac85-4e44ab845172,

The choir responded, ""This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter therin."" The Trustees of the congregation then entered, bearing the scrolls of the Law handsomely decorated with silver ornaments. They made seven circuits of the building, the Reader and choir chanting a different hymn at each circuit. The ark was then opened, and the perpetual lamp lit.

Prior to listening to the speeches, the Kentucky ox, the calf, the sheep and the hog, which had been roasted whole, were devoured by the multitude, in the open field, with apparent relish. When the meats had been disposed of, Messrs. DOUGLAS and JOHNSON spoke from the main stand to a vast concourse of people. There was nothing new in either of the speeches. Both were determined to ""stand by the Union, the Constitution, the enforcement of the laws, and non-intervention."" In relation to the fusion movement, Mr. DOUGLAS said, in answer to a question, that when Mr. BRECKINRIDGE answered the question put to him (Mr. DOUGLAS) at Norfolk, and by it showed himself to be a staunch Union man, it would be time enough to talk of fusion. Several speeches were made by much less important men at other stands. During the evening Messrs. DOUGLAS and JOHNSON were serenaded at the Fifth-avenue Hotel.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf27d2dc-dbfd-5833-b2e1-444034a8430b,1268,nyt://article/cf27d2dc-dbfd-5833-b2e1-444034a8430b,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/14/archives/a-series-of-robberies-by-a-dry-goods-clerk-his-weakness.html,,"JOHN S. BRUSH, a fashionably-attired individual, aged 19, was brought before Justice BRENNAN yesterday, on a charge of having stolen a quantity of stella and broche shawls from Messrs, MILLS RAY, importers, at No. 318 Broadway. It was stated that the accused for eight months past had been employed as entry clerk by the complainants, and that the robberies had been perpetrated in the interval between the 10th of June last and the 7th inst. During this time the shawls have disappeared from the store in large quantities, and the merchants had no doubt that one of their clerks was the thief, but every effort on their part failed to discover the delinquent. Recently the matter was brought to the attention of Officer GOLDEN, of the Sixth Ward, who soon obtained information which led him to watch particularly the movements of young BRUSH, and a night or two since, having followed him through various streets, the policeman saw him enter Odd Fellow's Hall in Centre-street, where he remained a short time. When he came from the saloon GOLDEN noticed that BRUSH brought out with him a bundle, which he did not have before, and seeming to exercise much caution in his actions, he went to PECARE's pawn-office in Grand-street, near Mott, where he rang the bell of the private door. The officer, in plain clothes, obtained admission to the establishment at the same time, pretending that he wanted to pledge his watch, and thus satisfied himself as to the contents of the young man's package. This accomplished, he engaged in conversation with the youth, and having invited him to take some refreshments, beguiled him into the Station-house. When the knowledge that he had been trapped dawned upon the young man's mind, he became very indignant, and protested his innocence of any crime. Finally, however, he made a full confession of the robberies. He stated that he had stolen as many as sixty-one shawls from his employers, and that the aggregate value of that property was about $600. These goods he had disposed of at thirteen pawn-offices for sums by no means equivalent to their value. For at least ten days previous to his arrest he had taken four shawls each day, all of which he hnd disposed of at PECARE's. His manner of bringing the articles from the store was to wind them around his body, beneath his shirt, and it was a very easy thing to find a place wherein he could take the goods from their concealment when he wanted to do so. Upon the information thus obtained, Officer GOLDEN has already recovered thirty-eight of the shawls, and the remainder, it is thought, will also be obtained. Thirteen of the shawls were found in PECARE's establishment, and he denied that he had any more in his possession, strengthening his statement by exhibiting his books, which show that the others had been redeemed by BRUSH. The latter denies, however, having ever redeemed one of them. BRUSH, among his other confessions, stated that the extravagant demands of a young woman with whom he had been intimate, compelled him to commit the robberies. A quiet little supper together had often cost him $20 each, and a running account which he kept at a livery-stable demonstrated that a week's bill for horses several times amounted to $40. His salary of $350 per annum, of course, was insufficent for a person of such luxurious habits, and he entered upon his career of dishonesty to make up the deficiency. The magistrate required the friends of the prisoner, who are persons of respectability, to furnish bail for his appearance to answer at the Court of General Sessions.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Series of Robberies by a Dry Goods Clerk.; HIS WEAKNESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Series of Robberies by a Dry Goods Clerk.; HIS WEAKNESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/230b9e50-00d6-5691-8bd8-fc6cce86b701,612,nyt://article/230b9e50-00d6-5691-8bd8-fc6cce86b701,

At any other period than the last year of the presidential term, Mr. LINCOLN's legal or political pursuits would be considered alone worthy of admiration, because the wonder really is, not that he should ever have split rails, but that having once been obliged to split rails for a livelihood, he should now be a successful lawyer. It is as a lawyer alone that he is really a marvel. It is not improbable that during the period of his career in which he wielded the maul and axe, Mr. LINCOLN being unable to procure new clothes as often as he needed them, may have mended his own pantaloons.

Ten years ago, it says, a father in the Church discussing the pressing needs of the American Board, declared that a revival of religion, and that only, could give a fresh impulse to the missionary work. The great awakening which was so ardently desired has come, its power has passed by, and what is the result? From 1848 to 1851, a period of four years, the receipts of the Board were $1,072,000; from 1852 to 1855, $1,233,000 -- an increase of about three per cent. per annum; from 1856 to 1859, inclusive, $1,381,000, or an increase of only 2 1/2 per cent. per annum. Are these results, it asks, equal to the anticipations which were entertained? The Churches, in connection with the American Board, shared as largely as any in the work of grace; but its receipts last year were less by one-tenth than during the year which preceded the Pentecostal rain.

JOHNSON, of Georgia, denounced the existence of a design on the part of the South, to dissolve the Union in a ""certain contingency,"" the report proceeds to say that the announcement was received by a previously boisterous audience, in profound silence, and the reader is left to the presumption that awe and horror were the source of the transition. We suspect that no sentiment so profound was in the least concerned. The change had its origin doubtless in the curiosity of the hearers -- in their natural desire to court further developments, and in their anxiety to understand the exact nature of the contingency in which these anonymous conspirators will rush to the achievement of their undefined purposes. There is a mystery about this much-mentioned plot of impending Disunion which very naturally excites attention, even where it fails to inspire apprehension; and it strikes us that the time has fully come when we should know more of the dreadful things prepared for an evil and perverse generation at the hands of the ""united South."" The advocates of three Presidential Candidates have now distinctly asserted that the election of Mr. LINCOLN is the contingency referred to -- the cardinal pivot upon which the second American revolution is to hinge. A correspondent of a city print states that at a meeting last week of former supporters of Mr. DOUGLAS in Virginia, men of substance and intelligence, assembled at no more obscure a place than the White Sulphur Springs, it was resolved to abandon that candidate, because he had publicly declared at Norfolk his conviction that the election of LINCOLN would not justify the South in secession. The leaders of the disunion movement at the South, the RHETTS, the YANCEYS, and the DAVISES, who, for the moment, sustain Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, and in sustaining him avow their allegiance to the existing Union, disavow at the same time all allegiance to a Union of which LINCOLN, and not BRECKINRIDGE, shall be the federal head. These indications, if they have any meaning, demonstrate a settled and mischievous purpose on the part of these desperate political gamesters; and it is but equitable that the country, upon whose conduct the event depends, should know the precise condition in which it stands, and the nature and full extent of the penalty to be paid for a certain course of action. It is more than probable, indeed, that the result, so far as popular action is concerned, will not now be altered by the disclosure; but we may at least be placed upon equal terms with our antagonists, and the Federal authority may have some chance to assert itself. If the persons suspected of complicity in these purposes care to avoid the undesirable fame of GUY FAUX and FIESCHI, they will throw aside their slouched hats and cloaks, and let the intended victim recognize the intending assassin.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Certain Contingency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Certain Contingency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3f66d2a2-b7c2-56cd-b7a5-f82a8d03dd5d,1091,nyt://article/3f66d2a2-b7c2-56cd-b7a5-f82a8d03dd5d,

She left Liverpool on Wednesday, the 5th inst. The intelligence is highly important. Sardinia was about to interfere in Neapolitan affairs, and it was reported that Gen. LA MARMORA was to leave for Naples with thirty thousand troops -- the object being, as stated in our dispatch, ""to prevent Naples from becoming a prey to anarchy in view of the fall of the Bourbon Dynasty."" All the disposable vessels of the Sardinian Navy were to be sent to the scene of operations, and the military preparations were being prosecuted with the utmost vigor. Every available transport was being put into service, and the Pope would be asked to allow the passage of troops through his dominions in case it should be found impossible otherwise to move so large a body of troops with sufficient rapidity. Meantime insurrections continued, the Province of Terra di Lavoro having revolted, and large bodies of insurgents being in motion. A communication had been received at Naples from GARIBALDI stating that he would be there about the 8th to assume the Dictatorship. From China we learn that on June 26 hostilities were about to commence at the Pei-ho. The statement relative to the mission of Mr. LINDSAY to the United States is qualified somewhat by the London Observer.

The Times enumerates the benefits that the French population of the Province have derived from British rule; and they are so far correctly stated that there is probably no dependency of the British Crown more favored at the present day than that of Lower Canada. Every effort has been made to conciliate her people -- their national prejudices have been respected, their language has been preserved, and their religion has been placed on a footing of perfect equality with that of the Episcopal establishment. If Lower Canada had remained a French colony, it could not have been as politically free as it is now; if it had been absorbed by the United States, or by the English colonies that sweep around it, the anomaly of an unprogressive Province in the centre of the North American Continent would not be witnessed, nor would a crop of ungenial prejudice be found flourishing in the midst of an Anglo-Saxon empire. In the nature of things French Lower Canadian influence ought long ago to have been swamped; and it undoubtedly would have been swamped if it had not been for the protecting aegis of British Rule. Many people, on both sides of the line, imagine that the policy of the British Government in this respect has not proved beneficial to the best interests of Canada, and was not adopted and pursued from purely unselfish motives. The French population in Canada -- the most peaceful and contented probably in the world -- were once goaded to rebellion, and American sympathy, then displayed in their behalf, opened the eyes of the Home Government to the danger of having a discontented colony lying within the very shadow of the great Republic. Ever since 1838, the fullest liberty has been granted to the French Canadians. They have been allowed and encouraged to retain a nationality of their own, and their religion, especially, has been fostered. They dislike, at present, no people more than they do the Americans. They detest our democratic institutions, and dread nothing so much as an influx of American ideas, which would soon overturn the little idols they have set up to worship.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'French Canadianism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'French Canadianism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fa058569-2179-5408-83c5-87498970695b,795,nyt://article/fa058569-2179-5408-83c5-87498970695b,

"-- Joshua Shaw, the celebrated landscape painter, died at Burlington, N.J., on the 8th inst., at the advanced age of 83. He was born in Bellingbroke, Lincolnshire, England. Early left an orphan he was successively a farmer boy, post boy and apprentice to a country sign painter. Young Shaw found this last occupation the most congenial as he had greater opportunities to indulge his taste for painting, and by persistent effort he succeeded in bringing his name before the public, through the excellence of his landscapes. In 1817 he determined to remove to this country. He brought over with him the great picture which West executed and presented to the Pennsylvania Hospital, ""Christ healing the Sick.""

Improvements which he made in gun-locks were adopted by our Government, and according to statistics preserved in the Department at Washington, he was entitled to commissions amounting to $170,000. For many years he petitioned Congress for some substantial reward, and in 1848 an act was passed granting $25,000, provided that the Secretary of War considered the award equitable and just; $18,000 was allowed by the Secretary, and handed over to Mr. Shaw. The balance, $7,000, still remains unpaid, although Secretary Floyd has since decided the said balance to be justly due. The Secretary of the Treasury, however, declines payment, upon the ground that it has reverted to the surplus fund. The Emperor of Russia also awarded a premium to Mr. Shaw for improvements in naval warfare, and also promised a commission on his patents, which are extensively used throughout that Empire.

They were gallantly met by the cavalry of the enemy, but held their ground against the charge with great courage, until larger masses of their antagonists were flung upon them, and the conflict was converted into a rout.

Her husband immediately started in pursuit of Henry Kelly, the driver of the vehicle, who for some time past has been engaged to convey the lady to and from the theatre, but before Mr. Hoey reached the stable Kelly had put up his horses, and gone home. Not being able to ascertain where he lived, Mr. H. deferred further action until Saturday morning, when he learned that Kelly lived at No. 120 West Nineteenth-street. On going to his house, Mr. H. saw the satchel upon the mantel-piece and observed that the wife of the driver had one of Mrs. H.'s diamond rings upon her finger. Kelly was questioned as to his reason for not restoring the bag on the previous night, and he replied that he had intended to send it home in the morning. Upon examining the bag it was found that a portion of the jewelry, consisting of two diamond finger-rings, a diamond breast-pin and a diamond hair-pin, had been taken out, and Kelly refused to give any account of them. Mrs. H. thereupon quietly secured the services of Officer Hughes, of the Sixteenth Ward, who took Kelly into custody. After her husband's arrest, Mrs. Kelly gave up the ring, which she had on her finger, and said that the other ring and hair-pin were on the floor of the adjoining apartment, occupied by Thomas Cauldwell. Her statement was found to be correct, and only the brooch remained to be accounted for. Meantime Kelly had made the following confession to Mr. Hoey: Having found the bag in the coach he brought it home, fully intending to restore it in the morning. Before going to bed he went down stairs into the liquor store, and drank several glasses of ale with his neighbors, Thomas and Bernard Cauldwell. Subsequently the party went to his room and renewed their conviviality. During the time that they were drinking, Bernard took the satchel and picked the lock, but with what instrument Kelly was too drunk to see. Thomas Cauldwell then selected some of the jewelry for his daughter, and the others took what pleased them, and they separated for the night. The prisoner did not think anything more of the matter until he became sober and was arrested. Upon this information, the brothers Cauldwell were also apprehended, and the three prisoners were taken before Justice CONNOLLY, who committed them for trial, each in default of $1,000. The missing brooch was afterwards found, wrapped up in a piece of tin-foil, in the pocket of Thomas Cauldwell. In the examination of the accused before the magistrate, Kelly made a similar statement of the affair to that related by him to Mr. Hoey. Bernard Cauldwell admitted having picked the lock of the satchel, but said that he was requested to do it by Kelly, and Thomas Cauldwell refused to say anything at all about the matter.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Police Reports.; MRS.

Apropos of Swans, the newly imported birds, recently received by Mr. AUGUST BELMONT, from London, were in the lake, floating or at anchor, the observed of all observers. The mall was alive with gentry in gay garb; hundreds thridded the mazy windings of the Ramble; and the rumble, -- the appropriate name of the adjacent roads when countless wheels are plying over them; -- was so crowded with carriages and equestrians that life assurance companies might well receive the suggestion that they should require of all who pay them premiums that they will never cross it of a Saturday afternoon in concert-time. It was worth one's vital spark to navigate there on foot yesterday. The concert was good; the Police arrangements admirable; the temper of the people amiable; and order in an excellent state of preservation.

It seems now that CORTESI has seceded, and, with a wing of the operatic army, embracing MUSIANI and AMODIO, with ANSCHUTZ as conductor, has gone over to Niblo's, where she will open a season on Tuesday, in ""Traviata,"" and will play on alternate nights with the great American tragedian, Mr. FORREST. We are, therefore, to see, as in the Spring, a repetition of the operatic war of the rival roses, which, however amusing to the public, must end, of course, in the ruin of one or both the contending houses. The upshot of this sort of thing will be to make operatic enterprise so perilous as to do a fatal injury to art. The opening of two rival operas in London has had that effect, the competition raising the demands of artists to a point at which it was impossible for opera to ""pay."" The secession of the Cortesi party must, at this moment, seriously derange Mr. STRAKOSCH's plans and involve him in considerable difficulties He had, previously to the secession, engaged the Academy of Music at Philadelphia, and intended opening there on Monday with CORTESI. The duty of sustaining that branch must now rest with COLSON and PATTI, who is too tender and delicate a plant for such tough times. To-night STRAKOSCH brings out FABBRI, who led the opposition at the Winter Garden last Spring with so much brilliancy, and on her hang the fortunes of the house of STRAKOSCH and ULLMAN. If she fails to attract, who can prophesy that the sceptre of song will not once more pass into the hands of the indomitable MAX? In the meantime the burden of battle belongs to STRAKOSCH. His little companion is in Europe, building a number of castles most pleasant to look on at a distance, but which when touched are too often found to be but rosy fictions.

"The intelligence which reaches us to-day from Europe, by steamer at Quebec, makes it morally certain that GARIBALDI, at the head of his liberating army, must have entered the capital city of the Neapolitan mainland a fortnight since. On the 6th of September the victorious deliverer had reached Salerno, and from that picturesque and historical city, distant but a few hours by railway from the palaces of Naples, was organizing his forces for a triumphant entry upon the abandoned inheritance of the weakest and worst of the Bourbon dynasty. The telegram which carried this decisive news within a single day to the furthest corners of Europe carried with it the natural corollary that ""FRANCIS II. was preparing to take refuge at Gaeta."" For months before the death of FERDINAND great sums were expended by the Government upon the fortifications of this splendid and defensible harbor. Capua, the northern terminus of the railway leading from Naples in the direction of Gaeta, is also a strong and formidable post, and if the young Bourbon King had or could hope to have any party within his Kingdom, or any valuable support from abroad, his retreat upon the finest maritime fortress of his dominions might be regarded as postponing the hour of the final fall of his execrated House. But it is hardly possible that FRANCIS II. should have taken this step in the present posture of affairs, with any other purpose than to secure his leisurely escape from a country which he can no longer hope to rule in peace or honor. The presence at Naples of a powerful foreign force, including eight Sardinian men-of-war and two regiments of Sardinian bersaglieri, will doubtless have secured the quiet of the capital after the flight of the Government, and it is not probable that the entrance, of the liberal army was attended by any scenes of bloodshed, or even of disorder. It must not be forgotten, however, that FRANCIS II. at Gaeta is dangerously near the Papal frontiers. A brief day's march would put the Ex-King within the reach of Gen. DE LAMORICIERE's army, and if the son of FERDINAND should ask of PIUS IX. a return of the hospitality which that pontiff received, eleven years ago, from his Royal father, in similar circumstances, the Italian drama would receive a new and rather perplexing turn. Such an event is by no means impossible; and the next steamer from Europe will be expected with no ordinary impatience by those whose wishes and whose hopes go with the Italian people in their arduous and glorious movement towards independence, unity, and peace.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/18/archives/garibaldi-at-naples.html,,"The intelligence which reaches us to-day from Europe, by steamer at Quebec, makes it morally certain that GARIBALDI, at the head of his liberating army, must have entered the capital city of the Neapolitan mainland a fortnight since.

"THE SLAVE-TRADE. -- The British Anti-Slavery Society has issued another of its periodical lamentations, and, for a wonder, the subject discussed is not altogether of an impracticable nature. The Society having learned, possibly by experience, that appeals to the pocket are more forcible than appeals to the morality or humanity of a people, demonstrate to the British nation that, for forty years past, it has annually expended a million sterling in its endeavors to abolish the Slave-trade. Even the London Times is staggered at the aggregate expenditure of forty millions, sterling so hopelessly squandered; for it not only appears from the Society's report that the Slave-trade still lives in spite of every effort to suppress it, but, as far as Cuba is concerned, is carried out upon a scale quite as large as that which prevailed before its abolition was agreed upon by civilized nations. The remedy for the evil proposed by the Anti-Slavery Society is one which the British Government are unwilling to adopt, though it is notoriously the only practical one that has ever been suggested. The Society has requested Lord JOHN RUSSELL to demand of Spain the immediate cessation of the Slave-trade, or to intimate that Great Britain will require the reimbursement, with interest, of the &#194;&#163;;,400,000 compensation money, paid to Spain in 1817 for her discontinuance of the traffic, and the cessation of diplomatic intercourse. Doubts are entertained by the London Times whether Spain would either assent to the proposition or be much alarmed at the alternative. But such an objection can hardly be considered a valid one. The responsibility of continuing the Slave-trade, in defiance of public opinion throughout Christendom, belongs to Spain; and it is completely in the power of her Government to put a stop to the traffic whenever it pleases. Remonstrance has been ineffectual; but this is no reason why England should shrink from a duty that a specific treaty has imposed upon her. Until Spain has been made to feel the pressure indicated by the Anti-Slavery Society, it is premature for the Times to urge that that pressure would be unheeded. It ought, at least, to be tried by a Government which alone is in a position to make the experiment, and which is so earnest in its desire to see the Slave-trade abolished.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/18/archives/article-6-no-title.html,,"THE SLAVE-TRADE. -- The British Anti-Slavery Society has issued another of its periodical lamentations, and, for a wonder, the subject discussed is not altogether of an impracticable nature.

Much of this ocean of oratory was discharged last evening at the Cooper Institute, where there was an unprecedented rally of over-zealous friends of the Union and Constitution, to be instructed and strengthened by the exhortations of various partisan evangelists. The occasion was well improved. The addresses deserve the praise of producing some new and highly satisfactory variations upon that exhausted theme, Union-saving. Mayor WOOD, for example, placed before the eyes of the dazzled audience the figure of Commerce, surrounding it with a blaze of rhetorical and statistical fire-works, and traits of thorough reading, that must have misled an unprepared auditor into the belief that his Honor really knew something of the profound subject he was rashly discussing. No mistake could have been greater. The Mayor merely exalted the pecuniary goddess, to show in what constant danger she stood, environed as she is by the clamor of parties, and imperiled by thick-vollied threats of disunion. To appreciate the masterly facility with which Mayor WOOD handles these weighty matters, we need only refer to his statement that England borrowed free-trade from America; and, beaten in competition for the world's trade, she now looks to the event of the actual Presidential canvass, in the eager hope of seeing the Union dissevered and our commerce annihilated.

Hanley, an Irishman, was taken yesterday before Justice WELSH to answer a charge of having conducted himself in a disorderly manner on Sunday night, while he was intoxicated, and also for examination on the graver charge of having attempted a cowardly assault upon Mary McNulty, a domestic, employed at the hotel No. 77 Cortlandt-street. When his case was called on for examination, it was found that the woman McNulty had disappeared from Court. The Justice, therefore, imposed a fine upon the prisoner as the penalty for conviction of the minor charge, and he was committed to prison in default of paying the amount. Subsequently however, the young woman presented herself before the magistrate, and represented that she would have appeared sooner had not officer Miller, one of the attaches of the tribunal, detained her in conversation until Hanley's case was disposed of. He had implored her, she said, not to press the complaint, adding that the accused was a man of good family, and that she would be handsomely remunerated for her kindness if she consented to let the matter up easily. She had rejected all of Miller's overtures, and now expressed herself ready to make an affidavit against the prisoner, which she did, alleging that he had beaten her with his fists, and detailing the other particulars of the assault. Upon this complaint Hanley was detained to await an examination. At the suggestion of the magistrate, Miss McNulty also subscribed to a statement, in which was narrated the substance of what transpired at the interview between herself and the officer. The latter was interrogated on the subject by Justice WELSH, and he admitted the truth of the young woman's story. In explanation of his conduct, however, he stated that he believed the offence committed by the prisoner to be of a trivial character, and as he had known him for a long time, and he was a person for whom he entertained friendly feelings, he had been induced to make the effort for his release. From first to last, however, he had not had the slightest intention to interfere with the administration of justice. The magistrate was not satisfied with the explanation, and he suspended the officer from duty pending an inquiry into the facts. Miller is an old man, having served in the navy during the War of 1812. This is the first time that a complaint has been made against him.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/18/archives/police-reports-a-policeman-suspended-for-tampering-with-a-witness.html,,"Wm.

"The Committee of Councilmen who are considering the charges brought by the Mayor against Messrs. CRAVEN and TAPPAN, seem disposed to redeem the character of the parent Board. Precedent was not wanting to authorize an immediate decision against the accused, as soon as their unanswerable defence had been exhibited. Such a course would, we think, have been accepted by the public as in strict keeping with the antecedents of the Common Council; and neither surprise nor indignation would have been extracted from a community whose apathy is the natural result of persistent and uniform wrong-doing on the part of the civic legislature. These subdued expectations have been disappointed. The Committee has listened patiently to the defendants, and has gone so far on the direct route to justice, as to require the Mayor either to make good his charges or submit to have the innocence of his intended victims declared. Nor has the equitable temper of the tribunal ended in these manifestations. Senator WADSWORTH, whose direct or indirect concern in the conduct of the Croton Works must puzzle conjecture, has insisted on recognition as a prosecuting attorney against the accused. Unable to define his own connection with the case, and unwilling to disclose the names of the principals, for whom in this vexatious and frivolous business he has been induced to appear, Mr. WADSWORTH has been refused a hearing, the Committee very properly regarding their commission as restricted to the investigation of the Mayor's indictment; and believing that to obtain jurisdiction of other charges, they would have to obtain new powers from the Board. This course is at once regular, just and sensible. On every principle, Mr. WADSWORTH lacks standing before the Committee.

"AFFRAY ON SHIPBOARD -- A RUNNER DANGEROUSLY SHOT. -- Between 6 and 7 o'clock, last evening, a man named CHARLES LEONARD, who is by occupation a runner for a seaman's boarding-house, in West-street, was shot, it is thought mortally, by Capt. ADOLPH B. ELFSWORD, of the Swedish bark Maria Matilda, during the progress of an altercation between them on the deck of the vessel, at pier No. 6, North River. It is said that LEONARD visited the bark, and the captain; who had previously lost several of his men through the agency of the boarding-house runners, believing that the man had come to entice more of the crew away, ordered him to leave the ship. LEONARD reluctantly complied, first abusing Gapt. ELFSWORD in a very aggravating manner. He soon returned to the vessel, however, and coolly seated himself on the quarter-deck. This impudence on the part of the runner greatly enraged the Captain, who comanded that he should go on shore without further delay. Instead of obeying, LEONARD stopped to argue the matter, insisting that the Captain knew nothing of Ameeican law, and interspersing his remarks with offensive epithets. Unable longer to brook the insults of the ruffian, Capt. ELFSWORD procured a revolver and discharged one barrel of the weapon at him. The ball took effect in the man's thigh, and inflicted a wound which caused him to fall helplesss to the deck. The Captain at once went to the Sub-Station-house in Trinity-place and delivered himself into the custody of Capt. SILVEY, who detained him until to-day, when he will be taken before a magistrate.

Three minutes and forty seconds sufficed to get ready for action, and then two streams were thrown, one through an inch nozzle, and the other through a 1 1/2 inch nozzle, and both streams went over the pole, which is 186 feet high. Through a nozzle of 1 7-16 inches in diameter, a stream went above the pole about five feet. A similar trial was made in the Park in the afternoon, where Steam-engine No. 38 of this City was also present. A friendly test match between the two machines was talked of, but no arrangement for it was made. The exhibition attracted a large crowd, which included a good many firemen, several of whom were heard to speak favorably of the new ""steamer.""

Elfwerson, captain of the Swedish bark Maria Matilda, who surrendered himself into custody on Monday night after having shot Charles Leonard, a sailor boarding-house runner, was yesterday arraigned before Justice WELSH for examination. A partial inquiry into the facts connected with the case showed that Leonard and a number of other runners had induced several of Capt. Elfwerson's crew to desert. On Monday, evening Leonard went on board probably to decoy more of the sailors away, when he was ordered to go on shore. He obeyed, but soon returned to the vessel, and immediately a dispute occurred between him and the Captain, during which the latter was grossly insulted. In his excitement Capt. E. drew his pistol and shot the runner. The Magistrate fixed bail for the accused in the sum of $10,000 to await the result of Leonard's injury. Mr. James Boorman Johnson, of No. 56 Tenth-street, entered into the necessary bonds, and the Captain was discharged.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/20/archives/napoleon-iii-and-the-murats.html,,"The Emperor of the French is tormented, like other fortunate people, by needy and ambitious relations. His cousin, the Prince NAPOLEAN son of JEROME, has given him a world of trouble, by proving himself a most fretful soldier in time of peace, and a most laggard citizen in time of war, exciting all the disorganizing elements of French society by constant outbreaks of opposition to the policy of his imperial cousin, and seriously endangering the relations of France with the rest of Europe by his open intrigues for the Etrurian crown during the period of the Italian war. It is indeed asserted, and very positively, by persons who should be well informed, that the revelations with which Mr. KINGLAKE from time to time astounds the English House of Commons on the subject of the French Emperor's policy and intentions, come to that worthy gentleman from his intimate friend of the Palais Royal, and are intended to thwart and embarrass the Imperial action to the possible profit of Prince NAPOLEON. A new annoyance of the same kind has just been evoked by the critical position of the Neapolitan dynasty. Prince LUCIEN MURAT has advanced the most emphatic pretensions to the crown of the Two Sicilies, and having been rebuked by the official Moniteur, has replied in a justificatory letter, in which he assumes that if the popular vote of Naples should call him to the throne, the Emperor would be bound by his proclaimed policy of non-intervention to permit this new elevation of the House of Murat. The too aspiring representative of the soldier-king who failed the first NAPOLEON in his hour of need, forgets that he is now a French Prince, and that the consent of his imperial cousin, while it would not, of course, be necessary to his election by the people of Naples, would be absolutely essential to his acceptance of their proffered gift. This is a most important element in the calculations of the would-be successor of young BOMBA, and there can be small question that in the present state of European feeling, NAPOLEON III, will put a very decisive veto on any course of action which might for a moment warrant the Anti-Napoleonic parties of England and Germany in the supposition that he means to repeat the great error of his uncle's life, and set about tormenting Europe and embarrassing France with a network of petty Bonapartist monarchies. If Prince MURAT longs for a throne, he will do well to return to Florida, and take his chances in the chaos of our coming Southern Confederacy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Napoleon III. and the Murats.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Napoleon III. and the Murats.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c6ab0a4-873f-52a5-adbf-cd65b5c6a2fe,429,nyt://article/9c6ab0a4-873f-52a5-adbf-cd65b5c6a2fe,

The Quarterly Meeting of Teachers connected with the Sunday Schools of the Methodist Episcopal Church in this City, was held last night in the new and beautiful Church in Fourth-street, near Washington-square, at present occupied by the congregation formerly worshipping in the Sullivan-street M.E. Church. The building was crowded with teachers representing over twenty churches of this City, and the meeting was presided over by Mr. C.C. NORTH. The object of the meeting, which is held quarterly, is to discuss subjects connected with the Sunday-school cause, and to devise means for augmenting the usefulness of the Association. To this end questions are proposed for discussion by the teachers, and suggestions are offered as to the best means of increasing the number of attendants upon the schools and imparting the most thorough instruction, the meetings thus partaking of a colloquial character, in which any teacher may take part. The proceedings of last evening were opened by a hymn, exceedingly well sung by a large and thoroughly drilled choir, followed by a prayer by Rev. Mr. PUTNEY, of Williamsburgh, after which the exercises were opened for the discussion of the following subjects, in which many of the teachers took part: 1. ""Ought any but deeply pious persons be placed at the head of our classes?"" 2. ""Are our Anniversaries conducted on Christian or worldly principles?"" The Association represents some thirty Churches of the Methodist Episcopal persuasion, having in charge over 15,000 scholars, and from its first organization thirty-three years ago up to the present time, has continued to thrive and increase annually. The large attendance of last evening and the deep interest taken in the proceedings afford abundant evidence of the deep interest felt by those engaged in this good work.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; Polytechnic Association.

The first local development of Socialism, however, dates back through a period of twenty years. Free-Love, the bolder and more immodest phase of the Fourierite philosophy, is comparatively recent. Its progress has been remarkably rapid, -- either because the license which it permits is peculiarly suited to the disposition of the lower classes existent in a great city, or, as pietists will contend, from the proneness of mankind to commit wickedness. Be the reason what it may, the growth of this ulcerous abomination of unrestrained lust is constant, and is virtually unchecked by legal enactment or by the general condemnation of the community. Occasional raids of the Police force upon public places, like that which resulted in the discomfiture of the Free-Love League in the Fall of 1855, effect only a temporary diversion, -- the routed parties are quite sure of retaining a degree of vitality which enables them to reappear in a shape even more formidable and mischievous than before.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FREE LOVE.; Expose of the Affairs of the Late ""Unitary Household.""

At the meeting of the American Pharmaceutical Assocition, in this City, on the 11th inst., a paper was read by Mr. CARNEY, of Boston, on the frauds and deceptions practiced on the public by adulterations of drugs. The public have but little idea of the extent to which they are tampered with in this matter, nor would any intelligent community submit to the imposition were they once fully aware of the danger and risk they are exposed to. It is indeed a horrible thought that the very drugs we take to cure disease may be unconsciously but surely planting the seeds of death in our system. Adulterations he divided into three classes: 1. For making the drug more salable by improving its appearance by the addition of some body either innocuous or otherwise; 2. Depreciating the quality, by adding some substance which will diminish the real without altering the apparent strength or general appearance. This is generally a very deadly fraud. 3. Depreciating the quality and extending the quantity by the addition of some simple substance, as water; or, if a solid body, as sand, gypsum, &c. The past year has seen opium held at a high price, and in consequence a case of this article has been met with liberally charged with shot. All the shot that could be sold at $5 50 a pound, would be, of course, regarded as a mere pecuniary transaction, paying well; as a remedy, however, the opium would outweigh the lead in value. A specimen of nitrate of silver, also, sold by a New-York house for a pure article, contained but 30 per cent. of silver -- it should, if pure, have yielded 64 per cent. ""Pure chloroform"" has been found containing more than 12 per cent. of alcohol, and its specific gravity below 1.40. When remonstrated with, the vender said that the alcohol was necessary to preserve the chloroform!

A newsdealer, by the name of MARSH, for vending a few copies of the Tribune in Arkansas, was captured by a delegation from that State, tried and sentenced to be hung. Now, to circulate the Tribune may be a crime, very probably it is, yet it scarcely merits so severe a punishment as death at the hands of the hangman. At the worst it can only be construed as an error in taste and judgment, and as Mr. MARSH did not order the copies for personal perusal, but only to fill a special demand, the sin does not lie at his door. The gentlemen guilty of longing for the Tribune are certainly amenable to punishment, and as it might be difficult to point them out in so thickly settled a State as Arkansas, an indiscriminate hanging of the whole population would insure an individual retribution and subserve the ends of justice generally.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Minor Topics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Minor Topics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d53bfb3f-45b7-59c9-94a8-675d32fa913d,486,nyt://article/d53bfb3f-45b7-59c9-94a8-675d32fa913d,

A woman named WATSON, for example, was recently committed by Justice CONNOLLY as a vagrant: a few days after, a man appears, and presents an affidavit purporting to be made by PETER DE NOLLE, to the effect that he had long known her and her friends, -- that she lived in Newark, where she had a family, -- that this was her first offence, and that he desired to take her home. The affidavit purported to have been taken before ASA BUTMAN, Commissioner of Deeds, -- but it was evidently, signatures, and all, in the same handwriting. On the back was an order of Justice CONNOLLY, consenting to her discharge. The Commissioners, however, looked a little further into the matter, and on applying to the woman herself, found that she knew nothing whatever of DE NOLLE, had never lived in Newark, had no family and no home, and, in short, that the whole story was utterly false.

"The dwelling-house of Mr. JAMES BUCHAN, No. 376 Fourth-street, was visited by burglars on the night of the 11th inst., at which time the occupants were absent in the country, and robbed of a very considerable amount of property. The thieves gained access to the premises by wrenching the shutters from the rear windows of the basement, and then thoroughly ransacked the place. Among the property which they carried away was about $400 worth of clothing, some silver ware, and very nearly $44,000 in bonds and certificates of stock on various railroad and insurance companies. These bonds and certificates were the property of Mr. ADAM PEARSON, who is now traveling in Europe, and for whom Mr. BUCHAN is acting as agent. As soon as the robbery was discovered, which happened the day subsequent to its perpetration, printed descriptions of the bonds, &c., were furnished to all the brokers in the City, and the request was made that any person offering to negotiate any of the scrip might be detained. On Wednesday last Mr. SMITH TUTTLE, a lawyer, doing business at No. 5 Beekman-street, offered to dispose of three of the stolen bonds at the office of a Wall-street broker, but they were at once recognized as corresponding in description to a portion of those which belonged to Mr. PEARSON. Accordingly the brokers requested that the scrip might be left with them until the following day, when, should they decide to purchase it in the interval, the money would be handed him when he called. Information of this attempt to sell these bonds was at once given by the brokers to Bank-Detective HAYS and Special Officer FLAVIN, of the First Precinct, who duly awaited next day the appearance of Mr. TUTTLE at the broker's office. As soon as he presented himself he was taken into custody, and upon being interrogated as to the manner in which the bonds came into his possession, he replied that he had received them from JULIUS M. STICH, a client of his, who then could be found at his (TUTTLE's) office, in Beekman-street. The officers went there, accompanied by Mr. TUTTLE, and found STICH, who was at once arrested. Both prisoners were taken before Justice WELSH at the Tombs, where a partial examination of the matter resulted in the discharge of Mr. TUTTLE, who was shown merely to have acted as the agent of STICH, without having any criminal knowledge as to the character of the bonds he had endeavored to sell. Yesterday afternoon, STICH, who had been temporarily committed to prison, was arraigned before Justice WELSH on a charge of having committed the burglary at Mr. BUCHAN's residence, and stolen the bonds, and other property. He stated in his examination that he was a broker by occupation, and that he had obtained the three bonds, which he had commissioned TUTTLE, from an old gentleman named ISAACS, a perfect stranger to himself, whom he casually met on Wednesday morning at French's Hotel, and who represented that he was from Cincinnati, Ohio. Believing the representations of the old gentleman to be true, he had purchased the bonds, and found himself in difficulty as the consequence. To procure the attendance of other witnesses, the investigation was adjourned to this morning. Meantime STICH is a prisoner in the Tombs, the magistrate having decided not to admit him to ball until the grade of the crime of which he is alleged to be guilty can be determined on. The value of the bonds recovered is $1,500, but no trace of the remaining bonds, certificates of stock, or other proceeds of the burglary, has so far been obtained.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/22/archives/burglary-in-fourthstreet-44000-in-railroad-bonds-and-certificates.html,,"The dwelling-house of Mr. JAMES BUCHAN, No. 376 Fourth-street, was visited by burglars on the night of the 11th inst., at which time the occupants were absent in the country, and robbed of a very considerable amount of property.

"The Prince of Wales on Thursday evening, at Detroit, experienced a very decided foretaste of the receptions which await him in his brief tour through the United States. He reached Windsor at 8 o'clock, and went on board the Detroit and and Windsor ferry-steamer Windsor, where he was received by the Governor of Michigan, the Mayor and Councilmen of Detroit, and a number of prominent citizens. When the steamer reached American waters, the Mayor welcomed the Prince, as Baron RENFREW, to the United States. The river and the city presented a magnificent spectacle, the steamers and other vessels in the former being hung with variegated lamps, and decorated with banners and emblems, and the latter being splendidly illuminated. Rockets and other fireworks were let off continually, and the river was a blaze of light, the whole forming the grandest display witnessed by his Highness during his sojourn in America. The crowd was so dense at the landing-place that it was found impossible to form the procession which had been arranged to escort him to his hotel, and after several ineffectual attempts it was found necessary for him to enter a private carriage and proceed through by-streets. His suite followed him shortly afterwards, escorted by the firemen of Detroit. The enthusiasm of the crowd was something tremendous, and found vent in cheer upon cheer. Yesterday, after a drive through the city with the Mayor, his progress being impeded at every step by enthusiastic crowds, the Prince with his suite proceeded to the Railroad depot and took his departure for Chicago, where, after a somewhat tedious journey, he arrived at 7 1/2 o'clock last evening: Here, as at Detroit, an immense concourse awaited his arrival, though, through the admirable regulations of the Police, everything was done ""decently and in order.""

The owner very kindly tendered the use of hip place to the Garibaldi Aid Committee, to give a festival for the benefit of the Garibaldi Fund. The room was elegantly and tastefully ornamented by means of garlands of green leaves and fresh flowers, and numerous banners, bearing the colors of different nationalities. One of the most prominent was the banner of the Polish emigrants residing here, being of red silk, bearing the white eagle and the motto in their own language, ""God and the People."" The two ribbons pending from the staff, bore the inscriptions, ""Death to all Tyrants,"" and ""Poland is not Lost yet."" The festival consisted of a concert, both vocal and instrumental, by Frischman's band and the German Glee Clubs, Social Reform Gesangverein, Loreley Maennerchor and Bloomingdale Frohsimr, and a ball. Speeches by Mr. GUSTAPHUS STENVE, the President of the Committee, in German, and Mr. ISAAC DAYTON, in English, were delivered and well received by the numerous audience. Over the orchestra were several wreaths of oak leaves inclosing the letters G. and M., (GARIBALDI and MAZZINI,) and ""Welcome to the Friends of Liberty.""

"THE COOLIE TRADE. -- Statistics of the coolie trade with Cuba show that up to the 18th of December, 1859, there had been 42,501 Chinese coolies landed at the different island ports.

Mr. BUCHANAN'S efforts to settle the American claims against Peru are not likely to be crowned with more success than his efforts in the same direction in other quarters have been.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/24/archives/peru.html,,"Mr. BUCHANAN'S efforts to settle the American claims against Peru are not likely to be crowned with more success than his efforts in the same direction in other quarters have been. It is generally understood that our Minister, in July last, was instructed to demand a settlement of the damages for the seizure of the Georgiana and Lizzie Thompson within four days, in default of which he was to suspend diplomatic relations, and to agree to an arbitration in the case of the whaleship William Lee, and in the, matter of the other two claims for the imprisonment and cruelties inflicted upon Mr. SARTORI, and the destruction of the property of Dr. CHARLES ESTON by Government troops. When these instructions reached Mr. CLAY, (his ""peremptory demand"" for a settlement three months previously having failed,) the Peruvian Secretary of Relations had just resigned; so Mr. C. had to wait some time for the appointment of a new one on whom to make the demand. Then, before the new Secretary was fairly installed, somebody shot at and severely wounded President CASTILLA, and Mr. CLAY has to wait till he recovers, as the Secretary dare not move without his master's consent. But as the President is said to have so far regained his strength as to ""ride out in his carriage on the Alameda, guarded by fifty horsemen,"" it is fair to presume our Minister will not much longer postpone his demand. The result, however, cannot be doubtful. CASTILLA will never pay a dollar for the Georgiana and Lizzie Thompson until compelled by force to do so. He is willing to refer the matter to the arbitrament of a foreign Power -- but as no foreign Power would be likely to admit the doctrine that a small revolutionary party occupying but one or two ports of a country has a right to bind the Government to its contracts, the United States Government will not accede to that proposition. In the meantime an American agent passed through Panama the other day for Peru, and it is rumored he took out instructions to Mr. CLAY modifying his previous ones -- which would not be surprising, considering the vacillating temper of Mr. BUCHANAN, and especially in view of the wet blanket application of Mr. CAVE JOHNSON in the matter of the Paraguan claims of Mr. HOPKINS. Had Mr. CLAY been properly supported by the United States Executive at the outset, in these claims, they would have been paid long ago -- but now they must wait the more energetic action of a new Administration.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERU.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERU.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Peru', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/775c0baf-0255-5f7a-89da-e9075ba8702a,806,nyt://article/775c0baf-0255-5f7a-89da-e9075ba8702a,

"""His Honor"" the Mayor continues to give periodical proofs that he retains a very fair share of that useful quality which, in newsboys or hackmen, would be termed impudence, but which, when displayed by great public functionaries, is usually termed audacity.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/24/archives/fernando-the-facetious.html,,"""His Honor"" the Mayor continues to give periodical proofs that he retains a very fair share of that useful quality which, in newsboys or hackmen, would be termed impudence, but which, when displayed by great public functionaries, is usually termed audacity. His last display of it fortifies the claim he has already so often put forward to the character of wag, as it bears the strongest resemblance to a bad joke. Our readers may remember that the work of laying the new pipe in the Aqueduct at High Bridge was interrupted, owing to ""His Honor's"" refusal to countersign the warrant for the payment of the expenses of the work. This bit of interference was simply a preliminary to the execution of a scheme for the removal of Messrs. CRAVEN and TAPPAN, the engineers, because they had not shown themselves sufficiently pliant in the matter of allowing the conversion of the employes of the Croton Board into His Honor's political tools. The scheme has failed, as our readers know, owing to His Honor's total inability to prove a single charge of the many which he made against these gentlemen; but during the four months occupied by the quarrel and investigation, the water-pipes now in use on the aqueduct, which had to be stopped preparatory to putting down the new one, have lain exposed to the weather, all owing to the Mayor's obstinate refusal to let the work proceed, until he had got rid of Messrs. CRAVEN and TAPPAN. In the interval the Board have frequently drawn attention to the danger of allowing these pipes to be exposed to the frost, and have three times urged it on that of the Mayor, and have announced their intention, in case ""His Honor"" carried on his opposition till the Winter set in, to place a temporary wooden roof over them as a measure of precaution.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/24/archives/our-foreign-impolicy.html,,"From the South American intelligence, to be found in another column, we ascertain the claims of the United States upon Peru to be as far as ever from settlement. The story of wrong upon which the claims rest is an old one, so old as to require perhaps a brief restatement. At the close of 1857, Gen.

By way of a joke, while he was taking his nap, his face was smeared with soot, or some other black substance, and when he awoke and discovered the trick that had been played he was much enraged. Falling to learn the name of the person who had offended him, he determined to have satisfaction of Hayes, who was laughing, with the other occupants of the place, at what they considered a good joke. Accordingly, Hoy seized a knife and rushed upon Hayes, whom he stabbed in the neck, breast and abdomen. Great excitement followed, in the midst of which Hoy endeavored to run away, but he was pursued and taken into custody.

A larger mass-meeting of music's votaries has not been held on the Mail this season. There were fewer strangers, perhaps, and more townspeople there than on any previous day of those consecrated to the concert-loving; for, at this season more than at any other, the travelers and the swallows fly homeward. Gotham is again Gothamite; and Southern, Eastern and Western visitors -- the pleasure-seekers that is, not the business-bound -- are turning their faces toward the light of their own firesides. There were more elegant equipages, more daintily attired damsels, more young gentlemen, caparisoned entirely regardless of expense, on foot and on horseback, at the Park day before yesterday, than were wont to be there a month ago when it was vulgar to be in town. The horsemen were especially numerous. From a single Riding School on Fifth-avenue, thirty steeds saddled and bridled, went forth. The proprietor endeavored to deter the applicant for the thirty-first from his persistent design of riding horseback on the worst animal in the stable. In vain he showed him his list of prices, assured him that he himself was a charger, -- in vain said ""nay"" full twenty times. The horse was brought, mounted, and led forth into the open street. He plunged, he reared, he pawed the air, and endeavored to jump fences. He was constantly in motion, yet did not progress an inch. He was taken back into the school, and the master promised that he should have a good training. Apparently every equine quadruped in City livery stables that would carry a saddle and a man on his back was pressed into the service for an excursion to the Park. Then; the cars were crowded, and hundreds of pedestrians wended their way thither. The highly-respectable performances of the band, the inhalation of fresh air, and a view of the prettiest park scenery in this counter, even at this day, amply repaid all who took the jaunt, whatever their means of conveyance.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f61ae997-4db3-58f6-8605-119912459f8e,1587,nyt://article/f61ae997-4db3-58f6-8605-119912459f8e,

SCHWARZWAELDER, Brigade Major Alford, Major Burger, Paymaster Fearing, Quartermaster Dalton, Chaplain Eddy, Capts. Hertman, Gerdes, Mander, and Hinslage; Lieuts. Schaefer, Bretman, Meyer and Luke; Orderly Sergeant Leitz, and Lieut. Wm. Sinclair, of the Third Artillery, U.S.A. The object of the visit was to inspect the barracks of the fort, where the Fifth, as it has already been fully announced, is ""to encamp,"" (that is according to the order,) but in reality is to perform thorough garrison duty, and practice gunnery) for a week, commencing to-morrow morning. Four barbette guns were found mounted on the south ""terre plain."" These were mounted last Monday by 20 men from Fort Hamilton, under the command of Lieut. SINCLAIR, and are to be used daily by detachments of the Fifth, until every man of the 500 is initiated into the artillery drill. The East and West Barracks, consisting of four large rooms, are to be used by the privates; the North Barrack is to be used by the line officers, and the Hospital by the Field and Staff; all are in excellent condition. There are two large kitchens and plenty of bath-rooms. The men will sleep in the old-fashioned double wooden bunks formerly used in the army. Gen. SANFORD will be invited to inspect the garrison next Tuesday or Wednesday. The expense of the week's duty will be for rations alone 70 cents per day to each man, and then the ammunition, locks and friction tubes, both of which are to be used, are also to be paid for by the Regiment. Maj. ROBERT ANDERSON, of the First Artillery, U.S.A., who is to instruct the Regiment, was not present yesterday. At about 4 o'clock the party returned highly pleased with the quarters. After the Regiment is garrisoned tickets will be issued to spectators, but none will be allowed in the garrison until the latter part of the week.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0044647b-60be-5ba5-b37d-c2c2de8788ec,1109,nyt://article/0044647b-60be-5ba5-b37d-c2c2de8788ec,

Mr. ARCHIBALD, the British Consul, briefly stated that the original Committee was increased to forty, and that, with the approval of the Mayor and the leading members of the City (Banquet) Committee, they decided to get up a ball. A liberal beginning had been made with the subscriptions to defray the expenses, when, it being ascertained that a ball would be more agreeable to the Prince than a banquet, the citizens changed their original plan, and decided upon a ball at the Academy. Being well represented in these latter arrangements, the British residents decided not to make any distinctive demonstration, except to tender the Prince an address, if that should be found agreeable. This proposal was conveyed to the Duke of NEWCASTLE, through Lord LYONS. In response, the Duke, with the approval of Lord RENFREW, referred to the invitation already received through the Committee of Citizens, and respectfully declining the proposed demonstration, for the offer of which, however, he was very grateful and obliged. Similar demonstrations, had been offered in other places in the United States, and declined.

"The news of the departure of the King of Naples for Capua and Gaeta is now certain. This news has been expected for some days. It still produces,never-...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/25/archives/the-exking-of-naples-at-gaeta.html,,"The news of the departure of the King of Naples for Capua and Gaeta is now certain. This news has been expected for some days. It still produces,nevertheless, a considerable effect, for it had been imagined that the King would make, under the walls of his capital, with the troops that have remained faithful to him, a last attempt at resistance. It is at Gaeta -- that is, in the strongest position there is in the Kingdom, regarded in a military point of view -- that he will await a return of good fortune, or endeavor to provoke it. He withdraws with a contingent of troops still respectable enough -- being 30,000 strong, it is said -- and which, considering the excellence of the position, must be taken into account. In fact, if in a political point of view the abandonment of Naples is quite a revolution of itself, in a military point of view it is an act of dexterity, or at least of prudence. Naples is open, or rather it opens itself spontaneously. Before even the King left it, FRANCIS had, we may say, ceased to reign there. The movement of men's minds there, the impulse that carries away the population and drives it to throw itself into the arms of GARIBALDI, might cause a complete dissolution of the last nucleus of strength at the young King's disposal. The city, it is true, is entirely commanded by Fort St. Elmo, a stronghold not easily to be taken, cut out of the rock, and at some places standing on an elevation of eighty feet. But to remain master of that point would be to put himself under the necessity of a painful, and probably a fruitless operation -- that of bombarding the Capital of the Continental Kingdom, as he had the Sicilian Capital -- an inhuman proceeding, and, therefore, most impolitic. The young King, yielding to the advice of his most prudent friends, has preferred retiring to Gaeta, where he will add to the advantage of a royal residence, and of a still stronger military position, that of remaining master of a part of his States, and approaching nearer to the only ally he has preserved -- the Pope -- whose Government has at its disposal 25,000 men, pretty well organized, it is said, by Gen. LAMORICIERE. Gaeta, a fortified town of 14,000 inhabitants, including its three suburbs, is situate in the Terra di Lavoro, of which the administrative capital is Caserta, between Capua and Naples. It consists of Irregular works, rising in terraces one above the other, on a rocky headland of the Mediterranean Coast. On the land side the narrow approach is closed by strong batteries; a fort commands the harbor, and at the extremity of this point there is the old tower called Rolando's. Gaeta was besieged in 1800 by the French, and in 1815 by the Austrians. Very strong by nature, this position is rendered yet stronger by the configuration of the surrounding locality. For any one master of Gaeta, and having a sufficient number of troops at his disposal, it is easy to defend San Germano on the northeast, and Capua on the southeast; and these three points form a triangular district, in which the last efforts of the Bourbon monarchy will probably be concentrated. San Germano and Capua are both situate about ten leagues from Gaeta; San Germano, on the Fiume-Rapido, is at the foot of Mount Cassino, the summit of which is crowned by the ancient and vast abbey of the same name. This position may be used as a military retreat, and can easily be defended. Capua, on the Volturno, possesses an arsenal, a military hospital, and 8,000 inhabitants. The Volturno is crossed there by means of a stone bridge, and on the right bank of the river there is a strong tete-de-pont. A strong casemate has been constructed to the east of the town. Capua lies, as is well known, half-way between Naples and Gaeta. It is from that point that the King will reach his last asylum. Doubtless he would leave behind him at this intermediate station a sufficient number of troops to defend it, if the war now being waged by him were a regular war, but he is rather a spectator than an actor in the scene. The situation is controlled by unexpected events; and, if he merely intends waiting for events, he will perhaps do nothing more than concentrate his forces in Gaeta. This we shall soon learn by news from the Two Sicilies.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EX-KING OF NAPLES AT GAETA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EX-KING OF NAPLES AT GAETA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From Le Nord', 'person': [{'firstname': 'From', 'middlename': 'Le', 'lastname': 'Nord', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/704a84a9-8978-56a5-ba66-2313e1bffc97,758,nyt://article/704a84a9-8978-56a5-ba66-2313e1bffc97,

"A very great excitement was occasioned on the west side of the First Ward yesterday forenoon, by the attempt on the part of HENRY N. PIERREPONT, a shoemaker, living at No. 46 Greenwich-street, to murder a woman named HANNAH JONES, to whom for a few weeks past fee has been under an engagement of marriage. In July last Mrs. JONES, who keeps a boarding-house and drinking-place at No. 22 1/2 Morris-street, became a widow, PIERREPONT had been an intimate friend of her husband's, and after the decease of the latter he had endeavored to do all in his power for the bereaved wife. He assisted in settling up the affairs of deceased and by his management Mrs. JONES was enabled to retain possession of the business. In all her troubles the widow found in PIERREPONT a counselor in whom she could rely, and finally he seemed so indispensable to her that when he made an offer to marry her, it found on her part a ready acceptance. Such has been the condition of affairs for some weeks, during which time the ardent shoemaker has invested all his spare cash in presents for his affianced, and the course of their true love seemed to show an exception to the old adage. Late on Sunday night, however, PIERREPONT's short dream of happiness was disturbed. An acquaintance called upon him, and inquired if he would go and witness for himself the infidelity of this betrothed. He doubted the truth of his friend's words, but consented to go with him. Accordingly, they obtained admission by stealth to the rear yard of the premises occupied by Mrs. JONES, and raising the window-curtain, PIERREPONT saw the widow under circumstances which excited his jealousy and indignation. His first impulse was to avenge himself upon his rival, but his friend restrained him, and he returned home without having discovered himself to his deceiver. After nursing his jealous feelings all night, in a state bordering upon frenzy, he went to Mrs. JONES' house, and demanded an explanation of the conduct he had witnessed the previous evening. She replied that the person he had seen in her company was an employe of one of the Express Companies in Broadway, and being desirous that he should board with her, she had endeavored to secure his favor. The explanation did not satisfy PIERREPONT, who upbraided the woman, until finally she said that the engagement between them would be broken. She also offered to restore what presents he had given her, and to reimburse him for whatever else she had received from him. As she was in the act of leaving the room PIERREPONT caught her by the hand, and drawing a shoemaker's knife from his breast pocket, he thrust it into her right arm. The blow severed the large artery lengthwise, and caused a dangerous wound, from which the blood poured copiously. The injured woman escaped from the grasp of the desperate man, and ran screaming across the street into the liquor-store of JAMES FITZGERALD, No. 21 Morris-street, where she ran into a bed-room on the second floor, and attempted to close the door. FITZGERALD and the family were at dinner at the time, and Mrs. JONES, to reach the apartment where she had taken refuge, had to pass through the room in which they were eating. Mrs. FITZGERALD and another woman followed her up stairs but almost at the same moment PIERREPONT ran up also, and discharged one barrel of a horse-pistol in the direction of the closed door. The ball nearly grazed Mrs. FITZGERALD's face and entered the head of Mrs. JONES, a short distance in front and directly above the left ear. PIERREPONT immediately placed the pistol to his own head, and doubtless would have killed himself had not Mr. FITZGERALD seized the weapon and struggled to obtain possession of it. Meantime a crowd had been drawn together and some of the men made an attack upon PIERREPONT, who was knocked down and beaten in a shameful manner. In fact, he would probably have been lynched, in accordance with a cry to that effect, but for the timely arrival of Officer GEO. ROWLAND, of the First Ward, who rescued him from his assailants, and took him to the Police Sub-Station, which is near by, in Trinity-place. Sergt. WEMYSS having been informed of what had transpired, promptly repaired to the scene of the occurrence, and caused the wounded woman to be removed to the New-York Hospital. She was placed in the hands of Dr. WEIR, the House Surgeon, who, after probing her wound for several inches, was unable to find the ball, which has lodged in the brain. Her condition is pronounced to be beyond all hope. PIERREPONT at a late hour in the afternoon was taken before Justice KELLY at the Tombs, who committed him to await the result of the injuries he had caused. The prisoner is a native of Liverpool, England, aged 40, and he has lived in the First Ward about twelve years. He has always borne a good reputation, and his appearance would not warrant a belief that he could have perpetrated so terrible a crime. He expressed himself sorry that the attempt that he made on his life was a failure, but said he felt no remorse for what he had done to the woman, whose conduct, he thought, sufficiently justified him. Mrs. JONES, his victim, is an Irishwoman, about 25 years of age. At a late hour last evening she remained at the Hospital in the semi-conscious condition in which she was when admitted.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/09/25/archives/shocking-occurence-in-the-first-ward-a-woman-fatally-wounded-by-her.html,,"A very great excitement was occasioned on the west side of the First Ward yesterday forenoon, by the attempt on the part of HENRY N.

The details that we are enabled to give a to-day are important and extremely interesting. Though we have not yet received particulars of GARIBALDI's triumphal entry into Naples, we now know most of the events which preceded that culmination of the Neapolitan war. The situation of the Ex-King is said to have been so deplorable as to have excited the compassion of his enemies. He has taken refuge in his own fortified town of Gaeta, whence, as soon as the time comes, he will pass to Capua and to Austrian territory, for he has been advised by the Emperor FRANCIS JOSEPH not to go to Madrid. The most important news brought by the Adriatic is the announcement of a rupture between Piedmont and Rome. The latter is said to have demanded peremptorily the dissolution of the free corps, enlisted under the orders of Gen. LAMORICIERE, as being a body hostile to the peace of Italy. According to latest advices, no Sardinian troops had, as yet, crossed the frontiers, but they were being collected in large numbers in the Cattolica, at Piazenza, and at Arezzo, in Tuscany. France, in the semi-official columns of the Constitutionnel, protests against this aggression of Piedmont, and asserts that it ""will separate it from the Emperor's policy."" Austria, too, is again making extensive warlike preparations, having concentrated a corps d'armee of 50,000 troops in the Mantuan territory. It is officially announced from St. Petersburgs that the Emperors of Austria and Russia are once more friends, and that the meeting of reconciliation between the two Sovereigns will take place at Warsaw. The miscellaneous intelligence received by the Adriaiic is also of an interesting character.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6d59d87-80a4-5a65-808b-7dc520fa14f8,1831,nyt://article/a6d59d87-80a4-5a65-808b-7dc520fa14f8,

BANKS and his resignation supply the text, upon the diversion in the United States of the highest ability from the service of the State into the paths of private enterprise. The inadequacy of American salaries in the leading positions of public life is assumed by the Times to account in a very considerable degree for the unhappy results which it deplores, and the inference is left to be drawn that in America we systematically starve talent and character out of national fame into the obscurity of fortune, and fairly force genius into abdicating the laurel wreaths of history and accepting the loaves and fishes of the hour. There can be little doubt that men of the first force do not seek public posts so generally and so naturally as they once did, either in the United States or in Europe. The case of Gov. BANKS, however, can scarcely be quoted in illustration of this truth without implying a rather scurvy compliment to that gentleman, who has done nothing to escape and much to deserve the honors of political life, and whose present action in leaving the Executive chair of Massachusetts for a comfortable commercial post in Illinois is not necessarily to be interpreted as a definite abandonment of a career which had reached its term in the East, and could only be prolonged by opening new channels for itself in the West.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Political Life and its Prizes England and America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Political Life and its Prizes England and America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4c2b199-7105-558e-a1e1-c464b35a4bd9,1062,nyt://article/f4c2b199-7105-558e-a1e1-c464b35a4bd9,

"A man over sixty years of age, giving the name of Edward Carter was yesterday brought before Justice KELLY at the Tombs, on a charge of having defrauded Mr. Lewis L. Whitehead, a merchant of No. 33 Cortlandt-street, to the extent of $30, by means of false representations. The prisoner, a few weeks since, called upon the complainant and exhibited bills of lading for 56 cases of boots and shoes, which he represented had been consigned to him by Wm. Totten & Son, of Portland, Me., and desired to transfer the goods to Mr. Whitehead to sell. The old man, in course of conversation, remarked that he had until a short time previous been a merchant in Massachusetts, where he was still possessed of considerable property. He also stated that he was going to Baltimore, and asked Mr. Whitehead to advance him $30 upon a check on the Massachusetts Bank for $100, representing that he kept an account in that institution. This check, signed James Adams, which the prisoner stated was his name, was left with Mr. Whitehead as collateral security, and the money having been advanced the old gentleman promised to call on his return from the South and receive the balance of $75 Mr. White-house subsequently forwarded the check to the Boston Bank, and in due time received an answer that Adams had no deposit in the institution. The consignment of boots and shoes having failed to arrive, Mr. Whitehead was forced to the conclusion that he had been swindled, and, consequently, has since sought to find the prisoner, not meeting with success, however, until yesterday. When his examination before the magistrate was in progress, Carter stated that he was guilty of the crime charged, and had been forced to commit it to save himself from starvation. The prospect of a shelter, even though it was no better nor respectable than a cell in the prison, he considered preferable to wandering homeless and destitute about the streets. He also said that he had formerly been engaged extensively in a mercantile business in this City, but that a series of reverses had reduced him to penury. Among his acquaintances in his prosperous days were Simeon Draper and other well-known merchants, and he still had wealthy sisters in Cambridge, Mass., of whom, however, he could not bring himself to ask relict. He added that on several occasions he had applied to the Commissioners of Public Charities and Corrections for relief, but no notice had been taken of his petition. It is difficult to say whether the old man's statement is reliable or the reverse, but, at any rate, it needs confirmation, particularly as two worthless checks, amounting to over $300, were found in his possession.

Between the obtrusive civilities of fawning sycophants, and the brutal feuds of rival religious factions, the Prince seemed destined to wear a martyr's crown instead of the Crown of England; but he was threatened with martyrdom, simply for being a Prince, and not because he advocated a principle. However glorious it may be to die for opinion's sake, there is nothing very pleasant in the idea of being sacrificed for refusing to embrace and advocate the extreme religious opinions of others. It must also have occurred to the Prince, that if thus treated during a tour through his own Provinces, he must expect to encounter unmitigated tribulations while sojourning among a people bound to him by no hereditary ties, and accustomed to view Royalty in the abstract with little respect.

The former arrived yesterday morning, and the latter at 1 o'clock this morning. The news, which is to the 16th inst., is of a very important character. Sardinia, it appears, has not waited from Rome a reply to her ultimatum demanding that Gen. LAMORICIERE's troops be disbanded as hostile to the peace of Italy, but has invaded Roman territory with 50,000 men. The town of Pesaro had already been attacked and captured. According to the latest advices, a battle might take place at any moment, between the Sardinians and Gen. LAMORICIERE. Several Powers had protested against the action of Piedmont as an attack upon international rights, and France, in accordance with the policy foreshadowed in the Constitutionnel, is so much opposed to the aggression, that a rupture between the two Governments is not deemed an impossible event. Indeed, it is reported that the French Minister had already left Turin. The French army at Rome is to be increased, and has been placed under the command of Gen. GUYON. The Ex-King of Naples, it appears, has decided to make Spain his place of refuge, as his departure for that country is announced. The miscellaneous European news by this arrival is not important.

It appears from the testimony of CORNELIUS DOCHERTY, a hand on board the lighter, that on the day the occurrence transpired, deceased and himself were on board their vessel at the foot of Jay-street, N.R. They desired to haul the lighter to the next pier, and got out a line for that purpose. They had partially accomplished their design when the steamboat Aurora came out of the dock and hailed them to get out of the way. The Captain of the steamer was requested to wait a few moments, but he did not comply, and his vessel came in contact with the lighter's hawser which was fastened to the capstan, and the effect was to capsize her. Witness extricated himself from the lighter, but QUIGLEY was caught in the rigging and drowned.

In the absence of the President, WM.W. BADGER called the meeting to order, and briefly explained its origin and objects. He said that several Irish gentlemen, whose sympathies had heretofore been with the Democratic Party, but who had become disgusted with the recent attempts at fusion, and to allure Irishmen into voting for S.A. DOUGALS, in conjunction with the Know-Nothings, had suggested the calling of a meeting of Irishmen, to protest against being thus sold and delivered over to the service of their ancient enemies. With proper effort, he believed that ten thousand Irishmen in this City would cast their votes for the Republican candidates. In the First Ward, where there were not one hundred and fifty Republican votes for FREMOST, in 1856, there were now over four hundred pledged to go for LINCOLN and HAMLIN. Irishmen were informing themselves everywhere as to Republican principles, and when they found that this party was the same as the Democratic Party at home, which went for the rights of the working man, they would gladly join their ranks, and labor with the party of freedom.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY POLITICS.; Republicanisan among Irish-Americans.

Mr. A.H. CULVER, a passenger on the 5 o'clock P.M., train, deposed that he left the cars at Fordham Station, and as he walked up the road he observed deceased driving down in a buggy. He called to him to stop, as a train was just coming down. Deceased stopped for a moment, and then attempted to cross in front of a train, but the locomotive struck the wagon, and he fell upon the cow-catcher, which bore him along for some distance. The brother of deceased testified that he witnessed the occurrence. He believed that the train was going at the time at a speed of 20 or 25 miles an hour. A flagman was usually stationed at the crossing, but he was not there on this occasion. This flagman, in addition to the duties of that position, also divided his time by filling the offices of postmaster, ticket agent, freight agent, express agent and switchman. He was also required to attend to both depots -- upper and lower -- and to superintend the furnishing of water to the engine. As soon as deceased was picked up he was taken to his residence in Eighty-fifth-street, where he died in a few minutes after his arrival. Upon this testimony a verdict was rendered as follows: ""That THOMAS MCKEON came to his death by fracture of the skull, the result of being struck by a locomotive of the Harlem Railroad Company, at Fordham Station, on the 22d of September.

A. WRIGHT, the United States Envoy to the Court of Prussia, Mr. BUCHANAN, from Copenhagen, and Mr. JOHN APPLETON, the newly-appointed American Ambassador to St. Petersburg. The immediate object of their conferences, which lasted several days, was to take into consideration the present unsettled state of Europe and enter into mutual arrangements for joint action on several points, one of the most important of which is the protection to be effectively afforded by the United States flag to the numerous naturalized Germans who have become citizens of the United States. Mr. APPLETON has already left this city for Lubeck, en route for St. Petersburg, where he will relieve Mr. PICKENS, hitherto the representative of the United States in Russia, who has tendered his resignation and only remains at St. Petersburg till the arrival of his successor.""",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-09-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e97ddc33-a6dc-5f85-974d-7e7dd7ad32b9,663,nyt://article/e97ddc33-a6dc-5f85-974d-7e7dd7ad32b9,
