As soon as the ship was fairly secured to her dock, and the passengers were out of the way, gangs or workmen were organized to clean, paint, varnish, and otherwise put the ship in order. The five smoke-pipes, which were so unsightly upon her arrival, have been painted with a coat of cream color, and the topmasts are undergoing the scraping process, which greatly improves the appearance of the spars and top-hamper; the houses on deck are to be smoothed by sandpaper and varnished, which will give freshness to the mahogany in striking contrast with their blistered and sun-dried appearance when she arrived. The outside of the ship will be painted, the brass work scouted up, the engines polished off, the saloons swept and garnished, and everything put in the most inviting condition. The great extant of surface to be gone over, makes this renovating process necessarily a laborious one, one, it is feared, will not be finished at so early a day as has been announced -- Tuesday, the 3d of July. At a meeting of the directors, which took place on Saturday at the counting-room of Messrs. GRINNEIL, MINTURN & Co., that day was fixed upon for admission of visitors, and the price for tickets established at one dollar for adults, and ""children under twelve years half price."" An impression having gained ground that fifty cents would be the maximum charge, very general disappointment was expressed. The plan adopted in England, of setting apart particular days of the week for the sale of tickets at reduced rates, it is hoped may be adopted, and particularly that the Fourth of July may be thus set apart, when so many from the country will make the journey to New-York for the sole purpose of viewing the steamer. The announcement that a dollar will be charged, will deter thousands from coming, to whom fifty cents would be no objection. All these matters, however, were thoroughly discussed at the meeting. All persons are rigidly excluded, and necessarily so, until the paint is dry. It is stated that the approaches to the ship will be covered with coarse gravel, to prevent the dust from flying, clouds of which obscure the sight and damage the dilicate wardrobes of ladies who go upon the ground in a windy day.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE GREAT EASTERN.; Arrangements for Visiting the Ship The Day and Price of Admission Fixed The Rush of Sunday Spectators Accidents to the Ship and the Crew.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE GREAT EASTERN.; Arrangements for Visiting the Ship The Day and Price of Admission Fixed The Rush of Sunday Spectators Accidents to the Ship and the Crew.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/098636dc-2a5a-5b08-8d74-f990548d4e07,1013,nyt://article/098636dc-2a5a-5b08-8d74-f990548d4e07,

The victims are Mr. JOHN WALTON, a well-known distiller, doing business in this City, and Mr. JOHN WARTS MATHEWS, a railroad contractor, who resided with his brother at No. 31 Union-place. Both of these gentlemen were strangers to each other, and Mr. MATHEWS was shot dead while attempting to secure the man who, a few moments before, had given the death-wound to Mr.WALTON. The following narrative of the affair, and the cir[???]stances which probably [???]ed to the double crime, was obtained from authentic sources. Mr, WALTON was a member of the firm of LONG & WALTON, distillers, having a store at Nos. 93 and 05 West Twenty-fifth-street, and a distillery in Eighteen-street, a short distance east of First-avenue. On account of unhappiness in his relations with his wife for some months past Mr. WILTON had lived in an upper apartment of the premises in which his store was located, and usually visited the distillery on Thursday and Saturday Rights. On the evening of his death, in company with his cousin, RICHARD H. PASCALL, who acted as his clerk, he-had been in the distillery and collected the day's receipts, and was returning up Eighteenth street on his way home. Near the corner of Third avenue, the attention of Mr. PASCALL and himself was attracted fey a man, dressed in light clothes and wearing a straw-hat,who leaned against a tree, but as no attack was anticipated, they passed close to him. Scarcely however, had they gone three steps beyond when the stranger stepped quickly up to Mr. WALTON and discharged a pistol at his head. The ball entered behind his left ear, and he sank to the pavement without uttering a word. PASCALL, whom the report of the pistol had somewhat stunned, upon recovering from his fright, called ""Murder,"" and started in pursuit of the assassin, who had crossed the street, and was running in the direction of Irving place. A number of persons, among whom were two policemen, responded to the call for assistance, and joined in the chase of the murderer. Among them was Mr. MATTHEWS , who, with another man, had so far gained upon the fugitive as to have almost overtaken him by the time he had reached the corner of Sixteenth-street and Irving-place. At that point the man turned upon his pursuers and fired. Mr. MATTHEWS immediately fell, excialming, ""I'm a dead man"" having received the bail in his chest. The confusion occasioned by the occurrence diverted the attention of the crowd from the murderer for an instant, and afterwards do trace of his course was obtained. Mr. MATTHEWS was immediately removed to a drag-store at the corner of Sixteenth-street and Third avenue, but died in the arms of the men who were carrying him thither. Meantime Mr. WALTON had been taken to the druggist's at the corner of Eighteenth-street, where measures were adopted to restore him to consciousness. He never revived sufficiently to speak, however, and was taken thence to Be[???]rve Hospital. There lie lingered for several hours, perfectly insensible, and died early morning.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""A MIDNIGHT TRAGEDY.; Two Men Assassinated--Escape of the Murderer.

Not being able to secure a trip to Europe in the beginning of the season in company with ""a savant,"" he has contented himself with a less exciting visit to Boston; but what he has lost in the length of the tour, he has gained in the number of the tourists. The original Commission of Inquiry into the sanitary condition of all the most agreeable and interesting cities of the Old World was to consist of only one member from each Board of the Common Council -- the ""savant"" making the third. This arrangement was, however, not carried out, partly, we believe, because everybody else was just as anxious to investigate sanitary matters in Europe as were BOOLE and VAN TINE; partly because some difficulty was anticipated in finding a savant impecunous enough to consent to traveling in such company; partly because Mayor WOOD showed his teeth in advance; but mainly because the Japanese and the $30,000 just then began to loom up on the horizon. The idea was, however, not wholly abandoned. The health of the City could not be entirely neglected, and failing an inspection of European sinks, sewers and slums, it was determined that a monster deputation of more than twenty philosophers, seven from each branch of the Common Council, and seven from the Board of Health, should proceed to Boston to attend the meetings of the Sanitary Convention recently sitting in that city.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/02/archives/the-defence-of-london.html,,"An aritcle from Sir JOHN BURGOYNE, who commanded the English engineers at Sebastopol, until he was snubbed and sent home for maintaining that the Malakoff was the key of the position, published in the Cornhill Magazine, upon the defence of London, has thrown the British public into a state of great excitement. He proposes to surround the city with a chain of earthworks of great strength, arm them heavily with rifled guns, and rely on the volunteers to man them. He asserts, and with truth, that this is the only way in which -- in the present state of military science -- a small and imperfectly disciplined force can reasonably expect to be able to stand their ground against a large and efficient one; that recent experience has proved that all that is needed to make well-constructed earthworks tenable for any reasonable length of time, is plenty of ammunition and plenty of pluck, requisites which the rifle volunteers can readily supply. The Arab Tabia, the redoubt at Salistria, which a small garrison held for two months in the last war against a Russian force of sixty thousand men, proves, even more conclusive than Sebastopol itself, that if the rear of such a work can be kept open, so that supplies and reinforcements can be regularly forwarded to the garrison, it is all but impregnable, as long as the defenders are determined to fight. The old rules, by which an engineer could deduce from the number of the garrison and extent of the works almost the exact number of days, of ""open trenches,"" that would insure the fate of the place, entirely fail when applied to earthworks, for the simple reason that the opening of a breach is all but an impossibility, and without this an assault can be made with just as much chance of success, barring the demoralization of the garrison, on the first day as on the fortieth. No breach was ever effected in any work at Sebastopol, and the only reason why the Redan and Malakoff were not assaulted at the outset was, the desire to run the cover for the assaulting columns as close up to the works as possible. London fortified in the same manner, with Woolwich Arsenal to draw on for guns and ammunition, would furnish a r[???]llying point for the whole of the v[???]r force, and a retreat for the regular army, in case they were worsted in an encounter with the invader on the coast, against which two hundred thousand of the best troops in the world would have to make at least a long halt.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Defence of London.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Defence of London.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8304fe00-f764-5b5a-b2c0-d0be8b482a05,1042,nyt://article/8304fe00-f764-5b5a-b2c0-d0be8b482a05,

The conscription to swell his forces had been ordered by decree for the 18th of June, and on the 20th the conscripts were to take their departure for Catania and Palermo. The rumor, which reached us by a provious arrival that a number of GARIBALDI'S troops had dismbarked in calabria is pronounced to be untruc. The capture of the two steamers, with 800 passengers, by the Neapolitan frigate Fullminantc, is likely to cause the Government of FRANCIS II. Some trouble, as the Sardinian Minister had demanded their restitution and the release of the passengers, who had passports for Malta. In this demand the Sardinian Minister was supported by the English Ambassador. One of the captured steamers is stated to have displayed American colors. The conference of Sovereilgnsat Baden-Baden closed on the 17th and its results aare said to be eninently satisfactory. Both the French and the Prussian journals declaare that the pleaace of Europe is now consolidated and insured. The civil war in Turky up to last accounts still continued. Thirty-six villaages at Mount Lebanon are stated to have been burnt by the Druses, who have been the victors. The Turkish authorilties have not interfered, and the soldicrs who had been sent to protect the chrilstians had joined the Druses and partilcilplatedi ln the massacre. There is nothing of interest from other points. No change of importance had occurredd in money affairs. Consols were quoted at 93 1/2 @ 93$ fo;r account, ex divildend.

The murder was perpetrated at Randolph Station on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. One GOSSETT, was so offended by the request of an inoffensive old man, DAVIS by name, to lend him his pipe, that he seized an axe, and with one stroke sank it to the helve in the forehead of DAVIS. Another blow fell on the back of his bead, and the brains oozed out. Another blow cut off one of DAVIS' ears, and still another laid his eye open. Perhaps the diabolical ruffian would have continued his fiendish work, but Mr. FRANCE, a wood contractor, arrested him, took from him his weapons and secured him. Mr. FRANCE left him in charge of some of the men while he went to see his wife, and during his absence the men foolishly set GOSSETT at liberty. The villain then became so dangerous that the men were compelled to hide from him, fearing lest he should attack them. Matters remained in this condition until Mr. FRANCE came to Louisville late Saturday night to lodge the proper information with the Sheriff for GOSSETT'S arrest. DAVIS was alive when he left, but was evidently rapidly dying. GOSSETT during the evening was about the house where his victim lay dying, fierce to get to him, swearing that he would cut off his head.

"On Friday evening the Board of Police Magistrates met in the room of the Clerk of Special Sessions, at the Tombs, and consulted upon various matters connected with the business of the Police Courts. The Committee on Correspondence to whom had been referred a communication from the District Attorney, requesting that the complaints in all criminal cases should be sent to his office once a week instead of once a month as has been the custom, made a report. They stated that the law made it incumbent upon the magistrates to send the papers in criminal cases to the proper Court at the term following the finding of the complaints, and as the terms commence on the first Monday of each month, it was the duty of the magistrates to make their returns on that day. They recommended, however, that the Justices facilitate the business of the District Attorney by every means in their power, and advised application to the Legislature to so modify the law that the magistrates may comply with the District Attorney's request. The report was adopted, and a copy of it was ordered to be sent to the District Attorney. The Superintendent of the Work-house sent a communication expressive of the good results of the recently adopted rule of sending drunkards to the Workhouse instead of confining them in the Tombs. They now, instead of passing the term of their confinement in idleness, were made to work, and their services were of value at the Island. He recommended the magistrates to commit habitual drunkards for a longer time than ten days, if they had the power, as, by such a course, the community at large, as well as the prisoners, would be benefited. Under the present system, a large proportion of the number imprisoned for drunkenness are released, to return to their evil ways, and in a few days are brought back again. The communication was referred. A resolution was adopted, calling upon the City Inspector to substantiate a charge made in his recent report, to the effect that the magistrates invariably discharged all persons brought before them for throwing garbage in the streets. They deny the impeachment, and state that in the course of a year scarcely a dozen persons are complained of for the offence, but in every case where the charge is substantiated, the prescribed fine has been imposed.

The management accounted for it by saying that a large number of those who had intended to be present had gone up to the Fifth-avenue Hotel, where Mr. Douglas was to be serenaded, in order to obtain a good position for hearing his speech. Nevertheless, the meetings were large, and the enthusiasm great. During the meeting considerable excitement ""was occasioned by the entrance of the Empire Club, headed by JAMES lRVING, and accompanied by a brass band.

"Mr. CORNELIUS VANDERBILT, vulgarly known as the ""Commodore,"" having slapped the faces of the citizens of New-York for years with impunity, if not with positive applause, having amassed a colossal fortune by the ruin of innumerable competitors, and achieved a wide-spread reputation by a constant affectation of sympathy with the class from which and upon which he has risen to his present position, has at last made up his mind that he may safely undertake to deal with States as he has long dealt with individuals, and that he may soar from the monopoly of inland ferries and coasting routes to an open despotism over the highway of nations. We are a little curious to see in what way the patient community of New-York and the submissive Government of the United States will receive this latest and loftiest flight of the great commercial vampire which they have fostered and fed so long. Yesterday morning a number of packages containing newspapers and letters were sent down by various parties in this City, to be carried on board a steamship belonging to him, and advertised to sail for Panama. By the orders of the owner, the officers in charge of this vessel refused positively to receive those packages on any terms and under any pretext, and they were accordingly sent back. The immediate object of this proceeding was not so much, perhaps, to inflict loss and injury upon the individuals directly concerned -- though it is but fair to say that from the past history of the chief actor, it is quite reasonable to conclude that no opportunity of disturbing or damaging any man's business ever finds him indifferent -- as to put a constraint upon the American Government, which should crush that body into accepting Mr. VANDERBILT, at his own terms, as the sole mail-carrier between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of our empire. The immediate effect, however, of the step, is, unhappily, not a matter of speculation. It cuts off at one blow every nerve of commerce, and of intercourse between the American people of the Atlantic and their brethren of the Pacific. It interrupts the natural course of mercantile exchanges for a period which, in this day of swift and impatient negotiations, may, indeed, must prove, long enough to embarrass hundreds of firms and to ruin many bright hopes. Men do not deliberate over commercial transactions in this age and country as they did in the Holland of our ancestors. The success or failure of great enterprises has now become, in myriads of instances, a mere question of time; and there exists no Government so despotic that it is not bestirring itself to recognize and act upon the vital importance to the welfare of the State of speed and certainty in the transmission of the public mails. Even in moments of anarchy disturbers of the public peace who spare nothing else spare the mails which hold society together. The first act of the French Republicans of 1848 was to secure the regular departure of all the mail coaches from Paris, even before the provisional authorities had fairly learned who they were and what had happened. Other considerations than those of commerce, too, have made all civilized nations agree in punishing the mail-robber with the like exceptional severity that was meted out in the times before MACADAM to the horse-thief. The man who wilfully arrests the tarnsmission of a single public mail deliberately risks inflicting upon an indefinite number of his fellow-creatures all the keenest mental tortures and the most perilous moral suffering which human nature can endure. He puts himself between the dying and their friends, between the mother and her children, between the sinner and his repentance, between the prodigal and his pardon, between the home which deems itself ruined, and the word of hope which might restore it to itself and to the world. Whenever such a deed as this is done on any scale large enough to challenge the attention of society at large, every man's own experience flashes upon him a sudden and appalling sense of the unmeasured miseries which must follow it. A few years ago, when TUCKERMAN, for the sake of providing himself with the means of carrying on his own business systematically, intercepted the mails between Boston and New-York, was discovered, arrested and sentenced to an imprisonment of twenty years, everybody felt that the punishment could bear no assignable proportion to the enormity of the mischief which the criminal had done.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/03/archives/murdering-the-mails.html,,"Mr. CORNELIUS VANDERBILT, vulgarly known as the ""Commodore,"" having slapped the faces of the citizens of New-York for years with impunity, if not with positive applause, having amassed a colossal fortune by the ruin of innumerable competitors, and achieved a wide-spread reputation by a constant affectation of sympathy with the class from which and upon which he has risen to his present position, has at last made up his mind that he may safely undertake to deal with States as he has long dealt with individuals, and that he may soar from the monopoly of inland ferries and coasting routes to an open despotism over the highway of nations.

And Judge BETTS holds it as well settled law that, if they can establish before a jury that they never consented to the delivery of the bond to the United States in its present shape, but only gave it to FOWLER to get CHARLICK's signature, they are not liable on the bond, and he grants an injunction to stay the Government's proceedings until that question is determined.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fowler Defalcation The Sureties Likely to be Released.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fowler Defalcation The Sureties Likely to be Released.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a42ae1a-1161-56ae-8ab5-aec75dc995e1,899,nyt://article/2a42ae1a-1161-56ae-8ab5-aec75dc995e1,

"A feud which has existed for a long time between the members of Engine Company No. 21, lying in Worth-street, near Church, and Engine Company No. 13, whose house is in Duane-street, culminated last evening in a very serious riot.

Mr. LEALS, Editor of the Temperance Crusader, was amusing the crowd by improvising verses, in one of which he was so unfortunate as to mention Gen. BYNUM in connection with a young lady to whom he seemed to be particularly attentive. No sooner had he committed the blunder than a brother of the young lady managed to inform Mr. LEALS that he had given great offence by his allusions. Ample apology was at once made, but Gen. BYNUM was not satisfied with this. After dinner, while Mr. LEALS was sitting on the piazza, the General made his appearance, with a cane in one hand and a pistol in the other, and at once proceeded to administer to Mr. LEALS a flagellation with the hickory. He struck him only three blows, but these were severe enough to confine Mr. LEALS to his bed for two or three days. In a newspaper controversy which Mr. LEALS, who is connected with the Atlanta Intelligencer, subsequently had with Mr. HANLEITER, of the Crusader, the latter taunted him with having received a cowhiding at a public watering-place. A peremptory challenge was the result. The affair terminated with the following note, which Mr. LEALS justifies him, he thinks, in terming Mr. HANLEITER ""an impudent and cowardly scoundrel.""

"The mystery attendant on the double murder in the Eighteenth Ward, of Messrs. WALTON and MATHEWS, continues to increase in interest. On Monday night, after his brother EDWIN had been arrested, CHARLES JEFFERD, by the advice of a friend, proceeded to the house of Justice OSBORN for the purpose of giving himself into the hands of the law for-examination, but that magistrate, very singularly, told him to go away, and call at the Police Court in the Tombs on the following morning. Accordingly, yesterday, at the opening of the Court, JEFFRED appeared, and was committed to prison, to await the result of the Coroner's inquest. He asserts his entire innocence, and denies all knowledge whatever of the murders, protesting that he can prove an alibi.

"-- The Rocky Mountain News tells of the following tragedy recently enacted in Jefferson Territory: MARCUS GRIDLER, a native of the Tyrolese, in company with JACOB MILLWE, his wife, and other emigrants, left Leavenworth for Denver City on the 26th of April. GRIDLER and MILLER quarreled frequently on the road, and particularly; about their camping places. When about six miles from Denver, the quarrel was renewed, MILLER struck GRIDLER with a whip, and the latter seized an axe, knocked the former down, and shot him while lying on the ground. GRIDLER, having arranged with those who witnessed the tragedy to testify that the deed was done in Self-defence, proceeded to Denver City, and on the 14th of June surrendered himself to the authorities. A meeting of the citizens was called the following day; a jury formally impanneled, judges appointed, an attorney selected to prosecute and another to defend; witnesses were called, sworn, examined and cross-examined; pleas were made and a formal charge to the jury delivered by the Judge; and after decent deliberation; a verdict of murder in the first degree rendered. The Judges, after consultation, sentenced the prisoner to be executed the following day (Friday) between the hours of 10 and 5 P. M., and the sentence was ratified by a vote of the people. A scaffold was erected near Cherry Creek ; two reverend gentlemen administered to the spiritual concerns of the culprit; the Jefferson Rangers escorted him to the place of execution, where, in the presence of a concourse of over four thousand people, the sentence of the ""Court"" was carried into effect -- the prisoner having first confessed his crime from the scaffold.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/04/archives/lynch-law-on-the-borders.html,,"-- The Rocky Mountain News tells of the following tragedy recently enacted in Jefferson Territory: MARCUS GRIDLER, a native of the Tyrolese, in company with JACOB MILLWE, his wife, and other emigrants, left Leavenworth for Denver City on the 26th of April.

"-- The execution of NATHANIEL HARTEN for the murder of Miss MELISSA MORRIS, took place at Moundsville, Marshall County, Va., on Thursday.

The rope was then adjusted about his neck, the cap drawn over his eyes, Sheriff REED pulled the trigger, and the next moment HARTEN was swinging in the air.

He is now at home in Rathboneville, quite ill from rough usage and exposure. He states in substance that he left home on the 11th of June last with about $1,500 on his person, intending to transact business on the line of the Erie Railroad, also at New-York and Newark, and that immediately after taking dinner at Turner's Hotel, Oswego, he felt very unwell, and was conscious of nothing more until he recollects being struck on the head because he would not get into a small boat. How long he remained unconscious at that time he does not know, but when he recovered he found himself out at sea in a small coasting schooner, robbed of everything except his watch, which he carried in such a manner that easily escaped detection. The vessel was an old foretopsail schooner, painted black. Mr. BUNN thinks that there was a large patch on the foretopsail. The captain was a man of middle size. He thinks he would know him. When Mr. BUNN would ask any question in relation to his whereabouts the only answer he would receive was: ""Your fare is paid, Sir."" The crew consisted of six or seven men, with whom he was allowed no conversation whatever. After being at sea six days they neared land, and he ascertained that they were on the Coast of Florida. He was put ashore in a small boat, after solemnly promising not to speak to one of the hands in the boat. Fortunately, he reached a planter's house before night, where he was kindly cared for, and after he had sufficiently recovered, was furnished funds with which he returned home. From the state of his system Mr. BUNN thinks that he was a drugged at the hotel where he took supper, at Owego. He does not think the hands on board the schooner knew anything about the transactions on shore, or in fact anything regarding him, except that he was a passenger. He will visit Jersey City as soon as his health is sufficiently recovered to bear the journey.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jersey City.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Jersey City.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12ec1ccc-0838-5fdf-9377-6dd2c5447e76,449,nyt://article/12ec1ccc-0838-5fdf-9377-6dd2c5447e76,

"Coroner JACKMAN was summoned to the Eleventh Ward Station-house, on Wednesday afternoon, to investigate the circumstances attending the death of a woman, probably 23 years of age, who had been confined in one of the cells under the supposition that she was intoxicated.

Yet no contrast can be more striking than that which exists between the cleanly pavement and pure atmosphere of Fifth-avenue and the regions of Union-square, and the noisome stench that rises from the filthy gutters and assails the nostrils of any chance pedestrian through not only the thoroughfares in the vicinity of the docks, but many of the cross streets in the upper part of the City, between the most frequently traveled avenues. The difference in the habits of neatness which characterize the rich and the poor does not afford sufficient explanation for this different condition of the quarters they respectively inhabit. If the poorer classes use the street gutters as cesspools, it is not to be inferred that they would not appreciate marble basins and bathing-tubs, with plenty of Croton in their chambers, quite as well as the more wealthy who can afford such luxuries. If the absence of these conveniences forces them to turn the streets into receptacles of filth, it is only a stronger reason why the proper authorities should pay especial attention to the purification of those streets. A person who could pass from Seventh to Eighth avenues, on any of the first dozen streets above Twenty-fifth, and not wonder how human beings can breathe such a fetid atmosphere and live, would do well to put himself on exhibition as a phenomenon, destitute of either the organ of wonder, the sense of smell, or both. On any of the hot days of last week, when the street gutters, almost boiling beneath the burning heat of the noontide sun, sent up fumes of poisonous stench, could the twenty-one Sanitarians who went to the Boston Convention, have passed through the thoroughfares mentioned above, they would have gained more information concerning the needs of the City, and certainly have better earned the money which they pilfered from the City funds, than they did in the expensive pleasure-trip to the modern Athens.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sanitary Condition of the Streets.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sanitary Condition of the Streets.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/51a33b2a-a43f-5fc6-9d47-795a2c0b94d4,575,nyt://article/51a33b2a-a43f-5fc6-9d47-795a2c0b94d4,

It is positively asserted that a number of brigands had been dispatched to attempt his assassination. The Government troops were being concentrated at Messina, and a desperate effort would probably be made to retain that city as a new base of operations. It was reported that a proposition had been made to restore the two American steamers captured by the Neapolitans, but that the American Minister had demanded reparation for the insult to the American flag. A rumor prevailed that the Neapolitan Council proposed to grant a Constitution, a general amnesty, a change of Ministry, and a free Press, and to enter into an Italian confederation with Piedmont, but the proposition lacked the coasent of the king, who was reported to be ill. With reference to the conference of sovereigns at Baden-Baden, various rumors were afloat, but nothing definite seemed to be known as to what had been done. The most significant fact announced in this connection is the withdrawal of the French troops which, previous to the Conference had been concentrated on the Eastern borders of France.

At 12 o'clock the enter Sacrems and Warriors, and others not belonging to the Society, in all numbering about 70, congregated in the hotel, and soon afterwards the doors of the Council Chamber were thrown open and the chiefs and friends of the Society entered. At 1 o'clock the Grand Sachem, JAMES CONNER, took the Chair, and the exercises were commenced with music by Shelton's Brass Band. The Declaration of Independence was then read by Brother JOHN T. HOFFMAN, and followed by the band playing ""Hail Columbia."" The address was then delivered by Hon. JOHN COCHRANE. He referred, in commencing, to the peculiar condition of political affairs in the country, and to the duty of the Society -- that duty which it had always fulfilled, of meeting in council and endeavoring to restore harmony, whenever danger threatened, in the ranks of the great Democratic Party, which was the party of the United States. That party was now divided, and it was their duty to take counsel together as to the best means of restoring harmony among the brethren. He then gave a brief sketch of the rise and progress of the party, from the time of JEFFERSON to the present, claiming that it had always been the party of the people, and the great party of freedom of the United States. The fundamental doctrine of the party had always been, that all power came from the people, and that it should remain with them. That party had been found standing in support of all the great movements for the good of the people, and, therefore, its organization must be kept intact, for he claimed that party was necessary to the successful carrying out of any great idea, and that without party organization nothing effective could be done. He had declared before that it had always been democratic doctrine -- that Sovereign power was in the people and of right belonged to the people, and while their party organization was threatened with corruption, he advised them to stand by that doctrine, and by its representative, STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS, who, in accordance with the usages of the party had received the regular nomination for the Presidency of the United States. (Great applause.) He (Mr. DOUGLAS) had recognized that popular Sovereignty to which he had referred, and he had staked his fortunes upon the success of the democratic party; and therefore, as the regular nominee of the party, it was their duty there and then, to declare him worthy of their support; and that they would continue to support him until that support should culminate in complete triumph. [Applause.] In conclusion he recommended them to work for one organization, and for one man, until both should again prove successful.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SOCIETY OF ST.

"This somewhat celebrated match was played on the ground of the ""St. George's Club of Philadelphia,"" at Camac's Woods, Philadelphia, on July 3. The New-York Eleven comprised three professional players of cricket -- Hampshire, Sams and Crosley -- with Higham and Sharp as wicket-keeper and point; Wilby, Beach and Gillespie, splendid fielders; and Bray and Spivey, fine batsmen; Balliere, a good one to finish with. All of them being Englishmen, and successful cricketers. Against this strong team Germantown displayed an ""Eleven American Cricketers,"" whose ages only averaged twenty years, and at the conclusion of the day's play the score stood -- New-York, first innings, 113 runs; Germantown, first innings, 60 runs, with a loss of seven wickets -- two of which were thrown away by the batsmen's unnecessary hurry in sending their men to the wickets, in the darkness of the twilight, just before drawing the stumps. The fielding of the young Germantown players was of the highest order. They were agile and active at all points, and but few mistakes occurred, a chance or two being given by SHARP which might have been taken, and an easy catch by SAMS, from BARCLAY, to JONES WISTER at long filed off, was dropped after getting it in his hands; this gave SAMS a new lease for twenty more runs. The bowling of KEPHARDT, F. WISTER, BARCLAY, and LARGE was first-rate, but the ground was altogether too hard and lively for the bowling to tell with great effect. NEWHALL's wicket-keeping, while at it, was very good. That ought to have been his position throughout the match. SHARP's score, comprising two threes, three twos and singles, were well got, and caught NEWHALL at long-stop. SAMS made a splendid score of 35, giving but one chance out of a four, four threes, four twos and singles, finely played for to all parts of the field. CROSLEY played well for 26 -- in which was a four, three, five twos, and singles; and SPIVEY playing steadily for 13, consisting of three twos and singles, WILBY having a bad run out. Germantown was unfortunate in losing NEWHALL by a mistake on the part of JACKSON, (the Umpire,) an American cricketer, from Amsterdam, New-York. An off ball, which he had attempted to play, but let alone, glanced from his elbow into HIGHAM's hands and he was given out; his score of 17 was marked by fine play throughout, in which were 3 3's, 3 2's and 1's; BAYARD's score of 20 numbered in it 2 3's, 5 2's and singles, and was also well played for; CADWALLADER played brilliantly for a 4, 3, 5 2's and 1's; BARCLAY made a spirited couple of 2's and 2 1's; JONES WISTER being bowled out by SAMS in the twilight, after making a fine leg hit for 3. The total at sundown was 80 runs, and on account of the English and American match coming off on the 4th and 5th of July it was agreed to make it a drawn game; and a finer one has never been played on the same ground since the All-England match last September.

We endeavored to show, shortly after this opinion had been enunciated, that, whatever truth there might be in the charges made against our system of government, our material progress during the eighty-three years of our national independence was one long and splendid refutation of the allegation that the faith of the people in their laws had in the smallest degree diminished. Institutions which tempt immigrants to the tune of a million a year for three generations, to place themselves, their fortunes and their children, under their protection, under which commerce had been developed with a rapidity unknown in history, and under which enterprise bordering on rashness had become a national trait, might possibly be a failure, but nothing was more certain than that the people did not think so. Commercial caution is the characteristic of those who fear for the future. The dauntless courage which gives the wildest venture a temporary success is the product of the profoundest faith and the strongest hope. There is no test by which the confidence of a people in the political system under which they live, can be so surely ascertained as their readiness to invest their savings; and, judged by this, there is no people in the world less open to the charge of doubting the stability of their own laws than the American.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""American Institutions Tested by Experience Mr. Everett's Oration."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""American Institutions Tested by Experience Mr. Everett's Oration."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'INDEPENDENCE DAY (JULY 4)', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/05050b80-4b7b-5505-8f69-acc8a49302a4,1289,nyt://article/05050b80-4b7b-5505-8f69-acc8a49302a4,

"CARRIED OFF. -- A letter from Clifton, Ill., dated July 2, says: ""JAMES, WILLIAM and Mr. KINGMAN's JOHN were taken last evening by the slave hunters. They were all at SELLER's, (a store in Clifton,) enticed there by an Ashkum man, who was bribed by the kidnappers from the South. Mr. KINGMAN's NED and FRANK's WILLIAM succeeded in getting away. My WILLIAM and Mr. KINGMAN's JOHN were taken on the spot and handcuffed. JAMES made a desperate struggle and got as far as the railroad, when one of the men threatened, to shoot if he did not stop, and he was foolish enough to do so, for, had he kept on, he might have got away; but I presume he had been stunned by the repeated blows he had received on his head by a pistol. After getting them into a wagon, the man-hunters drove to Ashkum and took the cars there. A gang of men from Clifton were at the cars when I arrived, and we all went to Ashkum; but these scamps, twenty-five in number, were all armed with pistols, and we had no arms of any kind, so it was useless to resist them. The conductor of the train showed no disposition to aid us in any way, and I hope he did not favor the slave-drivers; but it looked very much like it. The Clifton men were scattered about town, and, as it was all done so quick, they had no chance to do anything. It is hard to submit to such things, I assure you.

"Early yesterday morning Officer Senior, of the Thirteenth Precinct, heard an explosion, accompanied with the crashing of glass in the provision store of Simeon Sage & Co., No. 183 Rivington-street. Suspecting burglars were at work, he obtained the assistance of several other policemen who surrounded the premises, while he looked for the place through which the rogues had effected an entrance. Presently he found the rear door had been pried open, and just as he was passing into the store he met a young fellow, named Henry Hawk, coming out. The officer at once secured him and took from him a full set of burglar's tools, consisting of a jimmy, brace and bit, saws, chisels and an assortment of lock-picks. An examination of the place showed that the explosion had been caused by the prisoner's attempt to blow off the lock of an iron safe, instead of succeeding in which he had managed to break off with the powder a corner of the safe, which was projected through the window and served to attract the attention of the Police to his operations. Hawks was taken before Justise BRENNAN yesterday, to whom he confessed his guilt. He also stated that he had been engaged in the commission of many burglaries, but never before had he taken so much pains for so little plunder -- it having cost him three hours' hard labor to force the door, and $2 in pennies being all that he had obtained up to the time of his arrest.

"About 2 o'clock yesterday morning a fire was discovered in the carpenter shop owned by Gen. DAVIS, and occupied by Mr. WM. HARLOE, at the foot of Main-street, Poughkeepsie. The firemen were promptly upon the spot, but in a short time the building was enveloped in flames, and all attempts to extinguish them were abortive, and the building and its contents were entirely destroyed. The latter were very valuable, and consisted of all the furniture of the new Episcopal Church, the finished and unfinished work of three or four other large buildings, and between thirty and forty tool-chests belonging to the workmen, worth from fifty to two hundred dollars each, a house-carver's tools, and a new twelve-horse power planing and sawing machine, with a variety of other articles too numerous to mention, were also included. The damage in this shop alone will probably reach $20,000. The flames also communicated to a pile of lumber in the lumber and coal yard of DUDLEY & THOMPSON, and in a short time the whole Yard was a mass of flame. The city was as light as day. The vessels near the docks were removed and anchored in the river for greater safety. The Exchange Hotel, kept by Capt. DANIEL H. TURNER, was liable at any moment to take fire, as well as the store-house of ROSEKRANS & GAYLORD, and the lumber yard of Mr. FOSTER, but they were saved by the exertions of the firemen. All the lumber, and a large quantity of the coal was consumed, together with the new office. This loss is estimated at from eight to ten thousand dollars, upon which there was an insurance of $4,500. On the other fire the building alone was insured for $1,500, the whole of Mr. HARLOE's property not being insured. Engine No. 6 was not at the fire, as she was in this City undergoing repairs. The fire was no doubt the work of an incendiary. At one time it was thought that all the lumberyards, the hotel, the vessels, and all on the dock, would be destroyed. When the fire was at its height, a steamboat passed Poughkeepsie, and on its arriving at Rondout, the firemen of that village were apprised of the conflagration, and at once chartered the steamer Columbus, and started for Poughkeepsie to assist in extinguishing it, but it was nearly subdued when they arrived there. The names of these companies are Lackawanna Engine Company No. 1 and Protector Engine Company No. 2. The kindness of their noble act was duly felt and appreciated. At 9 o'clock the fire was so far extinguished that three or four companies retired with their engines; but in about an hour the alarm was again given, the fire having broken out afresh; but so exhausted were the firemen, that horses were procured to bring the engines back.

When the fire was at its height, a steamboat passed Poughkeepsie, and on its arriving at Rondout, the firemen of that village were apprised of the conflagration, and at once chartered the steamer Columbus, and started for Poughkeepsie to assist in extinguishing it, but it was nearly subdued when they arrived there. The names of these companies are Lackawanna Engine Company No. 1 and Protector Engine Company No. 2. The kindness of their noble act was duly felt and appreciated. At 9 o'clock the fire was so far extinguished that three or four companies retired with their engines; but in about an hour the alarm was again given, the fire having broken out afresh; but so exhausted were the firemen, that horses were procured to bring the engines back. The fire then was speedily overcome.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Destructive Fire in Poughkeepsie.; LOSS NEARLY $30,000.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Destructive Fire in Poughkeepsie.; LOSS NEARLY $30,000.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/383c35e8-2c45-55b4-82ab-67e7097ba054,481,nyt://article/383c35e8-2c45-55b4-82ab-67e7097ba054,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/07/archives/an-awkward-dilemma.html,,"The position of being between the upper and nether millstone has long been proverbially unpleasant. Perhaps new forms of old ideas are all that we can expect in these days. Certainly, that idea remains the same, when put into the shape of being ""between a Collector and a District-Attorney,"" an instance of which our readers will find in our law reports this morning. It seems that in January last, a him of this City imported a lot of plate-glass, of which they made entry at the Custom-house, valuing it at about $4,400. The Custom-house appraisers raised its value to upwards of $7,000. This appraisement was naturally distasteful to the importers, who appealed from it, and on a new appraisal, by merchant appraisers, it was cut down to about $5,400, and, thereupon, the Collector, in April -- for all these proceedings had taken some time -- instituted a suit to forfeit the glass for undervaluation. This suit, of course, was brought in the United States District Court. The importers, being desirous of having their goods to use in their business, applied to the District-Attorney, stating that they wished to give bonds for the value of the goods and take them, and would fix the value at either of the appraised values, as he should choose. ""Oh, no,"" says the District-Attorney, ""I don't know anything about those appraisements. You must have new appraisers appointed by the Court, under the statute, to get at the amount for which you must give bonds. So, after some further delay the new appraisers were appointed by the Court, and they fixed the value at about $4,200, being less than the invoice value. For this amount, then, the importers gave their bonds, and then went to the collector to pay him the duties, and take their goods. ""Oh, no,"" says the collector, ""I don't know anything about that Court appraisement, and I won't take your duties, nor let you have your goods, unless you give bonds to the amount of the highest of my appraisements."" The importers thereupon apply to the Court to help them, but the Court says, ""I have no power to give you your goods unless you furnish a certificate from the Collector that you have paid your duties, and if the Collector won't give you one, I can't make him. Your case seems to be hard, but the act has not given me the power."" What is an importer to do in such a case? Certainly such an arbitrary exercise of power does not exactly consist with our republican ideas. The Collector might as well have required bonds in five times the appraised value of the goods as in the amount he did. That officers of the Government who apply to the Courts to aid them in enforcing the laws, should refuse to be governed themselves by the laws, which relate to the proceedings in Courts, and shield themselves behind the lack of power in the Courts over them, cannot but have an injurious effect upon a people too prone to avoid or refuse obedience to authority.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Awkward Dilemma.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Awkward Dilemma.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b0ba0d06-8685-5369-b638-d3cd9bf4a17b,622,nyt://article/b0ba0d06-8685-5369-b638-d3cd9bf4a17b,

As Constitutional Government had existed in England for four hundred years with great success, and had been found during the whole of that period productive of far more strength and prosperity than any other kind, and as the Prince himself owed his wife and his allowance to its triumph, this declaration of his Royal Highness' views was generally considered on the whole a still stronger indication of impudence than of bad taste. More recently HUMBOLDT's publication of the Prince's opinions upon the wrongs of the Irish and the Poles, revealing the fact that he considers neither of them have anything to complain of, have confirmed many people in the opinion that he would feel a little more at home at Vienna than at Windsor.

On Friday night, however, there being a scarcity of grain, all hands, except HUGH MCLAUGHLIN, the watchman, left at 12 o'clock. How the fire originated is not precisely known. The watchman gave the alarm, and two ferry-boats steamed out and putting their pumps in motion threw heavy streams on the building, until the danger of being set on fire compelled them to retreat, drawing out several barges, and playing on the ferry house which was in danger of being ignited. The labors of the Fire Department were partially ineffectual, owing to the fact that the hose was imperfect and repeatedly burst. Manhattan Steam Engine Company of New-York came over, and it was chiefly through the admirable working of this machine that the new depot of the City Railroad Company on the opposite corner, which cost $30,000, was saved. The City Mills were destroyed with their contents, involving a loss, including steam engines, boilers, machinery, seven hundred barrels of flour, several thou-sand bushels of feed and grain, of about $35,000.

These appeals were also backed by Mr. BUCHANAN, who, it was repeatedly stated, was very anxious that the mails should go out as usual, and who pledged himself to make the -proper recommendation to Congress for the extra compensation. These missives were regularly sent, it is presumed, by Mr. ALLEN to Mr. VANDERBILT, who steadfastly refused to allow any mail matter whatever to go on board. It is said that Mr. VANDERBILT joined with the Pacific Mail Company in two propositions, viz.: one, to transport the mails for a fixed sum, say, $300,000 for the steamship service; the other, to receive the postages on the letters, and twenty-five cents a pound for the printed and free matter, but, in the absence of any law, the Department could not act. It is said that 98 per cent. of the mail matter last year consisted of papers and free documents, and that for this large proportion of the entire Pacific mail, only $30,000 was received by the Post-office Department. On account of the regulation requiring all letters to be sent by the overland mail which are not specially directed to go by steamer, a large proportion of letters have gone that way, leaving the heaviest and least profitable part to go by the Isthmus. The overland letter mail is also somewhat increased by a dodge which large numbers have adopted of sending their letters to St. Louis to be re-mailed, thus making the postage six instead of ten cents The Post-office Department has now arranged with VANDERBILT, probably on his own terms for the transportation of the Pacific mails tri-monthly, the service to begin on the 11th of July and continue to the 4th of March next, the condensation to be the postages and the said 25 cents a pound for printed and free matter, which he is to receive upon the recommendation of the Post-office Department, provided Congress are then ready to make the appropriation.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pacific Mail Service.; AN ARRANGEMENT MADE WITH MR.

It is a matter of some importance, no doubt, to Sicily and the Sicilians, that the receipts on this occasion should be large, and that the hand as well as the heart of New-York should be opened to the call of freedom in the Old World. But it is a matter of still greater importance to New-York herself that in this brave battle of free principles and popular right with the mo??? cruel and the blindest of despotisms, the American people should not be found indifferent to the sufferings and the struggle of a noble sister nation. As Mr. BUCHANAN very aptly and gracefully acknowledged on Wednesday last, in receiving the new Minister of France at Washington, our Independence Day recalls not only the gallantry of our fathers, but the sympathy also, warm, practical and all-important, which they met with in the hour of their trial, from foreign States. It may seem, perhaps, not a little strange to the future historian of our times, that while the Court of Louis XVI. should have sent its Lafayettes from the gilded circle of the OEil de boeuf, to flesh their swords in defence of the liberties of a knot of revolted English colonies, the opulent American Republic of 1860 should have furnished no volunteers to the toils and the triumphs of Italian independence. Certainly the enthusiasts of Democracy can hardly have looked for so total an abstinence from practical Quixotism among the youth of a nation which rejoices to believe itself the destined apostle of popular progress throughout the world; and it would do us no harm in respect either of our reputation abroad or of our self-respect at home, to see the American theory maintained in the face of Neapolitan bullets and Papal bayonets by a few chivalric scions of the Revolutionary stock.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Garibaldi in New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Garibaldi in New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d85b0145-55a9-5270-b514-8f53b6f97a21,503,nyt://article/d85b0145-55a9-5270-b514-8f53b6f97a21,

He said: ""The phrase &#65533;not carnal&#65533; comprehends all that a carnal policy might and would resort to, irrespective of God&#65533;s word. It comprehends not merely the employment of violent methods -- not merely swords and revolvers, and all the implements and stratagems of war, but political intrigues, parties, combinations of ambition and wealth, Satanic expediencies, bribes, and all the methods of influence and strength that men resort to whose dependence is not on God -- not on divine truth -- but who, on the whole, are under the guidance of the carnal mind, which is enmity against God.

By the last accounts, one of the bands of recruits have had a glorious fight amongst themselves, and when the gendarmes interfered, they turned upon them and gave them a thorough thrashing in the old time-honored fashion. Then the rations served out to them, however acceptable they might be to Catholics of more Southern latitudes, appear to be very much too light for stomachs trained to their work in Tipperary. To cap the climax, the Roman brigands, moved by the instigation of the devil, and not having in their hearts the smallest respect for piety, virtue and devotion to the Holy See, have fallen upon some of the Irish officers and the chaplain of the brigade, and, according to one account, coming from a Saxon source, left them upon the roadside in a state of nature. So that, on the whole, neither Italy nor the Italians, nor the Papal service, appear to be very satisfactory to the ""emigrants;"" and if the Liberal Party avoid exasperating them, we should not be at all surprised to see the whole Irish force doing good service before the close of the war under the tri-colored flag. They have gone to Italy to fight, and we have no doubt are bent on fighting somebody before they come home; but it must be remembered they belong to a race intensely sympathetic and susceptible, and we doubt very much whether their enthusiasm for His Holiness would long survive contact and intercourse with the masses of his subjects whose trials they will of course witness, and whose sufferings they will soon learn to pity.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Pope's Irish Recruits."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Pope's Irish Recruits."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e1f10f4f-89b9-56ad-bfe3-7648af7ff76c,1203,nyt://article/e1f10f4f-89b9-56ad-bfe3-7648af7ff76c,

The majority of the English players are so well known -- several of them having played against the Americans in their annual matches year after year -- that it is needless to comment on their style of play, and we refer to the score for their names and the result of their doings. For the new players who were selected by the English Committee to secure the supremacy of Cricket in their hands: first on the list, and the supposed great gun of the Eleven, was Sadler, who first made his appearance at Montreal last September as an All-England player, but who, for some reason, did not remain at Montreal while the match was being played, nor did he play in the subsequent International Matches, or accompany ""The Eleven"" on their tour. Second, is Mr. Brett, St. George's newly-imported English cricketer -- a splendid cricketer at all points of the game. Third, is ""Sams,"" renowned as one of the finest cricketers of the United States. Hampshire is fourth, and a first-rate imported English cricketer at that; the last two being professionals of the New-York Club.

Hallis is the professional of the Newark Club, and Barlow is the only Philadelphia English cricketer, and one of their best, his long-stopping being perfection.

"The adjourned sailing match of the 4th July Corporation Regatta, which was under the direction of the New-York Regatta Club, took place on Monday afternoon. Eleven working boats entered, of various lengths, from 19 1/2 feet to 17 feet, with no allowance of time for length. The course was from the Batten' to Bedlow's Island, turning from the southward to northward and back, a distance of five miles. The wind was from the west-southwest, which gave the boats a dead-beat to windward before turning Bedlow's Island, and the regulation, that the race was to be accomplished without oars or rudder, was the more interesting. The modus operandi by which this used to be done in old times, was that the boatman trimmed his boat on an even keel, and laid his course by sitting in the centre of his boat, and if he wished to keep his boat off he shifted his position a little aft; or, if he desired to sail near the wind, he shifted his position a little forward; in going about, head to wind, he, we suppose, gave a rap full and got good headway, and keeping the sheet in hand, jumped forward, by which he brought her head to the wind, letting go the sheet and hauling to windward as much of the foot of the sail as he could get held of by the foot rope, letting her head pay off, and then hauling taut the sheet, lay her course until required to go about again. In sailing with the wind free, trimming the boat by the head brought her to the wind; and trimming her by the stern payed her oft. Thus, wonderful as it appeared at the first blush to tyros in yachting, it was simple enough in practice to those who ""knew the ropes"" The start was a very pretty sight. The Julia led, but was upset on nearing the Battery on coming home, as was also the Jersey. A stiff breeze was blowing, and there was a rolling sea, which nearly swamped several of the boats.

"By the steamer Palestine, which arrived yesterday at Quebec, we are informed of the death ""of Mr. ROBERT BROUGH, at the early age of 32 years. His name is familiar to readers en this side of the Atlantic, more than are his acknowledged works, although by his contributions to Punch, and comic periodicals of England of lesser note, he has been favorably noticed here on many occasions, and many of his productions have beer, reprinted here. He was a native of London"", but at an early age was removed to monmouth, Wales, where his father opened: a brewery While young BROUGH was yet a boy, the Chartist outbreak headed by FROST, JONES and WILLIAMS occurred in which the elder BROUGH became involved, necessarily taking part with the Government a circumstance which nearly ruined him, as the people Monmouthshire would drink no more of his beer ROBERT BRCUOH, the son had then to shift for himself and tried his hand at portrait painting but finding that he had mistaken his vocation, attempted literature. In that he was more successful, though he never evinced the possession of powers which promised great fame and excellence.

On Friday morning, the 22d June, England, if we are to believe the English Press, was by no means sure that she could defend herself on her own soil against the attack of any daring and well disciplined foe. On Saturday evening, the 23d, England felt quite equal not only to the task of protecting her own kitchen-gardens and areas against the Gallic or Sclavonic hordes, but fully competent too to the grander duty of regulating the affairs of all mankind. In the interval between these dates, a force of young Englishmen, in arms equal in numbers to about one-half an ordinary Austrian corps d'armee, and glorious with fancy uniforms of every shape and every hue, had gone through the simplest military evolutions before the admiring eyes of all London on a holiday. Europeans familiar with the tremendous military arrays of the Continental States, and Americans accustomed from their youth up to the parades of the national militia, can hardly be expected to comprehend the extravagant ecstacies of delight into which the gravest organs of British opinion permit themselves to be transported by this very simple phenomenon.

Leave was granted by Mr. FRENCH, the exhibition was advertised, and a large crowd was the result, of which one fact was noticeable, that the majority were Germans, the women being as numerous and curious as the men.

We might, in that case, forbear to dwell on the extraordinary remissness of the Telegraph Company, in sending a Washington dispatch of June 30 to Saratoga so slowly, that an answer to it could not reach New-York before the 2d of July. We might also admire the reticence, or be amazed at the incapacity of Mr. HOLT in conducting a long negotiation with Mr. VANDERBILT on the subject of steam mail carriage, without once hitting on that one proposition which the law had intended him to make, and which it now appears Mr. VANDERBILT was in his heart longing to accept. These things are worth noticing, certainly, but of our own motion we should have been inclined to overlook them, in a perhaps extravagant wish to deal as gently as might be with a brokenhearted offender. But a document has come into our possession which makes it imperative upon us to challenge Mr. VANDERBILT's story of his motives and his actions, and even leads us to question alike the sincerity of his contrition and the good faith of the President's Washington organ in asserting, as it did on Saturday last, that ""Mr. VANDERBILT had shown much public spirit and confidence in the Government by his acceptance of its proposal.""

"The auction sale of the theatrical wardrobe belonging to the late WM.E. BURTON, took place yesterday, according to announcement, at the sales rooms of J.

There were scarcely one hundred persons present at any time during the day, and the purchasers were mostly confined to some half dozen theatrical managers, actors and costumers. A few ladies were in attendance at the opening of the sale, but they soon left, as did a majority of the spectators, after gratifying their curiosity in examining the costumes of a few of the leading characters in which Mr. BURTON was so popular. These costumes presented but a sorry sight as they hung there drooping upon a row of pegs, when contrasted with their appearance upon the jocund form of BURTON, as he personated the characters of ""Capt. Cattle,"" ""Mieawber,"" ""Aminadab Sleek"" and the ""Toddles."" The catalogue numbered 236 lots, and comprised the whole private theatrical wardrobe of Mr. BURTON, (82 pieces,) together with the entire wardrobe of the Chambers-street Theatre and all its appurtenances. There were costumes of all ages and nations from South American Indians to Japanese Kamis, and of every variety of character, from English Kings and Roman Emperors to Swiss peasants and American sailors. Besides the human costumes were the supposed habiliments of angels, nymphs, faries, mermaids, witches, imps and devils.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/11/archives/sale-of-mr-burtons-theatrical-wardrobe.html,,"The auction sale of the theatrical wardrobe belonging to the late WM.E.

A few ladies were in attendance at the opening of the sale, but they soon left, as did a majority of the spectators, after gratifying their curiosity in examining the costumes of a few of the leading characters in which Mr. BURTON was so popular. These costumes presented but a sorry sight as they hung there drooping upon a row of pegs, when contrasted with their appearance upon the jocund form of BURTON, as he personated the characters of ""Capt. Cattle,"" ""Mieawber,"" ""Aminadab Sleek"" and the ""Toddles."" The catalogue numbered 236 lots, and comprised the whole private theatrical wardrobe of Mr. BURTON, (82 pieces,) together with the entire wardrobe of the Chambers-street Theatre and all its appurtenances. There were costumes of all ages and nations from South American Indians to Japanese Kamis, and of every variety of character, from English Kings and Roman Emperors to Swiss peasants and American sailors. Besides the human costumes were the supposed habiliments of angels, nymphs, faries, mermaids, witches, imps and devils.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Sale of Mr. Burton's Theatrical Wardrobe."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Sale of Mr. Burton's Theatrical Wardrobe."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9a08953c-554f-5285-8cf9-c016d08c8db0,507,nyt://article/9a08953c-554f-5285-8cf9-c016d08c8db0,

The affair came near a bloody consummation yesterday afternoon. At about 1 o'clock, Ex-Councilman KERRIGAN passed into the Park, from Park row, and had proceeded up the flagged walk, towards the City Hall, for some distance, when, looking back, he saw Alderman Genet with two other persons walking towards the east side of the Park. He turned, and as the Alderman approached, drew a pistol, and taking deliberate aim at him, asked him if he was armed. He also told the Alderman that he was a villain and a sneak; that he had endeavored to ruin his sister, and that he (Mr. KERRIGAN) was determined to punish him. The City Father immediately dodged behind Mr. SHEPPARD KNAPP, to that gentleman's great discomfort, particularly as Mr. KERRIGAN kept the pistol aimed in his direction. A large number of persons ran rapidly to the scene, while the Alderman, keeping his friends between himself and the muzzle of Mr. KERRIGAN's Navy revolver, intimated that he was not armed, and retreated slowly, until he succeeded in exchanging a friendly tree for the body of Mr. KNAPP. Before this, however, a number of Mr. KERRIGAN's friends, who had been standing in front of Messrs. CROOK & DUFF's Dining Saloon, had crossed over, and were using every effort to induce him to desist from his purpose of shooting Alderman GENET for the present.

The semi-bituminous coal of the Cumberland regions, so peculiarly adapted to steamers, and used by the steamers of the Cunard and Collins lines, could be conveyed from Locust Point in lighters to Annapolis Roads, at a cost of about 25 cents a ton, thus effecting a saving of above $8,000 on the freight of the coal from Baltimore to New-York.

"9 and 10 o' clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the principal workshop at the car-works of Messrs. KIMBALL & GORTON, Twenty-first and Hamilton streets. The building, a stone one, 196 feet by 50 feet in dim ensions, and one and a half stories high, contained a large quantity of worked material, including the frames for fifty coal cars, ready to be put together, and much valuable machinery, some of which was put up recently at a heavy outlay. In consequence of the quantity of combustible material in it, and of the numerous windows being open, creating a draft, the flames spread rapidly, so much so that the workmen escaped with difficulty and were not able to save their clothing. In a few minutes the whole structure was enveloped in flames, creating a most intense heat and setting fire to a large amount of lumber on Twenty firs street, and rendering it impossible for the firemen to work there. From the principal workshop the flames extended to the blacksmith shop and the paint shop, both of which were destroyed with their contents including two cars, a large one for the Catawissa Railroad, valued at $3,000; the other for the Howard Express Company, worth $800. A large stone shop to the west of those; for the finishing of cars, containing a large number, was not retched by the fire. The principal workshop was totally destroyed, as was also all the valuable machinery in it Some of the lumber was saved in a partially damaged condition. The steam engine was in a fire-proof building, and was not damaged, except by water. The fire burned for several hours, during which time the firemen labored very actively.

We may as well frankly say at once, however, that we have little hope of any good to be effected by this very proper and praiseworthy step. Of course every sensible and respectable man in New-York who knows anything of the way in which his money is spent, and his interests looked after, by the Government we are supposed to have chosen for ourselves, knows perfectly well that Mr. CRAVEN, for instance, is now, as he has for many years past been, an officer wholly competent to the charge of the great aqueduct on which the health, the comfort, and, it may almost be said without exaggeration, the life of New-York, have now come to depend. Of course, too, every such person knows, that to transfer the control and management of this vital public work at this sea-son of the year to new and, necessarily, inexperienced hands, is to risk the whole water supply of the metropolis at the moment when it is of supreme importance to the public hygiene. Equally of course, it requires no great exertion of the intellect for any good citizen to understand that a Chief Magistrate who can thus deliberately trifle e with the welfare of the community, on the ground of personal offence taken by himself is, on his own showing, a man utterly unfit either to remove or to appoint any public officer whatever. Were Mr. CRAVEN lawfully held and bound to do homage to ""this our Caesar,"" and had he willfully neglected this great feudal duty, it would be an act of the commonest good citizenship, in our master, to overlook his own personal annoyance in the consideration of the general good. But Mr. CRAVEN, not being Mr. WOOD'S ""subordinate,"" cannot have been guilty of ""insubordination,"" and the Mayor's, pretended ""cause"" for his removal rests on the same basis with the enlightened determination of Mr. Alderman CORNELL, who, it seems, has resolved to vote against Mr. CRAVEN'S retention in office, whether he is or is not a fit man for his place, simply because he (Mr. CORNELL) does not like ""Mr. CRAVEN'S manners, and thinks him wanting in respect to Aldermen when they call on him."" What the errands of Aldermen usually are, when they call on the heads of tax-disbursing Departments, we all know, and it is just possible that the people of New-York may find something to commend in the independence of a public servant who fails to show ""respect"" to Ward politicians who invade his office with droves of pets whom they wish at once provided with posts at the public crib, Mr. CRAVEN'S destined successor, we may depend, will be exquisitely ""respectful"" alike to Alderman CORNELL and to Mayor WOOD, at least until after his confirmation in office. Once confirmed, he will belong to ""His Excellency"" alone, and the silly Fathers, who are so greedily bent on giving us a King Stork, will then perhaps find out that there is not room enough in the City Hall for him and them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mayor and the Aqueduct.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mayor and the Aqueduct.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/37dad99b-2d2d-5463-adce-c3ddb526692c,806,nyt://article/37dad99b-2d2d-5463-adce-c3ddb526692c,

The reputation for speed which this ship has already achieved; the splendid accommodations afforded; her great comfort as a sea-going steamer, and the wide popularity of her commander, have made the Adriatic a favorite vessel, particularly to tourists, who constituted a large proportion of the passengers on the present trip. Hon, JOHN F. APPLETON, Minister to Russia, Senor ESCALANTE, Spanish Minister to Mexico, Gen. HALSEY, bearer of dispatches to Germany and France; Bishop QUINLAN of Mobile, Rev. GEORGE B. CHEEVER and Rev. A.H. MEAD were of the number. A large party of the friends of the passengers assembled to take leave, and for an hour before she left the dock the Canal-street pier was a scene of considerable excitement. The mails were detained until the latest moment, and some uneasiness began to be felt on this account. When they finally reached the dock, it only remained to pass them on board, which was accomplished with unusual dispatch, and the ship shot out of her berth in splendid style. Guns from the neighboring steamers, including two from the Great Eastern, complimented her departure. A small steamer, having on board a party of the friends of Rev. Mr. MEAD, went down the Bay for the purpose of waving him a last adieu. A large number of Rev. Dr. CHEEVER'S admirers also accompanied him down the bay as far as Sandy Hook on boat d of the steamer May Queen, the Doctor first going on board of the boat at the head of the Canal-street Pier, and taking leave of his friends. Wm. GOODELL, OLIVER JOHNSON, Editor of the Anti-Slavery Standard; THEODORE TILTON. Assistant Editor of the Independent Rev. H. H. GARNETT, pastor of Shiloh Presbyterian Church and a considerable number of colored persons were on board. On the way down, an impromptu meeting was organized on the saloon deck of the May Queen, which was addressed by OLIVER JOHNSON, WILLIAM GOODELL, THEODORE TILTON and Rev. Mr. MATTESON, Mr. JOHNSON denounced in severe terms the article in the last Independent written by Rev, Mr, THOMPSON the Tabernacle Church, condemning Dr. Cheever's mission. He eulogized the Doctor as a noble man, a true minister of Jesus Christ, and one of the most steadfast friends of the slave in the United States, and he wished him God-speed in his mission to Old England in behalf of the enslaved in this land.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sailing of the Adriatic.; DEPARTURE OF DR.

However, they resolved not to be disappointed, and were about to hire another boat, when the arrival of the Vanderbilt was announced as the Malta Saloon. Quite a large party started immediately for the landing, and on arriving there, were again disappointed; for the vessel had not arrived at her dock, and it was thought she would not arrive there until morning. There was nothing left but to wait until morning, which they reluctantly concluded to do. In the meantime HEENAN and MACDONALD had left the ship, and taken quarters in Burns' Hotel, on Staten Island, where it was thought they would remain over Sunday. That impression caused quite a large number of people to visit Staten Island yesterday, who were curious to see him.

No weapon has been more powerful in the hands of Anti-Papal controversialists than the vast sums of money dispatched by the Roman propaganda, aided by an Austrian missionary combination, to extend the area of Catholicism in this country; and the amounts obtained from ardent disciples of LUTHER and CALVIN as a competing capital wherewith to repel the monetary warfare of the seven-headed monster have been of the most satisfactory character. Indeed, every attribute of national and sectarian jealousy has been called into the liveliest activity by this standard old story. The Pastoral indicates that this state of things has come to an end. The tide has turned. American Catholicism is invoked to aid the Papacy struggling for existence in Europe; and the current of sanctified bullion no longer passes from the Old World to the New, but flows backward in the path of Empire. No longer are Roman scudi and Austrian florins to extend the cords and strengthen the stakes of the Church of St. Peter in the wilderness of the Far Wesi. The blood which has so long poured from the heart to the extremities, now seeks the origin of pulsation; and there will not be wanting shrewd observers who will predict death as the inevitable physiological result of this new action.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Pleader for the Pope.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Pleader for the Pope.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/86df50de-115a-524d-b0b5-478ccd6b7ab2,675,nyt://article/86df50de-115a-524d-b0b5-478ccd6b7ab2,

He flatly denies having charged Protestants, on that occasion, with hostility or indifference to the cause of education. We can only say that every report of his speech which has appeared -- that of the Tribune amongst the number -- confirms our statement. He alleged distinctly that "" New-England was the only Protestant community which had done anything to encourage education;"" and he sought by a piece of the clumsiest sophistry to impress his audience with the belief that it was a more creditable achievement to have "" founded"" Oxford and Cambridge in the eighth or thirteenth century, than to have maintained them in brilliancy, in honor, and in efficiency during the last three hundred years. He cited them as instances of Catholic devotion to learning, but he studiously avoided ail allusion to the fact that these two Universities have won almost all their fame in Protestant, hands; that it is as Protestant institutions -- exclusively and intensely Protestant -- that they have trained hundreds of the greatest lights of science and literature which the modern world has seen. We do not assert that they might not have revolutionized philosophy in Lord Bacon, and natural science in Newton, if they had remained Catholic, though when we consider the persecutions to which Galileo was subjected by Italian prelates in his lifetime, and the angry denunciations heaped upon the earth's rotation, in our own days, by an Irish Archbishop, we might well be pardoned some doubts on the subject. But if a Catholic Archbishop must be illogical enough to sneer at Protestants for not establishing Universities before there were any Protestants in existence, he surely ought to be honest enough to mention that they have made an able use of those which Catholics bequeathed them, and that every great seat of Catholic learning which fell into their hands can show a host of illustrious names on its lists of heretical graduates.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Archbishop Hughes and Protestant Colleges.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Archbishop Hughes and Protestant Colleges.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bac164d3-f057-51da-81ca-c71bb59dfb9f,1275,nyt://article/bac164d3-f057-51da-81ca-c71bb59dfb9f,

He and his disinterested confederates fear the Douglas faction will out-number them in votes, and thus claim future ascendancy in the organization, unless they devise immediate steps. The defection of that modern Brutus, FERNANDO WOOD, has grieved them sorely, especially as he was supposed to be 'national' to the back-bone, and stirred the hearts of the chivalry at Charleston with protestations exceeding the devotion of YANCEY. It was my privilege to be within earshot of his 'Excellency,' -- as Lord JOHN RUSSELL, with a charming deference to the Spanish-American custom, styles him -- on several occasions when he 'stood by the rights of the South,' and to have been an eye-witness of the scene when he entered the hall of the Seceders, and was invited to take a back seat. The new alliance with DOUGLAS is quite refreshing, all things considered, and does one good now that the dog-star rages so fiercely. There is reason to suppose that Mr. WOOD did not dine at the White House, on his last visit here. Perhaps he may have had a plate at the other end of the town, where the rival rose blooms outside the sunshine of power. Mr. BUCHANAN has evidently lost much of his affection for the Mayor, at which intelligence the country will, of course, put on sackcloth and ashes.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Political Miscellany.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Political Miscellany.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b9beeae-87bb-54c8-afd6-b2dd6c8af0fd,1855,nyt://article/9b9beeae-87bb-54c8-afd6-b2dd6c8af0fd,

It was also claimed that the defendant Shanettes was for a long time proprietor of the hotel, and that recently Shanetts, in consideration of certain advances to the amount of $14,000, proposed to be made by Langley, had agreed to take him (Langley,) into partnership in the business, and give him half of the profits of the business, half the property of the hotel, and half interest in the lease, the lease to still remain in the name of Shanetts, subject to a mortgage of $8,000, held by John T. Shanetts, upon the furniture of the hotel, which Langley agreed to assist, as is alleged, in paying off Thereupon a short agreement of copartnership was entered into between the parties, by which Langley at present should receive only half of the net profits of the house. This agreement was based upon the condition, that when Langley should pay in the amount proposed, (as he had then paid in but $600.) then full articles of copartnership should be entered into, and Langley should become joint owner of the hotel. The defendant claims that immediately after the $600 was paid in by Langley, Messrs. Whitney & Bonner, who claimed to have advanced that sum to Langley, came to him and demanded to be repaid the $600. He avows that he paid it out of his private purse.

"-- The literary scandal excited at Paris by Madame GEORGE SAND&#65533;s quite unprovoked attempt to carry out EMERSON&#65533;s theory of genius, and ""grind up her friends for paint,"" bids fair to become a very war of Troy for tediousness. It began with Madame SAND&#65533;s romance of Elle et Lui, in which she drew under the very thinnest disguise a most unflattering portrait of ALFRED DE MUSSET, then hardly cold in his premature grave. PAUL DE MUSSET, the accomplished brother of the deceased poet, perfectly familiar with the secret history of ALFRED&#65533;s relations with the authoress of Indiana, took upon himself the fraternal duty of relating that history in quite another light. His work, entitled Lui et Elle, is a marvel of keen, concentrated and sustained indignation, altogether merciless in its analysis of the heroine&#65533;s character and career. This fraternal vindication was rapidly followed up by another defence of ALFRED DE MUSSET, from the pen of a distinguished female writer. In her novel of Lui, Mme. LOUIS COLET has fully rivaled Mme. SAND&#65533;s own power of passionate description, and deals so unreservedly with the egotistical side of that lady&#65533;s nature, as almost to move the reader&#65533;s compassion towards a selfishness so mercilessly scourged. These blows took effect, and in the preface to her latest novel, Jean de La Roche, Madame SAND takes occasion to protest rather scornfull, against the tremendous inquisition which has been instituted into her past experience. The whole battle may now be presumed to have been fought out, and M. DE LESAIRE accordingly undertakes the task of historian, and sums up its record and its merits in a critical work, L'Histoire d'un Scandale, which is not the least interesting contribution to letters made by this most miserable quarrel.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/20/archives/minor-topics.html,,"-- The literary scandal excited at Paris by Madame GEORGE SAND�s quite unprovoked attempt to carry out EMERSON�s theory of genius, and ""grind up her friends for paint,"" bids fair to become a very war of Troy for tediousness.

The line of the procession ultimately decided upon -- the Rue Rivoli, Place de la Concorde, and the Pont des Invalides -- enabled the greatest number of people possible to have a good view of the gorgeous pageant: The Tulleries gardens, which it was for a time feared would be closed, were kept open as usual, and the terraces which command .the Place de la Concorde and line the railing of the Rue Rivoli, were closely packed from an early hour. The Place de la Concorde itself was not so full as I have often seen it on an illumination night: but still the troops and National Guards were hemmed it on either side by very dense masses, occupying, perhaps, half the vast arena. The shops were not generally closed, and although nothing could be more respectful than the attitude of the crowd as the coffin passed, there was nothing at all like that universally pervading sentiment of a really national mourning such as has been witnessed on former occasions -- at the funeral of the Duke of Orleans for instance.

"It is hard to quarrel with men who have so evidently tried to do their duty to the public as have the Coroner's jurymen impanneled to investigate the peculiarly appalling and mysterious murder of two citizens of New-York, in the open street and early on the night of the 30th of June last. And yet it is impossible, we think, for any candid person, unoppressed with the severe responsibilities of the jury-box, not to feel, on perusing the evidence offered in this case, that the finding which has committed CHARLES JEFFERDS, the stepson of one of the murdered men, to prison, there to await the further action of the Grand Jury, is hardly one in which he should have cared to concur. All the circumstances of this atrocious crime, so far as they were developed on the investigation in the form of facts, were strongly calculated to impose upon judicial inquirers the utmost reserve in condensing from them the terrible charge of murder against any individual whose name has thus far been brought forward in connection with the affair. Not a single witness, even of those who had enjoyed the fullest opportunities of observing the murderer before, during and after the murders, came forward prepared to testify to his identity. Some of them, indeed, thought they recognized in CHARLES JEFFERDS a certain vague resemblance to the shadowy shape which had flitted before their eyes on that calm Summer night, bearing in its hand the lives of two human beings. But though everything that could be done was done to nerve and fortify these dim impressions into sharp and positive forms -- though CHARLES JEFFERDS passed no small part of his time in putting on and putting off the ""light coats"" which it was hoped would fill at once the blurred and tremulous outline lingering in the memory of the witnesses -- yet no one person ventured to step beyond the cloudy frontier of general notions, and fix the finger of Nathan upon the suspected man.

And yet it is impossible, we think, for any candid person, unoppressed with the severe responsibilities of the jury-box, not to feel, on perusing the evidence offered in this case, that the finding which has committed CHARLES JEFFERDS, the stepson of one of the murdered men, to prison, there to await the further action of the Grand Jury, is hardly one in which he should have cared to concur. All the circumstances of this atrocious crime, so far as they were developed on the investigation in the form of facts, were strongly calculated to impose upon judicial inquirers the utmost reserve in condensing from them the terrible charge of murder against any individual whose name has thus far been brought forward in connection with the affair. Not a single witness, even of those who had enjoyed the fullest opportunities of observing the murderer before, during and after the murders, came forward prepared to testify to his identity. Some of them, indeed, thought they recognized in CHARLES JEFFERDS a certain vague resemblance to the shadowy shape which had flitted before their eyes on that calm Summer night, bearing in its hand the lives of two human beings.

HOUSTON is not to be the man. There met on Wednesday at Schenectady a Convention claiming to represent the State, and aiming to nominate an electoral ticket, which should represent the views and purposes of the zealous friends of the Texan. A round score of delegates made their appearance. The usual forms of organization had scarcely been perfected, when it became painfully apparent that a bare majority was addicted to him of San Jacinto; the sturdy minority having declared predilections for BELL and EVERETT; and the individual most conspicuous in conducting the proceedings being a rejected member of the State Convention which placed the Tennessean in nomination. There were, in these circumstances, obvious difficulties in transacting business. It was easy to nominate Capt. STOCKTON for Vice-President -- Capt. STOCKTON is the proscriptive dummy at all these snug little political games -- but when it came to naming an Electoral ticket of thirty-seven names, representing all the Congressional Districts of the State, and the State itself, it was inexpressibly mortifying to find that not more than eleven persons, all of whom were present, were assuredly loyal to HOUSTON; and what were these among so many? It was soon stated, not without pathos, that the City and County of Albany contained no adherent of the hero; a statement happily refuted by the President of the Convention, who, asserting himself as the lone star of that locality, indignantly quitted the chair and the assembly, by way of vindicating his fidelity to the cause. Then a Committee of Research to discover the lacking and too diffident candidates for the electoral honor was appointed, and the Convention -- it cannot be said to have adjourned -- exploded in utter confusion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The People's Candidate."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The People's Candidate."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8162e7f2-4013-5072-a1aa-17d4b596e84d,764,nyt://article/8162e7f2-4013-5072-a1aa-17d4b596e84d,

"REMARKABLE SELF-SACRIFICING CONDUCT OF A NEW-YORK SERVANT GIRL. -- The Ballymena (Ireland) Observer, of the 2d of June, records the story of the doings of an Irish girl, whose parents formerly resided in the neighborhood of the town in which that journal is published, substantially as follows: Her father, WM. MCCORD, a shoemaker and tenant of a small farm near Ballymena, died in circumstances of pecuniary embarrassment some years ago. At the time of his death his liabilities amounted to nearly &#163;40, and his family were left without a shilling for themselves, or any means for the liquidation of these debts. Soon after his death, about the year 1853, his daughter, ANN JANE MCCORD, then scarcely 20 years of age, emigrated to America, where she obtained employment as a domestic servant. Having from the outset determined to pay every farthing of her dead father's liabilities, she hoarded the small earnings of her industry with the utmost care; and, after six years of incessant toil, her noble aspirations were crowned with success -- her ardent desire was accomplished, and the grand aim of all her self-sacrificing exertions was fully achieved. On the 9th of February last, she sent a letter from No. 99 West Twenty-fourth-street, New-York, remitting to Mr. JAMES MCCORD, of Castlegore, a bank order for the sum of &#163;40, to be distributed by that gentleman in payment of her father's debts. The aggregate sum due was &#163;34 3s. 3d. In a postscript she directed that one MCHENRY should be paid five shillings over the amount of his debt, and that the balance of the remittance, &#163;5 11s. 9d., should be presented to her sister, Mrs. MARGARET WILSON. When the account was written, Mr. MCCORD had complied with the directions of the letter in every particular. The same account says that the payment was entirely unexpected on the part of the creditors, and the act exhibits an example of high and generous principle, for which the name and memory of ANN JANE MCCORD deserves to be honored in the place of her nativity, and it might have added, in every other land.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/20/archives/general-city-news.html,,"REMARKABLE SELF-SACRIFICING CONDUCT OF A NEW-YORK SERVANT GIRL. -- The Ballymena (Ireland) Observer, of the 2d of June, records the story of the doings of an Irish girl, whose parents formerly resided in the neighborhood of the town in which that journal is published, substantially as follows: Her father, WM.

They Claim that the Democratic Party is more devoted to principles than to men, and that no doctrine has been more frequently reaffirmed than than of non-intervention by Congress with Slavery in the Territories. No valid excuse has ever been offered by which any delegate from New-Jersey to the National Convention could be absolved from obligation to support the nominee of the Baltimore Convention, and they have witnessed with surprise a recommendation signed by the Chairman of the Central Committee that they should join hands with the Seceders. They ""deny the right of the Committee to make any such recommendation, and repudiate all such attempts to seduce them from their allegiance to their principles which are National, and their candidates, who coming from the North and South, and joining hands cordially upon the platform, prove to us that their hearts beat to the only national sentiment, 'Non-intervention.' They ask their Democratic friends in New-Jersey and the Union to stand fast to their National Platform, and their gallant standard bearers, DOUGLAS and JOHNSON, and repel all efforts, come from what source they may, to induce a combination with BRECKINRIDGE and LANE, as they would with LINCOLN and HAMLIN, viewing them alike as sectional. In Rahway, on Wednesday evening, a meeting was held to appoint delegates to the State Convention. Judge Savage offered a resolution instructing the delegates to vote against a Union ticket. After a long and exciting debate it was laid on the table by a close vote. A portion of the Douglas men then withdrew, and appointed delegates to contest the seats of those elected by the rest of the meeting.

Divided equally among the entire force, the Japanese windfall would give about $8 to each man but the equity of such a distribution is questionable, when the fact is taken into consideration that the extra work was only entailed upon a few. A suggestion has been made that the whole amount should be expended in the purchase of a uniform coat for each policeman, as many of the force are sadly in need of new garments of that description -- and still another suggestion has been made to parcel the money into amounts of $500 each, and have a lottery.

The General was about to receive large supplies, both of men and stores; about 2,000 men were to sail for Sicily from Genoa, where great numbers of volunteers are assembled; and a French house is said to have taken a contract for some thousands of revolvers, rifles and muskets, for GARIBALDI's service. Naples, at latest dates, was tranquil, and the proclamation of martial law had been rescinded. The Neapolitan Assembly, it is stated, is convoked for the 10th of September. The Constitution of 1848 has been proclaimed anew, and its restoration has been accompanied by the reestablishment of the Press laws enacted in 1848 and 1849.

"Three negroes living near Clifton, Iroquois County, Illinois, were kidnapped on the 2d. The local papers give the following account of the transaction.

"ROLL, the master of the negro boy whose sudden disappearance created so much excitement in Newark, New-Jersey, a few days ago, has offered $100 reward for the recovery of the fugitive. The Advertiser says: ""We learn that the slave boy has an uncle in Brooklyn, and it is supposed that his relative concocted the plan for freeing him. It has been ascertained that some blacks in this city went to a Justice in this City on Saturday and asked his opinion concerning a plot to free the boy.

But for the exertions of two Frenchmen, this spot might have remained marked with white, instead of black. As it is, letters must be inserted in the new maps, and foot-notes will tell how two white men explored the unknown territory; how one relinquished his task, leaving it but half done, through sheer exhaustion of body and inability to endure further suffering; and how a more adventurous countryman of his took up the thread where it was dropped, and unraveled the mystery which his predecessor vainly strove to solve. The first of these adventurous men was the Frenchman ARNAUD, who traveled under the assumed name of Hakim-Yusuf, (Doctor Joseph;) the second was DU COURET, a Colonel in the French service, who came to be known as Hadji-Abd'el-Hamed-Bey. Both ARNAUD and DU COURET essayed to explore the mysteries of Central Arabia, but the former fell fainting by the way, having pushed so far only as the City of Mareb; while the latter penetrated to the Indian Ocean, and, making his way safely back to France, sat down to write his story of travel and adventure. A reduction of the French narrative of Les Mysteres du Desert into the prosaic English dress which brings the tale before us, under the unpretending title of Life in he Desert,* sets forth a curious array of Asiatic pictures. The novelty of the incidents, the freshness of the style, and the newness of the field explored, lend a peculiar charm to this story. It is, perhaps, well enough to remember at the outset of our reading that a French traveler is nothing if not a romancer; that the national characteristic is a tendency to exaggeration; and that grains of salt must be freely sprinkled over the dainty meats here provided for our table.

Justice CONNOLLY, it will be remembered, after listening to the affidavits of the officers of the Pacific Steamship Company, thought proper to fix the security necessary to the prisoner's temporary release at the handsome sum of $22,000. If the recognizance was designed to cover the losses suffered by the Corporation, or to bear any proportion to them, it is needless to say that five times that amount would have been inadequate. Such, however, could not have been the view of the committing magistrate; and in any other, never was bail more excessive. The family of the prisoner is represented as not in affluent circumstances; and former friends of men subjected to charges so overwhelming are not apt to rush forward with eagerness to their relief. Measured by the means within the prisoner's reach, directly or indirectly, the sum was merely absurd, and calculated to insure his incarceration through the long Summer. Moreover, the ill health of the captive is such that there is little likelihood of his renewing an attempt at flight; while it is at the same time so precarious that close and solitary confinement would probably act as fatally as a death-sentence. In these circumstances the sum required assumed a penal character; and but for the assumption which charity compels in favor of the Justice, it might be imagined he was rather yielding to a desire to gratify a supposed spirit of persecution on the part of the informers, than to satisfy the ends of public justice. It is reasonable, however, to acquit Justice CONNOLLY of so harsh an interpretation of what was doubtless a simple misapprehension of the spirit of the law.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VINDICTIVE BAIL.

Indeed, it was more than suspected that the garrison was all ready to pronounce in favor of JUAREZ. One regiment, which had been sent against a small force of the Liberals at San Augustin, had deserted the Church Party on the road. MIRAMON had been repeatedly defeated near Guadalajara, and his army was totally disorganized. At last accounts he was endeavoring to reach, the capital, where his prestige had become greatly damaged through his reverses. Another forced loan had been collected in the city, together with a ""contribution"" of one per cent. on capital.

"Isaac L.

At this interview Taylor first stated that he had both notes in his pocket, but after some hesitation, admitted that he had collected one of them, and handed Mr. Deming $235 of the amount, retaining the balance of $66 44, which he is charged with having embezzled.

Upon the information derived from those gentlemen he placed as full reliance as that which he would repose in statements coming from any member of that House, even from the noble and learned Lord himself. They stated that the Provisional Government, which had been much supported, and he might say nursed into existence, by the action of the noble Lord, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had violently gagged the Press, and would not allow a syllable to be circulated in opposition to its views. But now the Provisional Government was at an end, and as an immediate consequence a newspaper had been published by some of the most eminent men of liberal opinions in Florence, and had been in existence for the last six weeks. In that newspaper the statements made by his correspondents as to the misdeeds, the tyranny, and the duplicity of the Provisional Government had all been substantiated; and the agents of the Government, instead of attempting to deny the facts, had endeavored first to suppress the paper, and, failing in that, as a last resource they bought off the printer and other persons connected with the paper. The result was that the publication had been suspended for ten days, but it was now again in existence, and such was its circulation, and such was the credit attached to its statements, that it was now published daily instead of three times a week. The result of the discredit attempted to be thrown on the facts stated by his correspondents was that they had become matter of notoriety at Florence from being published by some of the most respectable inhabitants, As he had always foreseen, the only result of an interference in Tuscan affairs was that the Mazzinian party was now stronger and bolder than ever. The latest information which he had received mentioned that three committees for barricades were now established in Florence itself. The noble and learned lord seemed likewise to throw great discredit on what he had said with reference to the statements in the French papers. But those details of the atrocities which had been committed were all confirmed the next day in the other House by the noble lord the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He had not directly charged the Provisional Government with these acts, but he said they were done by persons acting under their authority; for, when the regular Government was overthrown, and was assumed by a person in the station of Gen. GARIBALDI, he had no right to permit the commission of outrages; and it was not sufficient to say merely that he had in no way connived at them. The reports from our own Admiral on that station declared Gen. GARIBALDI personally to be a man of great moderation; but he was certainly not in a position to hold diplomatic intercourse with our Government if he was unable to prevent these atrocious crimes.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ITALIAN REVOLUTION.; GEN.

In some instances dwellings have shared the fate of the woods, and their occupants have been compelled to fly for their lives. There are no less than four of these fires burning the most serious of which appears to be ten or fifteen miles southwest of the Weymouth station, on the line of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad. Between this point and some distance below Egg Harbor City the flames have extended, and south of the last named place there seems to be a semi-circle of burning woods. East of Egg Harbor City the fire has come up to the line of the railroad, and the ruins of trees are smouldering for some distance along the track. The travel along the road has not been interfered with by the fires, and it is not probable that it will be impeded. The fires have originated from coalings and from sparks from the locomotives. There is no possibility of the flames being extinguished until sufficient rain falls to accomplish it. At Atlantic City the fires assume a formidable appearance. The cloud of smoke, reaching a line many miles in extent, arises to such a height as to spread over the western heavens and beyond the zenith, and it gives the sun, during the last half hour of the day, a murky appearance. The extent of the fires may be judged from the fact that the smoke so plainly visible at Atlantic arises some twenty miles distant from there.

"Theodore Lynn, keeper of a boarding house at No. 2 Carlisle-street, in the First Ward, was yesterday committed for trial by Justice WELSH, on a charge of having attempted to kidnap John Rand, a German sailor, who had been stopping at his house. Rand declared in his complaint that the accused, with the design of sending him to sea against his inclination, approached him on Monday night, having a loaded revolver in one hand and a pair of handcuffs in the other, and threatened to shoot him unless he submitted to be ironed. Fearing that resistance would cost him his life, he yielded to the ruffian's demand, and after the handcuffs had been placed upon his wrists, he was led into a bedroom, where a rope having been ""rove"" through the irons, he was triced up to a ring- bolt, secured in the ceiling of the apartment. Officer Miller, of the First Precinct, was apprised of Rand's condition and went to release him, but Mrs. Lynn refused him admittance to the house, and he immediately made the facts known to Sergeant Johns, at the Police Station. Both returned to the boarding-house, and again demanded admission, which was a second time denied. Instead, however, of entering by force, which they had a right to do, Sergeant Johns shirked the responsibility and waited until the arrival of Capt. Silvey, his superior officer, for whom he had sent. When the Captain reached place the door was forced at once, and the almost exhausted sailor was released from his painful posture.

"About 10 o'clock on Monday night flames were discovered issuing from the lower part of the large paint factory at the end of Mill street, Poughkeepsie, owned and occupied by Mr. WEDDLE. An alarm was instantly given, but some time elapsed before the firemen could reach the spot, owing to its distance from the engine-houses. The contents being principally composed of oil, turpentine, varnish and other inflammable materials, the whole building was in a short time enveloped in flames. There were probably from seven to eight thousand persons at the conflagration, many of whom assisted the firemen, doing considerable service. The building was entirely destroyed, together with its contents, which consisted of a large stock of oils, paints, varnish, turpentine, &c, as well as the machinery, tools, benches, and other articles too numerous to mention. The owner being absent at the time, our reporter could not learn the exact amount of the loss, but it is estimated by others at from $20,000 to $25,000. It was a very large brick building, formerly owned by Mr. WINFIELD, and used as a silk manufactory. It was five stories high, with 50 feet front and about 150 feet in the rear. Another factory of about the same size, adjoining, owned by PALTON BROTHERS, used as a carpet and pin factory, was damaged by fire and water to the amount of between $2,000 and $3,000. Mr. PELTON's is fully insured. The firemen worked with a will, and when it was found impossible to save the paint factory, turned their whole attention to the surrounding buildings, which were liable at any moment to burst forth in a blaze, so great was the heat. The wind was blowing quite freely during the whole time. The factory of PELTON BROTHERS caught fire in the roof by a blazing shingle failing upon it from the burning building. The grocery store and a dwelling house on the opposite side of the street had a narrow escape, and were badly scorched. The store was occupied by Mr. DORAN, the contents of which were much damaged by the water. Damage to building and contents $250. We could not learn whether there was any insurance on the building and property owned by Mr. WEDDLE. The fire was no doubt the work of an incendiary. Some four or five years ago, the carpet and pin factory adjoining the paint factory was entirely destroyed by fire, and the paint factory, then a silk manufactory, was damaged to the same amount that the carpet factory was by this fire; or, in other words, at a recent fire the damage sustained by the owners of the two factories was directly the reverse of that of Monday night.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/25/archives/destructive-fires-at-poughkeepsie-one-factory-consumed-and-another.html,,"About 10 o'clock on Monday night flames were discovered issuing from the lower part of the large paint factory at the end of Mill street, Poughkeepsie, owned and occupied by Mr. WEDDLE.

Mr. PELTON's is fully insured. The firemen worked with a will, and when it was found impossible to save the paint factory, turned their whole attention to the surrounding buildings, which were liable at any moment to burst forth in a blaze, so great was the heat. The wind was blowing quite freely during the whole time. The factory of PELTON BROTHERS caught fire in the roof by a blazing shingle failing upon it from the burning building. The grocery store and a dwelling house on the opposite side of the street had a narrow escape, and were badly scorched. The store was occupied by Mr. DORAN, the contents of which were much damaged by the water. Damage to building and contents $250. We could not learn whether there was any insurance on the building and property owned by Mr. WEDDLE. The fire was no doubt the work of an incendiary. Some four or five years ago, the carpet and pin factory adjoining the paint factory was entirely destroyed by fire, and the paint factory, then a silk manufactory, was damaged to the same amount that the carpet factory was by this fire; or, in other words, at a recent fire the damage sustained by the owners of the two factories was directly the reverse of that of Monday night.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Destructive Fires at Poughkeepsie.; ONE FACTORY CONSUMED, AND ANOTHER INJURED LOSS NEARLY $100,000.

"While the Christian world is ringing with the hideous echoes of the recent massacres of the Christians in Syria, and the most clamorous partisans of the Western Powers in the Crimean war seem ready to prostrate themselves in recantation and expiation at the feet of the Czar, it is, perhaps, hardly worth while to say even a single word in behalf of that strange people of the Libanus whose scimitars have done all this fearful work. Certainly there can be no doubt that the destruction of the Maronite towns and people is a flagrant and horrible proof of the utter incompetency of Turkey to fulfill the obligations which she accepted as the price of her existence, from the Christian nations at the peace of Paris. Certainly, too, it must be admitted that Christendom and civilization are alike disgraced by the diplomatic recognition of an empire in which the profession of Christianity puts its votaries practically beyond the pale of any law that can be enforced, and subjects them to the conditions of life in the primeval wilderness, where every man is his own police and court, and code. Yet when we reflect that Turkey entered into no engagements with regard to her Christian subjects, at Paris in 1856, more binding than those which were assumed at the same time and place with regard to the free navigation of the great central river of Europe, the Danube, by Austria; and that however short the Sultan has fallen of keeping his sovereign word, the Emperor FRANCIS JOSEPH has still more openly laughed at his own, we may well hesitate at indorsing in America the vehement language applied in Europe to the first of these defaulting potentates by journalists and statesmen who deal far more gently with the second. And however disagreeable it may be for English Senators and French Envoys to be forced to chat over the dinner-table with the Ambassadors of a State within the borders of which the age of GENGHIS KHAN is acting out once more, in all its historic terrors, it must not be forgotten that the same Christian gentlemen do not think themselves dishonored by the most familiar intercourse with the representatives of an Austrian Emperor, who is inflicting upon the Christians of Venice the utmost extremity of suffering and of insult; or of a Neapolitan King, who stands convicted of ordering with his own hand the wholesale slaughter and ruin of Christian cities in his own dominions. While Christendom consents to look on quietly and diplomatically upon the furious efforts of impossible Christian Governments to maintain themselves at the expense of all Christian liberties and all human rights in Europe, it seems a little hard, to say the least of it, that the death-penalty should he so peremptorily pronounced against a Mohammedan Government which is merely unable to protect those sanctities of civil order which the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons are doing their best utterly to annihilate.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/28/archives/the-syrian-massacres.html,,"While the Christian world is ringing with the hideous echoes of the recent massacres of the Christians in Syria, and the most clamorous partisans of the Western Powers in the Crimean war seem ready to prostrate themselves in recantation and expiation at the feet of the Czar, it is, perhaps, hardly worth while to say even a single word in behalf of that strange people of the Libanus whose scimitars have done all this fearful work.

About 6 o'clock last night, great excitement was caused in Hoboken by the announcement that a barge containing passengers was on fire in the river, and was heading for the shore. It was at first supposed to be an excursion boat in which event the loss of life would undoubtedly have been very great. It proved to be the steam barge T.C. Durant, Capt. SHOEMAKER, of Coeymans, Albany County, N.Y. She left her dock, foot of North Moore-street, about 6 o'clock, with some fifteen passengers, including six women and some children. Shortly after getting out into the river, a fire was discovered in the after part, under the main deck, near the boiler. The excitement amongst the passengers became very great, and the female portion ran about the deck screaming and acting in a most frantic manner. In a few moments the flames had made considerable headway, and in less than ten minutes the stern of the boat was enveloped in names. The Captain at once ordered her to be run ashore at Hoboken; and as they were on their way, the steamboat Shultz ran across her bow and attempted to take a line, but were unsuccessful. In the meantime, some of the less excited persons were engaged in preventing others from leaping overboard. The pilot succeeded in running the barge, alongside of a dock near the Yacht Club house. Some of the firemen were already present, and in a few moments all the passengers, who were clustered together at the bow, were safely landed, without accident. The firemen then directed their attention to battling the flames, which now raged fiercely, and by 7 1/2 o'clock had almost entirely extinguished them. The excitement in Hoboken for a while was very great, and men, women and children came running from all directions, until several thousand were assembled. There was but little freight on board, nearly all of which was removed. The boat was owned by Messrs. SHOEMAKER and JOHNSON, of Albany County, and is valued at about $12,000. The loss will probably be about $5,000, which is covered by insurance. The women, who came ashore without their bonnets or shawls, were kindly cared for by the citizens.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-Jersey.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-Jersey.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/59f95096-0e2a-5132-a3e4-b85d27f2ecc2,577,nyt://article/59f95096-0e2a-5132-a3e4-b85d27f2ecc2,

MAHONE, President of the Norfolk and Petersburgh Railroad, has come to the City to offer inducements for her to visit Hampton Roads, and the Norfolk Board of Trade have held a meeting and authorized its President to open a correspondence with the managers of the ship, to ascertain from them whether they would be willing to cooperate with the friends of ""direct Southern trade,"" by running their ship from the Chesapeake Bay to some port or ports of England, should it be found, after dilligent inquiry, that ample tonnage can be concentrated on that point for her profitable employment.

We dare say that KWTTI himself never speaks of Spanish pronunciamentos without a compassionate curl of the lip. But at least one Spanish orator has just earned the right to a very different reputation. When the news reached Madrid that the Spanish Pretender, the Count DE MONTEMOLIN, had retracted at Paris the renunciation which he had freely made in Spain of his rights to the throne, a member of the Cortes asked the Minister why her Majesty's Government had made no allusion to this important event. Here was an excellent opportunity for a magnificent burst of loyal and patriotic fireworks. The Minister might have invoked all the great ghosts of Spain, from PELAYO down, out of their graves; discussed the whole field of dynastic rights and popular sovereignty, and wound up with thrilling appeals to the Cortes and to the country to stand by the throne of ISABELLA and the Constitution. He did nothing of the sort, but getting up for a moment in his place, simply answered that ""Her Majesty's Government had published neither the renunciation of the Count DE MONTEMOLIN, nor his retractation of his renunciation, because the Government attached no more importance to the one of these documents than to the other;"" and thereupon sate down. Columns of eloquence in small type could not have conveyed so complete a sense as do these few words, of the power of a free constitutional government, and of the ridiculous impudence of the dynastic vagabonds who persist in pestering Europe and the world with the exhibition of their bigotry, their vanity, their selfishness and their dishonesty.

The result hitherto, however, has not been to secure an equal representation of all the States in the graduating classes as cadets, either from physical or mental incapacity, have been obliged to leave the institutions before finishing the course. This, heretofore, has been disadvantageous, not only to the boys thus disheartened but to the institutions, from a waste of time and the existence of many vacant scholarships. The classes were disorganized, and the energies of tutors to educate incompetent pupils have been literally wasted. The main cause of the misfortunes has been the loose manner in which cadets have been appointed -- through political influence, and not on account of any peculiar qualification for the places sought. Boys were catered as candidates for Army or Navy officers, without brain or muscle enough for a retail dry goods clerk, and were obliged to resign to their own disgrace and the great mortification of their parents. In order to obviate these evils, Hon. DANIEL E. SICKLES, member of Congress from the Third District, revived the plan adopted by Hon. HIRAM WALBRIDGE. Having the appointment of one cadet for each of the above-named institutions, he determined to choose them from the most fit and capable boys in the public schools. He accordingly addressed a letter to City Superintendent RANDALL, requesting him and his assistants to act as a Board of Examination of candidates to be presented by the schools of the District, the selection to be made ""not only as to their fitness for preliminary examination, but as to their ability, intellectually and physically, to sustain themselves in the long and difficult training which every pupil must undergo before he can; graduate from either of those institutions.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Public School Boys for the Army and Navy.; SELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR WEST POINT AND ANNAPOLIS ACADEMIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Public School Boys for the Army and Navy.; SELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR WEST POINT AND ANNAPOLIS ACADEMIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2165cf43-080c-585e-9349-8e06ce1ef0e6,471,nyt://article/2165cf43-080c-585e-9349-8e06ce1ef0e6,

The respective editors of the Memphis Avalanche and the Memphis Appeal have been carrying on a rather ardent correspondence, and though it has ended without resort to either pistols or broad-swords, one cannot but shudder to think of ""what might have been."" Col. GALLAWAY, of the Avalanche, feeling agrieved at an article in the Appeal, wrote the editors of that journel a note, saying that he regarded the article as grossly offensive, and peremptorily demanding whether they intended any personal reflections, or to question the veracity of any of the Avalanche corps, closing his note with the customary courteous information: This will be handed you by my friend, Col. GEO. H. MONSARRAT; to which the Appeal men replied that they had previously felt aggrieved at something the Avalanche had said, and that any explanation from them was impossible until they were assured that so and so was neither the purpose nor motive of the article in the Avalanche. They too closed their note in the recognized fashion; This will be handed you by our mutual friend, Co H. MONSARRAT. To this the irate GALLAWAY made answer that the article referred to only sought to weaken the political influence of the Appeal, and by no means justified an attack upon his own personal honor, concluding by reiterating his demand and stating: This will be handed you by our mutual friend, Col. MONSARRAT. The Appeal men immediately replied that this explicit disclaimer left them free to say that in their article they spoke abstractly, and did not design to involve or impeach the personal honor and veracity of any of the Avalanche editors in the concrete. ""This,"" they intimated, will be handed you by our mutual friend, Col. LEON TROUSDALE. This last note, like CHARLES LAMB's piece of oyster pie, ""did the business."" The impending Avalanche was averted, and an appeal to the field of honor on the part of the Appeal rendered perfectly unnecessary. Col. GALLAWAY instantly took his pen in hand to say that the note had been handed him by Mr. TRCUSDALE, and that it was perfectly satisfactory. That friendly relations were restored, and that this note, with intelligence to that effect, would be handed them by his friend, R.E. CHEW. The interesting correspondence was published in full, and each editor resumed his quill, feeling, no doubt, that he had done his duty to himself and to society. Poor Col.

The bills were urged through the Legislature in spite of the Executive veto, and in the face of the unanimous outcry of the City Government, which filled Albany with its remonstrances against the avarice and arrogance of those men, who proposed to take possession of all our great thoroughfares, without tender of compensation to the unhappy tax-payers. Seldom have the debates of both Boards, even when discussing questions the interest or which has been intensified by the dependence thereupon of choice and not inconsiderable bits of pecuniary plunder, been marked with more fervor and more hearty indignation than when the acts finally passed the Legislature. The promptitude and bits of with which a message from the acting Mayor, denouncing the laws, was received, and the Counsel of the Corporation ordered to contest their constitutionality, is a memorable entry in the journals of the Council, contrasting singularly with the action on Friday, when only a minority of four was found to oppose the resolution. The significance of this change is unmistakable. The managers of this stupendous scheme have made no secret of their intentions to convert the City authorities to their views; and rumors, not in the least incredible, have circulated for some time past, that when all the prearranged removals of impracticable City officials should have been effected, and the only additional barrier to progress should be the Common Council, that there would be no difficulty in inducing that body to cause the withdrawal of legal opposition.

The assortment is composed of varieties of wheat, barley, grape cuttings, olives, scions of fruits and vegetable products. The cuttings, scions, &c., will be sent to the new propagating houses for experiment and increase, and no distribution will be made of the remainder until Fall. Among the interesting plants may be mentioned the Lessaban. It is believed by many that the crown of thorns was plaited of the branches of this tree. It makes an excellent article for hedges, and thus has a positive value, independent of any such tradition. As a tree it is very ornamental. There are also seeds of melon, squashes, &c., camel's food, dates, walnuts, equal to the English, and probably well adapted to' the middle and Southern States.

These articles had been collected by desire of the late Commissioner of Patents Mr. HOLT, through the agency of his friend, Rev Dr. BARCLAY, who, by his position and knowledge of the Holy Land, was well qualified for the task. The assortment is composed of varieties of wheat, barley, grape cuttings, olives, scions of fruits and vegetable products. The cuttings, scions, &c., will be sent to the new propagating houses for experiment and increase, and no distribution will be made of the remainder until Fall. Among the interesting plants may be mentioned the Lessaban. It is believed by many that the crown of thorns was plaited of the branches of this tree. It makes an excellent article for hedges, and thus has a positive value, independent of any such tradition. As a tree it is very ornamental. There are also seeds of melon, squashes, &c., camel's food, dates, walnuts, equal to the English, and probably well adapted to' the middle and Southern States.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/30/archives/volunteers-english-and-american.html,,"An indignant Briton takes the world and ourselves rather sharply to task for laughing at the British Volunteers and their grand review in Hyde Park. It is a curious feature in the progress of the age, that the traits which used to be considered most characteristically American are disappearing on this side of the water only to come out very strongly among our trans-atlantic cousins. ELIJAH POGRAM himself, that terrible fellow who was always defying the despots of the earth and flinging back the insolent criticisms of an effete aristocracy into their own faces, seems to have crossed the seas and taken up his abode in the ""inviolate isle."" What with Mr. ROEBUCK, the ""ban-dog of England,"" and Mr. KINGLAKE, who is just as familiar with the secret designs of Louis NAPOLEON, as Mr. POTT of the Eatanswill Gazette was with the machinations of the Czar NICHOLAS; and the incessant thunder of the London Times against the wiles and the wickedness of France, Russia and the United States, our excellent English friends are fast invading our ancient monopoly of fluent Buncombe and cutaneous susceptibility. We are sorry to see this, for we have a very sincere respect for our kinsmen, and we think it hardly fair that, after taking so much pains as they have throughout our whole early history, to point out to us, in the most benevolent manner in the world, our little failings and follies, they should now refuse us the privilege of discharging our debt in kind, and fall into a rage with us for quizzing them when they are quizzical. It is not the fault of America surely that the British people are afflicted with what the Russian journal, Le Nord, very happily calls an ""intermittent fever of fear,"" or that being so afflicted, they are occasionally betrayed into ways and words which are too essentially absurd not to be ludicrous. If President BUCHANAN should review twenty thousand volunteers at Washington, and the American Press should thereupon announce that the United States were in a position to defy any foe, and begin to talk about regulating the affairs of mankind and improving the morals of monarchs, the American Press would do a very silly thing. Is the same thing any the less silly when it is done by the British Press on no better provocation? Our Britannic correspondent quite misses the real reason of the world's mirth over the Hyde Park demonstration. There is nothing contemptible in the attempt of England to put herself on a level with other powers in regard to her means of self-defence. On the contrary, it is highly creditable to the English people that they should frankly recognize the exposed and unprepared condition of their country, and energetically go to work to remedy it. But unless on Dr. JOHNSON's theory that ""most foreigners are fools,"" Englishmen cannot possibly expect the ""rest of mankind"" to be awed by a parade of twenty thousand more or less blundering militia-men before a Queen in a close-carriage, or to accept the first crude result of a hastily organized popular enthusiasm as decisive proof that England has at last determined to become a great military nation. The present volunteer movement in Great Britain is respectable as a movement only. It has been engineered into existence by a combined effort of the leaders of English opinion, and is still, as every thoughtful Englishman must admit, in the condition rather of a fashionable emotion than of an established institution. It may certainly become in time a permanent feature in English life, and it will then be rational for Englishmen to count upon it as an element of the national strength. To compare it now, as our correspondent does, with the militia system of the United States is simply absurd. The militia system of the United States is a tradition of our colonial history. It is fixed in the habits, tastes and character of our people and although it is no doubt a very good joke that Colonels are as plentiful in Tennessee or Texas as Counts in Germany or Italy, or Knights in the City of London, still it is a great mistake to suppose that this joke has not its very serious side. The forms of a vast volunteer army are maintained by our militia, system through-out the Union; the spirit with which these forms are animated, is a part of the popular life, and although the temper of the public mind in regard to military matters, ebbs and flows as it does in regard to everything else under the sun, the permanent fact remains that every American adult in every generation is availably within the reach of his country whenever his services in the field may be needed. It is the aim of the Englishmen who are at the head of the volunteer movement in Great Britain to make this which is true of America true of England also. Our correspondent thinks they have attained their aim, at least as fully as it is attained in America. We do not agree with him, and he has certainly fallen into some sad mistakes in respect both to the organization of the militia forces of the United States and the condition of the Volunteer movement in his own country. On the authority of the Army Register for 1859, he quotes the enrolled Militia of the Union at 2,100,000. That authority puts down the total force at 2,727,486. He impugns the efficiency of our Militia on the strength of its general and staff organization, quoting the Army Register to prove that California in 1857 had 18 Generals for every 11,500 men. The Army Register, indeed, assigns eighteen Generals to California, but gives them 207,400 men to command. In his haste to ""explode the American imposition,"" our correspondent has carried the 11,500 militia-men of Florida to the account of the Golden State. How he came by the still more extraordinary notion that the rifle is a weapon almost unknown to the United States, and that any man in New-York can ""count on his fingers all his friends and acquaintances who ever draw a ramrod from January to December,"" we own ourselves unable to imagine. It is a pure flight of fancy, only paralleled by the assertion that, of the 124,000 uniformed British volunteers, every man is ""carefully trained in company and battalion drill."" So far is this from being the case, that the Saturday Review, the favorite organ of the volunteer movement, in commenting upon the display of the elite of these volunteers before the Queen at Wimbledon, finds it necessary to deplore ""the fact that their movements generally showed some irregularity, and the spectacle -- painful to a military eye -- of some of them trailing, and others carrying, their arms as they moved in file in the actual presence of the Queen.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Volunteers, English and American.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Volunteers, English and American.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-07-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aa0b0c44-0855-5ba6-9867-349efe82ad37,1306,nyt://article/aa0b0c44-0855-5ba6-9867-349efe82ad37,
"On Saturday night Capt. Dowling, of the Sixth Precinct, assisted by Officer Riordan, arrested Richard Bavendaun, a German, who keeps a drinking-place at No. 45 Baxter-street, on suspicion of having murdered on the night of the 30th of July, 1859, one Juan B. Gustarino, a native of Gibraltar, who was found dead in the alley-way of No. 37 1/2 Baxter-street. Bavendaun was apprehended at the instance of Mary O'Brien, a woman of very bad reputation, who made the following statement to the Police: At the time of the alleged murder she was a tenant of the accused, who rented the house No. 37 1/2 Baxter-street, and sublet appartments to a variety of disreputable people, the majority of whom, however, were women of her class. On the night in question the induced. Gustarino to visit her room, and it was not long before she ascertained that he had a considerable sum of money in a belt about his waist. This information she communicated to Bavendaun, and they agreed upon a plan to murder and rob him. Accordingly she returned to her room, and soon afterwards Bavendaun came up and struck Gustarino with a club as he lay asleep upon the bed, until he became unconscious. His money was then taken from him, and after his coat and hat were replaced, the still insensible man was removed by Bavendaun with the assistance of Margaret Welsh, another of the occupants of the house, to the alley-way, and placed in a a sitting posture. Next morning he was discovered by the police in the position in which he had been left, and it was supposed that his death was the result of intemperance. Coroner JACKMAN, however, held an inquest upon the body, and Dr. John Beach made a partial post-mortem examination, which demonstrated that death had been produced by a rupture of one of the small blood vessels, which was very much diseased. A verdict was therefore rendered in accordance with the physician's testimony. The woman, O'Brien, stated to Capt. Dowling, that she removed from the house immediately after the murder, and that until recently she had been on friendly terms with Bavendaun. A quarrel having occurred between them, however, she had been prompted to avenge herself by yielding him into the hands of the officers. The only corroborating circumstance in support of her singular story is the record at the Coroner's office of Gustarino's death, but Coroner JACKHAN and Dr. BEACH believe it to be a malicious fabrication. No external marks of the alleged violence were visible on the person of the deceased, and this fact the doctor considered sufficient, after ascertaing that the blood-vessel had been fractured, to warrant him in waiving a thorough examination. As the case now stands, it is the duty of the District-Attorney to have the remains exhumed, and order a new investigation, by which means the charge would probably be either verified or disproved. Bavendaun was yesterday taken before Justice WELSH, who committed him to the Tombs.

"(N.Y.,) Banner says: The residence of RUDOLPH ROHR, in the town of New Bremen, was the scene of a most horrid tragedy, on Saturday and Sunday last. The following are the particulars as they were given at the Coroner's inquest: For several years past Mrs. LAURA ROHR, wife of RUDOLPH ROHR, was at times partly deranged, in consequence of religious excitement and dissatisfaction with her marriage relations. Early on Friday morning she came to the hay-field where her husband was at work, and informed him that the little boy (their only child, about four years old,) was missing. Mr. ROHR replied that he would go and look for him; she, however, insisted on his remaining at his work, saying she would find him. After a half hour might have elapsed, Mr. ROHR felt uneasy at the non-appearance of neither mother or child. He repaired to the house, found it deserted, and locking the doors, immediately commenced searching the neighborhood, without success.

The following are the particulars as they were given at the Coroner's inquest: For several years past Mrs. LAURA ROHR, wife of RUDOLPH ROHR, was at times partly deranged, in consequence of religious excitement and dissatisfaction with her marriage relations. Early on Friday morning she came to the hay-field where her husband was at work, and informed him that the little boy (their only child, about four years old,) was missing. Mr. ROHR replied that he would go and look for him; she, however, insisted on his remaining at his work, saying she would find him. After a half hour might have elapsed, Mr. ROHR felt uneasy at the non-appearance of neither mother or child. He repaired to the house, found it deserted, and locking the doors, immediately commenced searching the neighborhood, without success. On returning to his house he found one of the doors open, and upon looking into the bedroom, his little boy lay upon the bed, dead, with a note in the hand-writing; of his wife across his forehead, saying: ""The child died an easy death."" The mother could not be found. Some time after she made her appearance, looking very wild, and denying having killed the child. She stated that while engaged in praying with the child, he suddenly died. Saturday night she with other persons watched over the corpse of the child, appearing rational. About 6 o'clock.

"We have received from Messrs. FRAZAR & CO., of this city, a copy of their Japanese Circular, which furnishes us with dates from Nagasaki to May 1. Business had improved considerably, and the exports of tea, wax, seaweed, &c., show a marked increase. There had been a fleet of about a dozen whaleships, principally American, in port during the month of April, which had received outfits and repairs, and left again for the Japan Seas to cruise. Horses are daily shipped to Shanghai for the use of the Allies in China. The American ship Kate Hooper chartered by the French Government, takes 260 horses to Shanghai, and the bark Maryland also takes a quantity on French Government account. The English are taking up several large ships in China to send to Nagasaki as transports for horses, which are now being collected in Japan. In regard to exports it is stated that the arrivals of produce at Nagasaki from the country have been more extensive than ever noted before, and there is great activity displayed at the present time in shipping to Shanghai and Hong-Kong. A brisk business this Summer is anticipated, as the Japanese are more and more disposed to enter into contracts with foreigners for supplies for the Chinese and home markets. Japanese tea[???] are much sought after for the English and American markets, and the exports of these have increased very materially. The Vesper, an American whaler, was in contact off Nagasaki with the Amoor, Russian whaler, and both returned for repairs. The captain of the Amoor jumped overboard and was drowned.

"-- An attempt was made, on Saturday night last, to throw off the track, on the Worcester Railroad, the New-York Express train, coming east. The attempt was made about one mile south of the Framingham station, by placing several sleepers across the rails, which, in the darkness, were not seen by the engineer of the train until the locomotive was within a few feet of them, when it was too late to attempt to stop the train, then going at a high rate of speed. When the locomotive struck the obstructing sleepers all but one of them were thrown under the advancing train, without doing any damage. One of the sleepers, however, was caught between the side of the cow-catcher and the rail, where it was wedged so tight that it required nearly an hour to clear it from the engine. The most singular feature of the matter, and, indeed, it appears almost miraculous to the people in the train, was that not even the locomotive was thrown from the track, and not a person or car injured, although the passengers sustained quite a severe jar by the sudden stopping of the train. -- Boston Herald.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/31/archives/attempt-to-throw-the-newyork-express-off-the-track.html,,"-- An attempt was made, on Saturday night last, to throw off the track, on the Worcester Railroad, the New-York Express train, coming east.

"-- Messrs. TRACY and DANSE, messengers of the State Savings Institution of this city, were mysteriously deprived of a large sum of money while on their way hither on a steamboat, on Saturday night or yesterday morning. We give the details as furnished us by Capt. E.A. SHEBLE, of the Keokuk Packet Company's steamer City of Louisiana, which arrived in port yesterday morning, about 5 o'clock. Arriving at Hannibal, on her down trip, at 5 o'clock yesterday evening, the Louisiana was boarded by two messengers, who had just been to and returned from Independence, Missouri, having collected the sum of $33,000 specie for the paper of one of our branch banks located in that city. The messengers desired to have the money, $15,000, in one carpet sack, and $18,000 in another, placed in the boat's safe, but the clerks have a standing order to receive no large sums on deposit, as these packets always have a messenger of the United States Express on board. To that gentleman Messrs. T. & D. were referred, but after due deliberation they announced their intention of retaining the specie in their own charge, and accordingly they retired to their room, agreeing that one should watch while the other slept. The drowsy god, however, is no respecter of persons, and closed the eyes of both, the watcher being ensconced on a chair on the guard. At Cap-au-Gris, when the Die Vernon was met, the money was safe, but shortly after, about half-past one, Saturday night -- one of the messengers hurried along the cabin, found the porter, and had Capt. SHEBLE aroused from his berth, and informed him that the sack containing the $15,000 had disappeared, and another sack been put in its place. The sleeper had been aroused in the dar, suspected some person was in the room, and on quickly placing his hand on the shelf above him, where the sacks were placed, found that one was gone. Capt. SHEBLE instituted a search of all the passengers and every room and recess of the boat, but found not the smallest trace of the missing sack or money, and the messengers were in despair. On arriving here, information of the robbery was communicated to the police office, and officers were sent to prevent any person or thing from leaving the boat, while other officers proceeded anew to search the persons on board. The Detectives TUNNICLIFFE and RYAN were called, and they continued the search, extending it through the ladies' cabin. When things had been thus progressing fruitlessly for nearly an hour Officer EAGEN, of the City Police, came on board, and on learning the history of the case passed back through the gentlemen's cabin, in stateroom No. 25, between two mattresses, found two parcels of the money. Officer TUNNICLIFFE then found a third parcel in another berth of the same room -- the three parcels being the amount lost minus $100. The inference is that the thief or thieves adroitly transferred the packages from their persons to the berths while the search was proceeding, and after those berths had been searched, hoping that the money would remain undisturbed until the watch was relaxed when they could carry it ashore.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/31/archives/heavy-steamboat-robbery.html,,"-- Messrs.

Leese asserts that for a long time past an inexcusable intimacy has existed between Reed and his wife, and under these circumstances he had been forbidden to call at the house. Having gone home late on Sunday evening, Leese was astonished to find that the object of his hatred had braved his injunction, and was then enjoying the society of Mrs. Leese. Deeming the occurrence a matter that admitted of no explanation, he drew a pistol and pointed it at Reed's breast, but the cap failed to explode. Meantime the intended victim, in attempting to shield himself from the angry husband, stumbled on the stairs, and the misstep probably saved his life, for at that instant the ball from Leese's pistol whizzed above his head, and before Leese could commit further violence, he escaped. Leese was soon afterwards arrested, and yesterday he was brought before Justice QUACKENBUSH to answer a charge preferred by Reed of assault with intent to kill. In his examination he told his grievances, and added that the pistol was discharged accidentally. The circumstances, however, did not support his statement, and he was committed for trial in default of $1,000 bail.

"It is satisfactory to know that the Chinese authorities have at last resolved to discountenance the traffic in coolies. That the most horrible abuses have distinguished this trade is perfectly well known. In gross immorality and reckless disregard of life it is the rival of the Slave-trade. Hundreds of vessels annually leave certain notorious Chinese ports, laden with their living freight, and it is not even denied that a majority of the laborers are stolen from their homes, with the connivance and assistance of Government officials. The vessels, thus freighted, are under no legal obligations, and are bound by no contract. The masters or owners are at liberty to act as their own cruelty, or selfishness, or love of gain may dictate. In almost every case the ship is overcrowded, and the mortality on the passage frequently rises as high as fifty per cent. This immigration is chiefly carried on with the Chinchas and with Cuba. Peru, to her credit be it said, has, by judicious legislation, repressed the cruelty and avarice of her citizens engaged in the coolie trade; but Spain still offers every inducement to British and American vessels to prosecute a traffic which both British and American authorities have over and over again declared to be illegal. The immense demand for labor, and the hope of large gains, deaden the conscience of the Cuban proprietor to the voice of humanity. It is not to him that the world looks for the redress of this wrong; nor yet to Spain, who has evinced an utter disregard of public faith and of obligations that she solemnly bound herself to perform; but to the great Powers of Europe and America, who have not yet undertaken to arrest a practice so abhorrent to humanity, and so disgraceful to the civilization of the age in which we live.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/31/archives/the-coolie-trade.html,,"It is satisfactory to know that the Chinese authorities have at last resolved to discountenance the traffic in coolies.

Though we love rot the old things of England, it woke, we know not why, a strange sadness, to have to record their ruin. It seemed as if in sorrow for the departure of England's glory, and the surrender of that contempt for the Frenchman, which has been the earliest and strongest passion of the English heart, that these household gods had passed away.

"-- A most mysterious murder has lately occupied public attention in England. A factory inspector, living near Frome in Somersetshire, one morning missed his youngest child, a boy of about four years of age, from the cot in the nurse's room, where he usually slept, and after a tedious search, found his body thrust down the vault of an outhouse, with the throat cut from ear to ear, and a large stab in the region of the heart, evidently inflicted after death. The mystery enveloping the whole affair baffles even the famous detectives of London. This may better be appreciated when it is known that in one of the bedrooms slept the nursemaid, and in the same room the deceased in a little cot, and in another part of the room another child in a second cot. At five o'clock the next morning the nurse awoke, and missed the deceased. The impression of the child's body still remained on the bed and pillow, but the under blanket was gone, and the coverlid carefully folded down. The father and mother were applied to by the nurse, to know if they had removed the child into their bed, but they had seen nothing of it since the previous night. Further search was made, and the drawing-room door, window, and shutter -- all of which had been fastened on the inside the previous night -- were found a little opened. After a time the body of the poor child was discovered in his night-clothes, as above stated. Every inmate of the house was searched, but not a spot of blood, or the slightest clue tending to criminate any one in the commission of the crime, could be found. How an individual could have taken the child from his cot, placed the bedclothes tidily, carried him through the drawing-room, across the lawn, through a shrubbery and stable-yard, where a watch-dog was loose roaming about, thence into the water-closet, deprived the child of life, and decamped without leaving behind them the smallest clue to their guilt, or disturbing the inmates, or awakening the child, or coming into collision with the dog -- is a mystery which time alone can unravel.

As a whole, the Mutuals have not lost any credit by losing this game, while leaving on the score-book so good a fifteen, against such fielding as the Atlantics. The batting of the Atlantics was of the usual heavy kind, and was well met by the out-fielders, no home runs being made; but the in-fielding, and misses of different catchers behind, (changed as usual, was) rather muffy. The pitching was also lacking in effectiveness, Beard not filling that post as well as that of catcher. Taking these important shortcomings, and the changes in positions of the fielders, into consideration, it is a wonder they came out so well. Gavagan put two men out on a fine catch from the bat and throw to a base, and Taylor at right field deserved all praise; a carriage prevented his making a clear home run. The Atlantics' batting was generally first-rate, but P. O'Brien was not as successful as usual in the field. Where is it possible to find perfection at all times? Although all fielded finely, Smith, Pierce and M. O'Brien seemed to excel most. A collation was given to the Atlantics by the Mutuals, at which much interchange of good-feeling took place, and the ball was presented by Mr. Wildey, with some appropriate remarks, to Mr. Tassey, President of the Atlantics, who made most friendly response, which was received by both parties with cheers. The Press was not forgotten amid the hilarity; and the Atlantics departed with another trophy to add to the many well-earned laurels they have won.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/31/archives/base-ball-atlantic-club-vs-mutual-club.html,,"These Clubs played an exciting match on Monday, at the Elysian Fields, Hoboken, which ended in favor of the famed Atlantics.

"The wretched young King of Naples really seems to be working hard to save his throne. Thanks to the tremendous discipline which the success of GARIBALDI and the undisguised scorn of all Europe have administered to him; thanks, too, probably, to the counsels and the influence of his young and accomplished wife, a high-spirited Princess of Bavaria, who has evidently no wish to be the MARIE ANTOINETTE of Neapolitan history, FRANCIS II. is plainly bent on persuading his people, if possible, that they may trust his word, and that he really means to make them the arbiters of their own destiny. The steps which he has already taken are virtually irrevocable. By adjourning the summoning of the Neapolitan Parliament till September, the King has given time to the Liberal sentiment of Naples to look about itself, to take form and shape, to organize a party, and settle upon a policy. By September, Sicily will in all human probability have severed itself from the dominions of his crown, and have put itself under the protection of Sardinia. GARIBALDI will then have ceased to be a present power in behalf of the annexationists of the mainland, and a present peril to the Bourbon dynasty. If Neapolitan liberalism then decides on a violent political convulsion under his auspices, the ex-Dictator will have to begin again from the beginning, and land once more like CAESAR in a boat with his fortunes. It will then be a fair question for the Liberals of Naples whether they will accept the constitution of FRANCIS II., reduced as he now is to the same practical impotence for ill which has made a constitutional Queen of ISABELLA of Spain; or risk a general war in Europe by commencing at Naples a revolution which must inevitably spread to the Romagna and Venetia, or frankly vote the Bourbon dynasty from the throne and transfer their country bodily and peacefully to the crown of VICTOR EMANUEL. The probabilities with the balance of advantage are, we think with the third of these courses. Apathetic as the Neapolitan public has thus far shown itself at this great crisis of its fate, and hopelessly degraded as is the personal reputation for honor and good faith of the family to which FRANCIS II. belongs, it might yet be desirable for Naples to attempt a constitutional career of separate independence, were the condition of the rest of Italy satisfactory, or were her own resources equal to the emergencies which await every Italian State in the future. But while LAMORICIERE and ST. PATRICK keep watch over the Romans, and FRANCIS JOSEPH presses his bayonets to the heart of Venetia, no State of Italy can count on preserving her autonomy against the sweeping tide of Italian national war which must sooner or later break from its bounds, unless she is strong enough to sway that tide and to lead it. The loss of Sicily has made Naples too weak to dream of such a position, were she even as thoroughly united within her own borders and as well trained to political influence as Piedmont. When the great struggle comes, Naples must follow in the wake, not march by the side of Sardinia. Seeing this, the wisest friends of Neapolitan and Italian liberty must hope and believe that the coming Parliament of Naples will settle the problem before them by a quiet legislative annexation to that stronger State which has become in the Providential movement of history the head and heart at once of the Italian Peninsula.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/31/archives/the-state-of-naples.html,,"The wretched young King of Naples really seems to be working hard to save his throne.
