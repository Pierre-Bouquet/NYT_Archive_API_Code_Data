We look to them for the reconciliation and alliance of theory and practice -- for the culture of unlettered ingenuity in the laws and history of Science, and the putting of a speaking tongue into the dumb mouth of Rule and Formula -- for restraining erratic genius within the limits of practicability, and clothing the impalpable spirit of Theory with a working body and iron arms -- that Science may no longer shine under a bushel, and that Practice may no longer grope in the uncertain light of instinct and limited experience. It is too late to restrict the learned professions to three; a fourth, delving at an equal depth into the great unknown, and revolutionizing the whole world with its benefits, has taken the foremost rank among the allies of civilization. There is, indeed, a grim dignity in the old fashioned regime of classical culture, and a decoction of Greek roots is capital bitters for the youthful understanding, but there is a field not only for intellectual culture, but for intellectual achievement of the highest order, in the not less comprehensive, and rather more intricate theme of dynamics.

From the statements of parties who witnessed the occurrence, it appears that HALL, who is by occupation a ship carpenter and caulker, has for some time past led a very dissolute life, spending what little money he earned for liquor, and becoming very quarrelsome when under its influence. Yesterday he passed most of the day in the liquor shop in question, occupying himself in drinking and playing dominoes, and at the time of the affray which resulted in his death, he was much intoxicated. About 4 o'clock, one PATRICK MURPHY, a laborer employed on NICHOLSON's large box dry-dock, lying between Rutgers, and Pike streets, in company with JOHN MCCARTY, a fellow-workman went was into LOHMANN's for a drink. At this time HALL was standing at the bar, and MURPHY so excited his ire by accidentally pushing against him that he made use of very abusive language. MURPHY in turn became incensed, and an altercation ensued, which finally resulted in his receiving a blow from the drunken man. MURPHY, who is a powerful fellow, retorted by knocking his assailant down, after which he stamped with his heavy boots upon his head and chest, inflicting such injuries that he died almost immediately, the occurrence having transpired in such a brief space of time that the bystanders had no chance to interfere. MURPHY immediately started off, and, although the police were quickly apprised of the murder, and a large force was immediately dispatched in pursuit of him, he has so far eluded their search. Deceased much bruised and disfigured, was removed to the Station-house, and a physician having been called, he was examined and pronounced to be dead. An inquest will be held upon the body to-day. HALL, was a Scotchman, 35 years of age, unmarried, and boarded in Rutgers-street, near Monroe. MURPHY the alleged murderer, resides with his wife and three children at No. 379 Cherry-street. He is a rather good-looking Irishman, 26 years of age, and is said to be of a quarrelsome disposition.

Our latest despatches, however, seem to indicate that while in the towns heard from, constituting more than one half the State, Mr. SEYMOUR, the Democratic candidate for Governor, had made very heavy gains, they still fell a great way short of overcoming the Republican majority of last Spring; and unhappily, they embrace returns from the strongest Democratic localities.

There are three ""department"" offices to be filled, viz.: Collector of Taxes and Assessments, Street Commissioner, and Commissioner of Repairs and Supplies. For these offices there are four tickets in the field -- one Republican, two Democratic, and one, the ""Eclectic"" or American, composed of the Democratic and Republican candidates. An unusual amount of political labor has been performed during the past week, particularly by the candidates and their friends of the respective wings of the Democratic Party, and much bad blood has been created, threatening to produce a general row. Several collisions of a petty kind took place last evening -- one, at MCCARTY's barroom, just at the rear of the City Hall, bid fair at one time to be serious in its results. But the prompt action of the Police in arresting the principals in this disturbance rendered the attendance of a Coroner unnecessary. Last evening the ""Mozart Hall"" wing held a mass meeting at the corner of Grand and Second streets, E.D., when the principal orator of the occasion was Mayor WOOD. The announcement of his name brought together a large crowd of people, representing all parties. The managers of the meeting fortunately invoked the aid of a special police force, and the numerous turbulent spirits were kept in check, so that no serious disturbance occurred. The meeting, of course, was enthusiastic. Besides the ""Department"" offices to be filled, there are the following Ward officers to be elected: An Alderman in the even enumerated and an Assessor in the odd enumerated Wards, and a Supervisor and Constable in each Ward. The Democrats are more or less split up in every Ward.

The prospect is solemn, but it does not seriously alarm us, for the experience of London and Paris has proved that the growth, however rapid, of any important suburb, always results in the increased prosperity of the metropolis; and though our contemporary rather cruelly turns Gotham over to the ""excessively wild, extravagant and ambitious,"" and reserves Philadelphia for the decent, orderly, quiet and industrious, we make no doubt that the more people there are in Philadelphia, the more business we shall be doing in New-York.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/04/archives/new-music.html,,"Messrs. WM. HALL SON have just issued, in fine folio style, the complete score for voice and piano of Mr. W.V. WALLACE'S new opera of ""Lurline,"" recently produced in London with unequaled success. Considered simply in its mechanical aspects, the volume is most creditable, and evidences both progress and enterprise in American matters musical. A few years ago the publication of such a work would have been regarded not only as an impossible, but even a ridiculous feat. Now every amateur of pretension prides himself on familiarity with the partitions of new operas. We do not propose to criticize the music of Mr. WALLACE's opera until we are justified in doing so by a dramatic performance of it. Gathering, however, a general idea of the work from the score, we have no hesitation in pronouncing it a remarkable addition to the repertoire of the English stage. The ensembles are numerous, and display rare powers of invention and knowledge of lyric effect. The ballads and sensation pieces are full of telling melodic points, and frequently, very striking in harmonic treatment. In two words, the work is both popular and musicianable, and perused in dry detail, accounts for the extraordinary enthusiasm which prevails in London concerning its merits. There are 32 numbers and 300 pages in the complete edition, which, in every typographical respect, reflects credit on the enterprising house to whom we are indebted for it.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New Music.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New Music.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/929083d3-21d0-548c-9c24-a621649ec55a,235,nyt://article/929083d3-21d0-548c-9c24-a621649ec55a,

At the sale of the contents of a private house in Ninth-street, near Fifth-avenue, yesterday, some rare articles were disposed of. An exquisite piece of statuary, a sleeping infant, in white marble, by POMPOLON, of Florence, which headed the list, was knocked down for $100, to Mr. NIBLO, of Niblo's Garden. The eighth article, as stated in the catalogue, was a ""Louis Philippe Vase, purchased at his auction in Paris."" The purchaser was an elderly Frenchman. The vase is of Dresden China, and the shape and size of a medium punch bowl, and elegantly mounted. It bears the stamp of Sevres, besides the impress of the words ""Palace"" and ""Tuilleries,"" to counterfeit which used to be felony. On one side is a representation of two cupids, holding between them a flower wreath, and beneath a crown, over the initials P.L. The vase has been mended several times. A trousseau box from Florence, said to be 400 years old, brought $65. A carved bedstead, reported of the same age, and taken from an old palace near Lucca, was sold for $60. There were several vases sold which were taken from Pompeii. Some dozen paintings were included in the sale, principally copies of old artists. Among the copies was one of the ""Immaculate Conception,"" by MURILLO; another of the ""Tabernacle,"" by FRA ANGELICO; the ""Virgin of the Harpies,"" ""Achilles Discovered,"" after BATTONI; ""The Deluge,"" by POUSSIN. The paintings commanded good prices.

He urged the proposition upon economical grounds. Without further discussion, the subject was laid aside, and the Homestead debate was resumed. The amendment offered by Hr. FITCH, providing for the retention by Government of alternate quarter sections, was rejected. Mr. BROWN, of Mississippi, referred to a bill he had to offer as a substitute, the distinctive trait of which was to extend the period of preemption, and to prevent the ejection of settlers. For such a measure he declared he should be able to vote; but not for either the Senate or House bill. Mr. GREEN, of Missouri, attacked the whole scheme of free lands or homesteads as mischievous, and as a product of reckless and dangerous partisanship. He added, however, nothing to the arguments previously urged against the measure. Mr. SHERMAN, from the Committee of Ways and Means in the House, reported the Post-office Appropriation bill. Mr. NELSON then resumed and closed his speech in favor of the Utah Polygamy bill, and was followed by Mr. HOOPER, the Mormon delegate, who threatened that the passage of the act would revive the ill-feeling between his people and the Government, which had so lately been extinguished. The substitutes proposed by Messrs. BRANCH and MCCLERNAND were successively put to vote and rejected. The bill finally passed by 149 yeas to 60 nays. Mr. SICKLES, of New-York, claiming to speak to a privileged question, referred to the contest for his seat, and produced and commented upon the notice which Mr. WILLIAMSON, in response to the House resolution, had caused to be served upon him. After some difficulty the Republicans succeeded in silencing him, and in referring the subject to the Committee upon Elections. The Tariff Loan bill was taken up in Committee of the Whole; and Mr. LOVEJOY, of Illinois, made a violently radical speech on the Slavery issue.

The three men crossed Grand-street Ferry, but were soon met by a former keeper on the Island, who recognized De Noir, and suspecting that he had just escaped, followed him through various streets until Officer Gale, of the Fourteenth Ward, was encountered, and the convict's arrest was effected. De Noir protested that he had just been discharged from the Island, and said that his name was Gray.

In the engraving now before us, the dotted upright lines represent the assessed values of the property (real and personal) in the City of New-York for the years at the foot of these lines, (ten years to an inch,) and each inch of the lines themselves stands for two hundred millions of dollars. The zig-zag line which joins the tops of these dotted lines shows our financial Ups and Downs. Thus it is level for the years in which the wealth of the City remained stationary, as from 1815 to 1818, and from 1819 to 1823; the line runs upward when this wealth increased, as from 1831 to 1836; it runs downward when the assessed value decreased, as from 1836 to 1843; and the degree of slope of this line is proportional to the rapidity of this increase or decrease of wealth. The notes inserted at some of the points of change indicate their material causes. They are more fully developed in the following extract from a late message of Gov. STEWART, of Missouri, who used these data as a strong argument for the extension of the railroads of his State.

The Colonel of a celebrated New-York regiment was appointed to the command of the corps, which, it was said, would constitute but a small fraction of the large army already enrolled in various parts of the United States. The Colonel has since declared that he would have nothing to do with the organization, and the few who joined it soon ascertained that the initiation fees and other sums they had paid, were just so much money out of pocket.

"On the 19th ult., Mr. KINGLAKE rose to ask the noble lord the Foreign Secretary a question of which he had privately given notice; but, as he wished to make a short statement to the House, to put himself in order, he would conclude with a motion.

To imagine the magnificent evolution from mist and vapor, from mere inorganic chaos, of a new world, solid and splendid, prolific with life and glorious with light, is to assist in fancy at the most majestic spectacle which it can enter into the mind of man to conceive. And yet, for those who truly measure the worth and dignity of human welfare and of human progress, the political process now going on with such stately and steadfast steps in the Italian Peninsula, must have an interest scarce inferior. There, from the distractions and contradictions of an unnatural and intolerable Past, a great people, the acknowledged peers of the proudest nations of the earth in the grandest attributes of humanity, are now emerging, State by State, and province by province, to gravitate around one common centre into a new national unity and independence. Before the simple fact that, in this sixtieth year of the Nineteenth Century, the world is witnessing the practical realization of a purpose and a hope which have never died out of the brain and heart of Italy throughout all the trials and intrigues and temptations -- all the discouragements and defeats and disappointments of five hundred years -- the merely formal and diplomatic and temporary aspects of what we call the ""Italian Question"" are dwarfed and disappear. The ""treaties of 1815,"" the ""defences of Germany beyond the Alps,"" the ""balance of power in Europe,"" are matters about which the small wise men who rule the world, according to OXENSTIERNA, with so very economical an expenditure of brains, may be allowed to prate in Parliaments and to prose in dispatches. The achievement of Italian independence, like the establishment of the American Republic, or the overthrew of feudalism in France, is an event which can only be justly estimated and fairly comprehended when it is looked at from the foreground of the Future.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Independence of Italy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Independence of Italy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/27d65c2a-8208-51a5-8d40-6853416de88c,2028,nyt://article/27d65c2a-8208-51a5-8d40-6853416de88c,

Mr. TASISTRO began by making a few introductory explanations as to the causes which had induced him to commit to memory some of the most sublime creations of the immortal bard, and then proceeded with the business of the play in a style at once novel and surprising. As his announcement led us to infer, he uses no book or memoranda of any kind, but recites every part from memory with perfect fidelity to the text, modulating his voice, which possesses great flexibility, so as to place each character before the audience in its proper light. These remarkable changes of intonation constituted the distinguishing trait of Mr. TASISTRO's performance throughout, while the great soliloquies were delivered with a degree of pathos and nicety of distinction which are seldom equaled on the stage. The audience was highly delighted, and the applause was loud and spontaneous. That Mr. TASISTRO will make his mark in this new sphere of intellectual exertion, there can be little doubt; and since SHAKESPEARE has been, as it were, banished from the stage by the sensation drama, it is pleasant to witness the success of a gentleman in bringing them, in a still more striking form, before the public.

On Thursday night an open rupture occurred between the frequenters of the salon No. 161 Washington street, kept by one Freidschutz, who, having gone to the place of Martin Butts, corner of Carlisle and West streets, commenced an assault upon its patrons. The fight resulted, however, in no material injury to the combatants, except that Butts, it is said, discharged a pistol at one of the assailants, the ball from which missed its mark and inflicted a slight wound in the leg of his own wife. At a late hour on Friday night, Henry Dedrickson, a Swedish sailor, who is said to have been one of the attacking party on the previous night, was knocked down with either a club or a slung-shot by a member of the antagonistic clique, several of whom were standing at the corner of Carlisle and West streets, as he, partially intoxicated, passed by them on his way to his boarding house, conducted by a sober acquaintance. The outcries of the injured man's companion attracted Officer Ryan to the scene of the assault, but the assailants had secreted themselves before he came up. Dedrickson, who had been rendered insensible by the blow, was removed to the New-York Hospital, where it was found that his skull had been terribly fractured, and the physician pronounced his injuries to be of a fatal character. He still remains at the institution, and has not yet returned to consciousness. A man named John Greenwood was subsequently arrested on suspicion of having been one of Dedrickson's assailants, and after an extended search Sergeant Denton finally apprehended one Jeremiah Murphy at a seaman's boarding house in Oliver-street, who, from the statement of a young man who witnessed the assault, is thought to be the person by whom the murderous blow was struck.

There is a kind of respectable piece a sort of drama of well-dressed but scheming society which can be played at Wallack's Theatre, and nowhere else. It depends on talk without epigram; scenes without situations; is dull, real and uninteresting, but polite and well-bred. With a company remarkable for its knowledge of the nicely toned commonplaces of society, Mr. WALLACK can occasionally play such a piece. At any other house the feat would be dangerous, if not impossible. We are led naturally to these remarks by a consideration of the comedy called ""Leading Strings,"" produced on Saturday night, and which, more than any other recent production, falls short of every ordinary critical excellence. The story is simply that of a step-mother who desires to wean her son from an affection which she conceives to be hasty and ill-founded. She does so, and effects a change in the gentleman's feelings by convincing him that the lady of his choice is a matrimonial schemer. A thread so taut and straight admits of no ingenious entanglement, and hence we look to the dialogue for our immediate sensations of pleasure. We were unable to detect any excellence in this specialty. Mr. TROUGHTON, the author, has failed to say a good thing, and in point of fact, never, from beginning to end, attempts anything higher than a polite platitude. To account for the comparative success which the piece achieved, we must return to the original proposition, that Mr. WALLACK's company can do things which at another house would provoke locked-jaw. Mrs. HOEY, as the step-mother, contrived by some unaccountable means, known only to herself, to make the part not only elegant, but interesting, -- an achievement which we regard as marvelous. Dreary wastes of language bloomed with nice maternal meaning as this sterling actress hovered over them, and mere episodes became domestic epochs by the quiet naturalness of her intensity. Mr. LESTER WALLACE, too, was excellent, not only in a keen perception of the broad weariness of his part, but in the elaboration of innumerable little irritations, without which it would be absolutely nothing. To these two artists belong the success of the piece. Mr. BLAKE -- dressed like a banker -- impersonated a butler, and elicited some welcome merriment by grimacing and wearing his hands constantly in his pockets. For one or both of these achievements he was called out after the piece, and incited to make a little speech. Miss GANNON played with her usual arch vivacity, and was thoroughly good. The subordinate parts were respectably supported, and Mr. LESTER WALLACE announced the comedy for repetition to-night. We do not expect for it a long career.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/737ce593-3221-5ffb-b398-ffcb467feac8,478,nyt://article/737ce593-3221-5ffb-b398-ffcb467feac8,

The news is of interest. The annexation of Tuscany to Sardinia had been consummated, a decree to that effect, accepting the demand of the Etrurians, having been issued by VICTOR EMANUEL. The withdrawal of French troops from Lombardy, having been commenced simultaneously with this action, the Paris Constitutionnel had explained that this course had been pursued through no ill-feeling on the part of France; but because the independence of Italy was thus irrevocably assured. The Sardinian army had at the same moment commenced the evacuation of Savoy. The anticipated French dispatch commenting on the annexation of that province, repudiated the idea of the measure being the inaugural step of a restoration of natural frontiers. The replies of the Great Powers to this statement are reported to have been of one tenor, namely: that they saw no reason to oppose a measure thus stripped of objectionable attributes. The Reform bill and the Budget had been further debated in the British House of Commons. The income tax of ten-pence in the pound had been agreed to. The Reform bill appeared to attract little public attention or interest. Commenting upon the recent speech of Mr. SEWARD in the Senate, the London Times regards its tone as indicative of a better state of feeling between the two sections of the country; and with so modified a programme, it judges it to be possible for the Republicans to withstand the advances of Pro-Slavery aggression.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/10/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Mr. SUMNER, of Massachusetts, moved in the Senate yesterday a resolution calling upon the President for information in regard to the seizure of Mexican vessels in time of peace, and their disposition agreeably to the law of prizes applicable to a state of war. It was adopted. Notice was given by Mr.WILSON, of Massachusetts, of a bill to suppress the Slave-trade. Mr. DAVIS' resolutions were subsequently called up, when Mr. CHESNUT, of South Carolina, argued in support of them, chiefly because they shunned the excess of Congressional intervention in territorial affairs on the one side, and squatter sovereignty on the other. He laid much stress upon the value of the South to the North not only in a political, but conspicuously in a commercial point of view; inferring that in pursuing a policy which was hourly weakening the ties of union, the Republican Party was ruining both sections alike. Mr. CHESNUT spoke at great length, and was listened to with marked attention. At the close of his remarks Mr. HUNTER endeavored to call up the Indian Appropriation bill. Messrs. WADE and JOHNSON (Tenn.) urged the consideration of the House Homestead bill instead; and by a vote of 26 to 22, caused that measure to have precedence of all other bills upon the calendar. Resolutions addressed to the President, inquiring into the state of the Slave-trade, the enforcement of the laws against the traffic, and the propriety of farther preventive legislation, were offered in the House by Mr. MORSE. Mr. BOCOCK and other Southern members proposed amendments tending to fix the responsibility of the trade upon the Northern States; and with them, the resolutions were adopted. Territorial business, at the instance of Mr, GROW, was made the special order for May 2 and 3. Mr. COVODE brought in a report of his Investigating Committee, relative to the recusancy of Mr. AUGUSTUS SCHELL, and called upon the House to take action in the premises. Mr. WINSLOW, of North Carolina, made a minority report, which was decided to be out of order; and the subject was postponed for three weeks. The Special Committee on the President's protest, through Mr. HICKMAN, the Chairman, then reported. The report controverts all the positions assumed by the President; shows how essential the powers claimed by the House are to the exercise of its power of impeachment, of its legislative functions, and for the protection of its privileges; and declares the exemption demanded by Mr. BUCHANAN, for his office, to be dangerous to the rights of a free people. The report concludes by recommending a series of resolutions epitomizing the argument of the Committee. On the part of the minority of the Committee, Mr. HOUSTON announced that they had had no time to prepare a minority report; but that each would present his own views. He proceeded to read a paper setting forth his reasons for dissenting from the majority, the principle point being that if money had been wrongfully used in any State to control elections, it was for that State, and not for the Federal Government, to redress the wrong. Mr. TAYLOR, also of the minority, is to present his views to-day.

No country except our own has presented a fair opportunity of doing this; and it is evident that there can be no better test of the power and value of each element of civilization which enters into the growth of the whole. What we mean by this may be illustrated by some significant examples. Take that of races. The colored race of the United States was, in 1790, 19 per cent. of the whole population; but in 1860 it will be but 13 1/2 per cent. -- showing that it is relatively declining. Again: take States. Virginia had, in 1790, 9 per cent. of the Representatives of the Congress; but in 1860 she will have but 5 per cent. -- having relatively declined nearly one-half. In regard to sections, the Northwestern States had, in 1790, not a single vote; but in 1860 they will have one-fourth of the House of Representatives. This increase has evidently been at the expense of the older States. Let us see, then, how and in what proportion these changes have been effected. We have stated in a former article the probable population of each State, and the representative population. Let us suppose the country to be divided into four sections -- viz.: the old Northern States, the old Southern States, the Northwest and the Southwest.

The association is composed entirely of Germans, and numbers at present about 60 members. The officers are L. FROELICH foreman; JOEEPH STROHMENGER, assistant-foreman and Dr. OTTO, physician. If it should meet with proper encouragement and assistance from the City Government, and from the Insurance Companies, it is proposed to extend the organization into every fire district in the City. The exhibition yesterday was highly successful, and was witnessed by several hundred people,including representatives from various Insurance Companies, City officials and members of the Press. The apparatus employed was similar to that used in European cities, but it is the intention of the Company to avail themselves of every improvement that may be made in fire escapes -- the object of the organization being to get the advantage of skill and practice in their application. This advantage was illustrated by the exhibition yesterday. In the rear of No. 171 Christie-street are two four-story brick buildings which are about to be torn down, and the Company were allowed to experiment on them in any way they pleasad. At the sound of a trumpet from the Foreman, they commenced scaling the walls by means of small ladders, going up one story at a time, and breaking in the windows on their way, until they reached the top of the building. Then, throwing down a rope, they drew up the sack, made it fast, and commenced sliding down in rapid succession, the sack being held at the lower end by their companions, and sufficiently removed from the building to make the descent easy. Trunks, furniture and flour barrels were also rescued through the sack in the same way. This experiment was repeated, and on the second trial not more than two minutes elapsed from the sound of the trumpet before the men were safely sliding down the sack from the fourth-story windows. Experiments were also made with a simpler fire-escape, consisting merely of a sheet of thick canvas, about fifteen feet square, held up by means of ropes passing over the shoulders of men standing on the ground. Between twenty and thirty men, one of them weighing over 200 pounds, jumped from the roof of a four-story building on to this canvas, without sustaining the least injury. The exhibition was concluded by a speech from Mr. HENRY S. SMITH, in which he acknowledged on behalf of the spectators the pleasure they had derived from the spectacle, and awarded due praise to the German population of the City, for being the first to initiate such a praiseworthy organization.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a31f0585-4d76-5e28-ad3d-1c6e6e6efb81,1861,nyt://article/a31f0585-4d76-5e28-ad3d-1c6e6e6efb81,

For some days prior to his decease, in addition to suffering intense physical torture, ROCHELLE betrayed great uneasiness of mind, which at times was of a very agonizing character. Finally, on Thursday last, believing the moment of his dissolution near, he expressed a desire to see Fire Marshal BAKER, to whom he made a confession or his guilt. He stated that three weeks before the fire occurred DEDACE MORRISSETT intimated his intention to burn out the store, because the adjoining crockery establishment of JOSEPH NORTON was doing a more successful business. Afterwards, at MORRISSETT's request, ROCHELLE said that he purchased at different times two gallons of camphene, which were placed in the store. He had been informed by MORRISSETT, on the day the fire occurred, that it was to take place that evening, and consented to assist in the transaction upon the promise of MORRISSETT to start him in a little place for himself, should he be successful in obtaining the insurance money. Accordingly, about 7 1/2 o'clock, on the evening in question, a man whose name ROCHELLE did not know, the brothers MORRISETT and himself, were in the store, and the stranger having applied the match to the pile of inflammable stuff that had been collected, ROCHELLE was directed by DEDACE MORRISETT to throw his overcoat upon the flames. As he was in the act of complying, a glass jar full of camphene, which stood near, was overturned, and some of the liquid saturated his clothing, and fell in his boots, and the flames coming in contact with it, he was instantly set in a blaze. He rushed into the street to save himself, in spite of the opposition of MORRISSETT, who sought, he said, to prevent an exposure by burning him along with the store. White the dying man was making this confession, the brothers MORRISSETT, who have been in custody ever since the occurrence of the fire, stood by his bedside. He accused them of having brought him to his terrible death, and in his frenzy invoked the judgment of heaven upon them. They made no response, and declined to ask him any questions. The only testimony taken at the inquest was as to the manner in which deceased obtained his injuries. A verdict was rendered that he died in consequence of burns received while engaged in the commission of incendiarism. The MORRISETTES' stock, valued at $700, was damaged to the extent of $500, and they had an insurance of $1,000 upon it in the Williamsburgh City Fire Insurance Company. Mr. NORTON, their neighbor, of whose success they were jealous, lost $1,200 worth of property by the fire. It is said that the prisoners owed their landlord nearly $200 for rent, and this is mentioned as an additional incentive to the incendiarism. Yesterday afternoon they were fully committed by Justice CONNOLLY on a charge of arson. In their examination before the magistrate, DEDACE stated that he was a Canadian by birth, 22 years of age, and in reference to the charge against him, he had nothing to say. His brother is also a native of Canada. He protested his innocence.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; SWIFT RETRIBUTION-- CONFESSION AND TERRIBLE DEATH OF AN INCENDIARY.

These men are fit only to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot! They are salt without savor. They have lost function, in losing manhood.

I do not know but what they will save their reputation, but as to saving their souls, I am afraid there is not much to save in that direction! If there is, then there is a doctrine of infinitessimals that is beyond any comprehension of mine. What dastards, what contemptible things wearing the form of men, must they be, who, ou[???]ieing Judas, make haste to sell their principles and their Master, without the pretence of any other temptation than that of saving a little pelf -- and that, too, when they were rich enough to retire long ago!

"Punch represents the youthful King of Naples as playing, in great glee, with the manacles and other instruments of despotism which were the instruments of his father's serious occupation. This young monarch is evidently ambitious of eclipsing the unenviable notoriety which his father acquired by his despotism. At a period when a Murat is plotting for his crown, and the work of Italian independence is carried on so gloriously, it is somewhat hazardous, one would think, for a Sicilian king to test too severely the patience and forbearance of his subjects. Recent outrages, however, against the personal rights and liberties of numerous respectable citizens of Naples prove that FRANCIS II, and his Ministers are of quite a different opinion. A detailed account of these outrages has been communicated to the British Foreign Secretary by Mr. ELLIOT, in a dispatch we have published at length. That document closed, it will be remembered, by stating that his request for an interview with the King, in order that he might warn his Majesty of the fatal consequences of so iniquitous a policy, had been presented to the Minister, and that M.

This young monarch is evidently ambitious of eclipsing the unenviable notoriety which his father acquired by his despotism. At a period when a Murat is plotting for his crown, and the work of Italian independence is carried on so gloriously, it is somewhat hazardous, one would think, for a Sicilian king to test too severely the patience and forbearance of his subjects.

"It appears that Lord BROUGHAM's actual honors in the peerage are not after all to be transmitted to his brother.

"The annual election of Wardens and Vestrymen of Trinity Church took place yesterday. Unusual interest was manifested in this election, in consequence of an independent ticket having been put in the field by the Corporators -- who comprise owners and lessees of pews, and communicants of one year's standing -- in opposition to the regular ticket nominated by the Vestrymen. The precise grounds of this opposition it was difficult to discover at the scene of the election, as each party told a different story, and every man of each party seemed more anxious to secure a vote than to give a reason for the faith that was in him. As near as could be ascertained, however, the parties are at variance on several points. But the origin of the difficulty appears to have been the action of the Rector, Dr. BERRIAN, in appointing to the post of Assistant Rector, Rev. MORGAN L. DIX, a young man who, whatever his merit, which is said to be great, was not entitled, in the opinion of many of the corporators, to be thus promoted over the heads of his seniors. Mr. DIX is the son of Hon. JOHN A. DIX, Ex-Senator of New-York, who is one of the present Vestrymen, but whose name was omitted from the opposition ticket. Another ground of opposition was stated to be a proposed change in the policy of the Church, advocated by several of last year's Vestrymen, by which the stipends heretofore granted to poor Churches and the annuities awarded to the families of deceased clergymen, were to be cut off I was also argued that the practice which has heretofore prevailed, of allowing the Vestrymen to nominated their successors, while the Corporators contented themselves with merely indorsing, by their votes, the ticket thus nominated, should be broken up. These reasons, together with others, evidently of a personal nature, combined to make the election a very execiting one, and gave the vestibule of Trinity Church the apperance of a more wo[???]ly polling place. At the closing of the, polls it was announced that the whole number of votes polled was 210, nearly 100 more than were ever cast before. On canvassing the votes, it was found that the regular, or Vestrymen's ticket, was elected by about 180 majority, or nearly four to one Most of the names on the opposition ticket, however, were the same as those on the regular ticket, -- the only exceptions being, that on the opposition ticket the name of ANTHONY J.

"We have received a long statement from a committee of the stone-cutters on the new Cathedral, giving the reasons for their refusing to go on with their work under the contractor. Two dollars a day, hey say, is the standard price during winter for their work; yet many of the best workmen among them could not earn over nine shilligs. A committee accordingly waited upon Mr. JOYCE, the contractor, to ask an increase of wages. He replied that he made his own regulations and paid his own prices, and those who did not like them could leave. They accordingly withdrew on the 14th of February, and although five committees have since waited upon Mr. JOYCE, they have been able to make no arrangement with him. The Committee state that they ask nothing unreasonable, but merely fair wages for their work. They refer to Archbishop HUGHES' statement on laying the corner-stone of the building, that its erection would give employment to the poor at fair compensation, which has not been fulfilled. They deny that they have ever used or threatened personal violence to any parties on account of this strike, and declare that they have no sympathy with any such demonstrations.

Two dollars a day, hey say, is the standard price during winter for their work; yet many of the best workmen among them could not earn over nine shilligs. A committee accordingly waited upon Mr. JOYCE, the contractor, to ask an increase of wages. He replied that he made his own regulations and paid his own prices, and those who did not like them could leave. They accordingly withdrew on the 14th of February, and although five committees have since waited upon Mr. JOYCE, they have been able to make no arrangement with him. The Committee state that they ask nothing unreasonable, but merely fair wages for their work. They refer to Archbishop HUGHES' statement on laying the corner-stone of the building, that its erection would give employment to the poor at fair compensation, which has not been fulfilled. They deny that they have ever used or threatened personal violence to any parties on account of this strike, and declare that they have no sympathy with any such demonstrations.

The reception was deserved, for of the many directors we have had in this City and their numbers have been sufficient to throw discredit on their ability he is undoubtedly the one to whom the ""divine art"" is most indebted for past services and present advancement. We say this with no desire to underrate the oftentimes meritorious efforts of others who have followed in his footsteps, but simply as a matter of truth which may gracefully be put on record at this moment. Something is due to the hardy pioneer who treads the path to progress and success, and this something is Mr. MARETREK's, as a glance at the record will prove. Much has been accomplished since the memorable epoch of the old Astor-place Opera-house. Italian opera has been established ""on a permanent basis"" at least a dozen times, and, whether successfully or not, we have secured by the efforts then iniatiated a succession of respectable operas and artists. The usual contests incidental to an enterprise promising great results have taken place over and over again; lessees have quarrelled with managers, managers with artists, artists with the public, and so on to the end of the chapter. No one save the parties pecuniarily interested have regretted these little episodes, for they have been the means of exciting a spirit of excellence and of educating the public in the school of comparison, which would not otherwise have been expected or effected. When the Academy of Music was erected, it was supposed that these old struggles would cease, and that, content with one spacious opera house, the Musical World would rest satisfied with what the managers chose to give them. Under ordinary circumstances this might have been regarded as a natural consequence of a wise and liberal speculation, but an injudicious system of leasing the Fourteenth-street house for a lengthy period, and of thus establishing, or attempting to establish a monopoly of Italian opera, has resulted -- as all such efforts result -- in a long series of oppositions. For the simple reason that the Winter Garden possesses better acoustic properties than any other establishment in the City, it has been invariably selected as the battle ground for the musical contestants. Besides many others, Mr. HACKETT, (with GRISI and MARIO,) Mr. STRAKOSCH, and finally Mr. MARETZEK, have in turn occupied it with their belligerent forces, -- numbering frequently some of the greatest and best artists we have ever had in this country. So much for the place and the cause of its selection. Mr. MARETZEK, like a cautious general, enters upon his present fight with ample resources. His company is unusually strong -- the strongest, probably, that has been in this City since the palmy days of the Marti troupe. Among his prime donne we find the names of Mesdames INEZ FABBRI, GASSIER, FREZZOLINI and WISSLER; his principal tenors are Signors ERRANI and STIGELLI; his baritones and bassos, Messrs. GASSIER, GASPARONI, ARDAVANI and MULLER. With this double force in all departments he is able to play six times a week, and will of course do so.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Winter Garden Italian Opera.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Winter Garden Italian Opera.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Music', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-04-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2ab6f79-6e1b-540a-a501-e40f00c55b59,952,nyt://article/d2ab6f79-6e1b-540a-a501-e40f00c55b59,

"In the House of Commons, on the 26th ult., Mr. HORSMAN took an opportunity of referring to the subject of foreign policy, and especially with regard to the rights of the House to discuss questions connected with our foreign relations. When Parliament met there were numerous questions on foreign affairs on which no obstruction had been offered to the Government. There had been matters of controversy between the Governments of France and England on the subjects of the Suez Canal and the war between Spain and Morocco, but no information had been given to the House on the subject -- none had been given with regard to differences which had existed on the subject of the joint expedition to China. Turning to Savoy he said that at the end of last session assurances were given that the Emperor had no intention of territorial aggrandisement. At the beginning of this session the House was told that the Government had no official information of any step towards annexation on the part of France. That answer had been from time to time repeated, in spite of the assertions by Mr. KINGLAKE and Sir ROBERT PEEL that they had received information that the annexation of Savoy was complete, and without any consultation of the Powers of Europe. At length the Government admitted that a dispatch had been received showing that Savoy had been annexed, and without any consultation with the Powers of Europe. The answer of the Foreign Secretary to that dispatch had been forwarded by Lord JOHN RUSSELL, but it was still withheld, thus showing that the spirit of the noble lord was not that which dictated the foreign policy of the Government. It was stated in the French journals that that answer was a protest couched in the most friendly terms. It was evidently kept back from a fear of hostile criticism. It was stated that the proceedings of France had been precipitated by the discussions in the House of Commons. No doubt that was the case, because a hostile motion in that house would cause embarrassment, and take the matter out of the hands of a docile Government. At the moment that the Government thought it was negotiating, acts were doing which ended in the accomplishment of the annexation of Savoy, offering a strong contrast to the prescience of Mr. KINGLAKE, which entitled him to the confidence of the House, and it behaved them for the future to watch the Government, who were no match for the duplicity of their Imperial ally. He protested against the interference with the rights of the House involved in the doctrine which had been laid down, that members were to frame their speeches in consonance with the wishes of the Emperor of the French. It was in vindication of his right as a member of that House that he declared the policy of the Emperor in Italy, in Savoy, and Switzerland, was one of deceit, perfidy and injustice, while he made mere tools of the ministers of England. If he was to be rebuked for the expressions from the Treasury bench, he would retort that he saw there many who had fallen under the censure of the House, and he would warn those who wished to fetter a speech in that House to take care that they did not again incur a severe censure.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/13/archives/the-annexation-of-savoy-important-speech-of-lord-john-russell-the.html,,"In the House of Commons, on the 26th ult., Mr. HORSMAN took an opportunity of referring to the subject of foreign policy, and especially with regard to the rights of the House to discuss questions connected with our foreign relations.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/13/archives/african-civilization-mass-meeting-and-exciting-times-in-zion-church.html,,"For several months past, a feeling of strong opposition has been gaining ground among the colored people against the ""African Civilization"" movement, that Society being regarded as a revival, under another name, and with more specious and deceptive appearances, of their ancient enemy, the American Colonization Society. The recent large meeting at Cooper Institute, with influential ministers in attendance to promote its objects, appears to have finally aroused this sentiment into action, and a counter movement was commenced by Mr. GEORGE DOWNING, Rev. Dr. PENNINGTON and others, to awaken the fears of the colored people as to the dangerous trap into which they were being conducted, principally under the leadership of Rev. H.H. GARNETT. Everything being in readiness for making a telling protest against this new scheme, a meeting was called at Zion Church last evening, and the house was crowded at an early hour. Both parties were strongly represented, and, as the sequel proved, were so equally balanced in numbers, and withal so excited upon the subject of their differences, that neither deliberation nor agreement were possible. Mr. GARNETT was warmly cheered on entering the house with Rev. Mr. MARTIN from Boston. It was some time before the semblance of an organization could be secured, an attempt being made by Mr. DOWNING to carry with the election of officers a general programme for the government of the speakers. This was resisted by Mr. GARNETT, and produced a long and wordy dispute, in which every person present appeared to have his say. Mr. WM.A. TYSON was finally elected to preside, and a number of letters were read from different parts of the country, among which was one from GERRIT SMITH, strongly condemning the African Civilization movement as a revival of their old proscriptive enemy the Colonization Society. A series of resolutions was next read, denouncing and condemning the Society in the strongest terms. Every stage of the proceedings was interrupted by cries, hisses, stamping and other noisy and violent demonstrations, growing out of the efforts, first of DOWNING and then of GARNETT, to obtain a hearing. In the midst of this scene of confusion, which at one time nearly brought the opposing parties into violent conflict, the reporters retreated to the pulpit, and surveyed the scene from that safe and advantageous point. Finding that nothing could be done, Rev. Mr. GRAY, the Pastor, declared the meeting adjourned, and the lights were turned off. The meeting, from beginning to end, was the best possible demonstration of the need of ""African Civilization"" in New-York.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'African Civilization.; MASS MEETING AND EXCITING TIMES IN ZION CHURCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'African Civilization.; MASS MEETING AND EXCITING TIMES IN ZION CHURCH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8cd3c900-414e-501a-8108-70f4ac93bb1b,422,nyt://article/8cd3c900-414e-501a-8108-70f4ac93bb1b,

This protest, of course, was at once caught up eagerly by the Opposition members of the English Parliament as a fresh and promising weapon of assault upon the Palmerston Ministry over the shoulders of the Emperor of the French; and we publish to-day the sum of an animated debate which took place in the House of Commons on the 26th of March upon the course of the Government in relation as well to the general recent policy of France, as to this particular act, by which the liberties of Helvetia were charged to have been put in imminent peril. The attack was led, not by any regular captain of the Tory line, but by one of the most calculating of condottieri, Mr. HORSMAN, a Liberal by profession, but by position a mal-content, and who seems to be aiming at securing for himself the same sort of anomalous authority with the Conservatives which Mr. GLADSTONE's eccentric independence has acquired for that illustrious Tory with the Liberals. A glance at Mr. HORSMAN's speech will satisfy any reader unhappily versed in the ways of the political world of its thoroughly partisan tone and purport. It was less Mr. HORSMAN's hope to prove that the French Emperor had been ""deceitful, perfidious, and unjust,"" than to brand the Palmerston Ministry as ""Imperial tools.""

The fire burnt for three weeks, and same of the coal depots are not yet entirely consumed. There are now in Bridgetown two large spaces, known as ""Burnt Districts."" The one on the leeward side of the town, of some fifteen years' standing, was purchased by Government for public buildings; but it seems that these edifices will now be erected on the newly-burnt district. It is an ill wind that brings no one any good, and the fires of Bridgetown will be the means of making it a more imposing city than it ever was before -- worthy its position as the capital of the most nourishing West India Dependency or the British Crown.

The strictly British journalist is never weary of proclaiming the immaculate veracity and the adamantine integrity of the race to which he belongs.

And when the shadow of the great French Empire broadens sadly on his mind, the British scribe turns to these inalienable prerogatives as his only consolation, in the presence of a phenomenon which he can neither tolerate nor abolish. It is truly a satisfaction to him to think that if France is hourly gaining new power in the councils of Europe, and the French Emperor daily opening new pathways of prosperity to his people, England is still the only country which has never broken its faith, and Englishmen are still the only mortals upon whom Astraea can look down with longing recognition from her chill exile in the clouds.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and Her Evil Genius.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and Her Evil Genius.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/112ff8b0-fd85-5f01-9143-2a1958fb10a1,672,nyt://article/112ff8b0-fd85-5f01-9143-2a1958fb10a1,

COMSTOCK, left her dock at the foot of Canalist., at noon on Saturday, for Southampton and Havre, with 197 passengers, and $605,000 in specie. A large crowd assembled on the pier, and awaited the final signal for sailing with the most impatient interest. The decks of the steamers Atlantic and Baltic, the bridge-way surrounding the pier, and even the top of the sheds were black with eager spectators, many evidently having come to take leave of friends, but the larger portion no doubt attracted by their interest in the noble steamer, and by sympathy with the new career upon which she has entered. She wore the French tri-color at the fore, the private -- old Collins line -- signal at the main, and the American ensign at the mizzen. As she moved away from the pier cheers were given by the crowd, and responded to from on board the steamer, accompanied with the waving of handkerchiefs. Three rousing cheers and a tiger were given for Capt. COMSTOCK. A salute was fired from the end of the pier. DODWORTH's Band, which had assembled to play a parting serenade to Mr. D.R. SANFORD, gave several lively airs, not forgetting the tribute of the ""Marsellaise"" to the French tricolor, ""Old Lang Syne"" for their friend, and ""Hail Columbia"" as a finale. The crowd lingered upon the pier until the steamer was nearly out of view. The steamer Bavaria, which sailed at the same hour for Hamburg, took out 185 passengers; and the Kangaroo, which left for Liverpool, 185 passengers. Among the passengers who sailed were: Rev. Dr. MURRAY, of Elizabeth, N.J.; Rev. Dr. SEYBURN, of Philadelphia; Rev. Dr. JAMES DEMAREST, of Lowell; Rev. Dr. SCOTT and Rev. Dr. SPIER, of Brooklyn. They intend to make a tour through Switzerland and Southern Europe.

The Governor sent into the Assembly his veto of the bills, taking the ground that the valuable franchises conferred by the bills should be made profitable to the City, and a suitable amount should be paid into the City Treasury, to aid the tax-payers in return for such franchise; if not, at least the fare should have been so restricted as to insure protection to the masses who use the roads. Another objection is the perpetuation of the franchises which give away the franchises forever, and without the power reserved to the Legislature to revoke or amend them. Other objections were urged, such as the utter want of responsibility attached to the corporations; the absence of restrictions as to the time of the completion, or to prevent them from breaking up roads into parcels and charging fare on each section. The Governor admits the necessity of railroad facilities for the city, but thinks the privileges granted are too sweeping in their character to warrant his signature to the bills. The veto was laid on the table, and at the evening session was taken up and read. Mr. JAQUES, of this City, made a speech in support of the veto; after which a vote was taken, and the bills passed 82 to 25. Their passage through the Senate is confidently anticipated. The bills confirming the Ninth-avenue grant, mitigating capital punishment, and the Anti-Rent bill, obtained the Governor's signature. The usual votes of thanks to its officers were unanimously accorded by the Senate. The Railroad Toll bill, non-concurred in by the Assembly, had been the subject of further conference, at which the two Committees failed to agree. The Senate voted to adhere to its amendments, thus killing the measure for the present session.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d287bccd-2472-5ae5-b45b-347dbcfcf4e8,1701,nyt://article/d287bccd-2472-5ae5-b45b-347dbcfcf4e8,

Boxes, bags, and a great variety of parcels, were sold at prices ranging from 50 cents to $22, and the purchasers remained in hope and fear, in relation to the value of these bargains, until 4 P.M., when the sale closed for the day, and the packages were delivered. The delivery created great excitement. As soon as a buyer received his parcel, he was surrounded by some hundred persons, all in the best of humor, who cried loudly for the opening of the package. If the purchaser showed the least inclination to comply, he was hustled incontinently to the front of the room, and every assistance freely rendered. A number of packages were thus opened, and whenever one proved to be of less value than its purchaser had fondly hoped for, the owner came in for a storm of jokes and mock sympathy, which, however they may have effected the speculator, created unbounded mirth among the bystanders. A lucky purchaser was suffered to take away his prize without remark, out if any selfish man ran away with his package to enjoy the opening of it privately, he was sure to be followed by groans, and requests that he would publish the contents of his parcel in Vanity Fair.

The case of ELECTA THOMPSON and her husband, JOHN THOMPSON, against the Hudson River Railroad Company, to recover damages for injuries sustained by Mrs. THOMPSON on that road on the 18th of January last, was brought to trial yesterday in the Circuit Court before Judge LOTT and a Jury. The facts as briefly stated in the complaint are, that on the 18th day of January last Mrs. THOMPSON purchased a ticket of defendants at Poughkeepsie for New-York. The train was stopped between Sing Sing and Tarrytown, to make some repairs, and while at this point was run into by another train, going in the same direction. In this collision Mrs. THOMAS W. FIRLD, of Brooklyn, married that morning, was killed, and several others were seriously injured. Among the latter was the plaintiff in this suit, who had her collar bone broken and fractured in different places, the bones of one leg below the knee and the ankle were broken, and she was otherwise bruised and injured. The defence acknowledged carelessness on the part of the conductor of the train, and consequently the case was much simplified. After examining witnesses to show the circumstances attending the accident, Dr. ISAACS, Dr. MASON and several other medical gentlemen were examined as to the character and extent of the injuries sustained by plaintiff. They were of opinion that she would not be able to walk without a crutch for three years or more, and that her shoulder would not be in a condition so that she could use a crutch for several months. The case was summed up for the defendants by T.M. NORTH, and for the plaintiff, by MITOHELL SANFORD. After a brief charge from the Court, the jury retired, with directions to bring in a sealed verdict this morning The first ballot stood: Five for $8,000, fire for $7,000, one for $7,500 and one for $9,000: and it is understood that they finally agreed upon $7,000 for plaintiff.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/54b4224d-b31d-50d2-97b1-ef122e1aaebf,388,nyt://article/54b4224d-b31d-50d2-97b1-ef122e1aaebf,

This sale was continued and closed yesterday, having afforded for two days a fund of amusement to hundreds who, having nothing of present importance to engage their attention, were glad to while away their time in watching the ""fools who came there for bargains."" The crowd was doubtless much increased by the announcement that one patty, who had purchased a sailor's chest for $6, found in it nearly $200 in gold, and one consequence was, that any bag, box or chest which had the aroma of far about it was eagerly sought for, and bid in at fabulous prices. Another party who had purchased a box for $5, sold his purchase within fire minutes for $100, as it turned out that he had secured a box of shell combs. These facts gave a spirit of animation to yesterday's biddings, but we were not informed of any more such fortunate speculations. One party, we chance to know, invested $12 in various unseen packages, the sum total of which, when exposed to view, disclosed one pair of very dilapidated pants; one pair shoes, do.; one pair cotton drawers; one red flannel shirt, which had evidently done faithful service to some Marblehead fisherman; one dozen bottles syrup, of yellow dock, and one dozen bottles of bitters. The fortunate purchaser, considering that he had been well bitten, transferred his claims to a venerable darkey, who appeared to be an active member of the firm, and consoled himself with the reflection that he might have lost more, if he had bidden for more. The sale, which has been conducted by Messrs.

They have 700 members and flourishing Sabbath and industrial schools. The colored Church in Seventh-avenue, of which Mr. WILSON is pastor, is flourishing. Twelve members were added last year on profession of faith. The Sabbath School has 65 children. The Third Presbyterian Church of Jersey City is doing well: has purchased the church edifice of the Reformed Dutch Church. The Staten Island Church is in a flourishing state, and the meetings are well attended. The members have contributed from $2,400 to $2,500 last year -- defraying all expenses of the Church.

"The Legislature has been guilty of a great oversight in not depriving the Governor of the pardoning power, in the cases defined by the act abolishing capital punishment as ""murder in the first degree."" As we have already said in discussing this subject, the great merit of capital punishment, if it have any merit at all, lies in the fact that once inflicted it cannot be undone. It is this incident which gives it most of its terrors in the eyes of evil doers, and consequently makes it most valuable in the repression of crime. If it were possible, however, to substitute a punishment which, while as certainly cutting off the culprit from all that makes life dear, would still leave him the possibility of proving his innocence in case he were unjustly condemned, and thus remove all hesitation on the part of jurors about handing a criminal over to his fate, on having a fair case made out against him -- justice would unquestionably be a great gainer, and society, we believe, would lose nothing by the change. In other words, if every man who meditates a murder were as certain, that if convicted of the crime, and sentenced to imprisonment and hard labor, for life, he would sever regain his liberty unless he could subsequently prove his innocence, as that if he were once hanged he would never come to life, we believe the community would, on the whole, gain by the abolition of the gallows. But, unfortunately, no such result as this can ever be brought about. As long as there is life, there will always be hope. There is always the chance of escape in some way or other. Walls are but stone, jailors are but men, and liberty is a great prize; and from these drawbacks to its efficiency imprisonment can never be freed, by any amount of legislation.

Water-street, occupied by EPHRAIM TREADWELL a cracker and ship-bread bakery. The firemen quickly responded to the alarm, but their exertions were ineffectual to subdue the fire, which the light wood-work in the interior of the building served to feed, and in a very brief space of time the whole edifice was wrapped in flames. The neighborhood is densely populated, chiefly by sailors and the inmates of low groggeries, all of whom were thrown into the wildest consternation by the occurrence, and at once commenced the removal of their effects. Soon the rear wall of the building fell upon the roof of the coppersmith-shop and bell-foundry adjoining, No. 265 Water-street, occupied by E. DUSENBERRY, crushing it in and involving a damage of several hundred dollars to the building. A number of firemen, in their eagerness to be of service, rushed into No. 269 Water-street, the oil-clothing manufactory of W.A. HILT, and threw about $500 worth of goods into the street, while the contents of another store, occupied as a tailoring establishment by the same individual, were somewhat damaged. Mr. HILT is insured for $10,000 upon stock, in the National and People's Insurance Company. The loss that Mr. TREADWELL has suffered is estimated at between $50,000 and $60,000. He is probably insured for nearly the full amount, although it was impossible to ascertain the full particulars, or the names of the companies. This same bakery was destroyed by the same fire that consumed the ships Great Republic and Joseph Waller, in 1836. Two steam fire-engines were at work on the burning building, and did good service, though the supply of water from the hydrants was inadequate for both of them, and one had to obtain water from the river.

S. Consul at Havana, by the steamer Empire City, charged with the murder of John A. Peterson, second mate of the bark, while lying in the harbor of Havana. The accused was brought before the Commissioner for examination yesterday. Frank Morris, the first mate of the bark, who was sent home as a witness, testified that on the 6th of March the second mate and the prisoner had an altercation, in which hard words were passed; that the second mate picked up a serving mallet and raised it, as if to strike the prisoner, when the first mate said ""Don't strike,"" and raised his arm, receiving the blow on his arm, and the mallet fell on deck. The two men then clinched, and after a moment's struggle the second mate pushed the prisoner from him, and cried out ""I am stabbed;"" he then ran aft a short distance, fell upon the deck and expired without a struggle; while witness was looking to see if the prisoner had a knife, he suddenly turned upon him and gave him a severe stab in the left side. He was only able to give the order to have the prisoner put in irons when he was carried below in a fainting condition. The wound was severe, and laid him up in the hospital over two weeks, during which he was not expected to live. One other witness was examined, who substantially corroborated the foregoing statement of the first mate, and also stated that there was a severe cut over the right eye of the prisoner, from which the blood was flowing profusely; how or by whom the blow was given he could, not state. The accused was fully committed on the charge of murder.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LAW INTELLIGENCE.; Murder on Ship-board. U.S. COMMISSIONER'S COURT BEFORE G.F.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/19/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The Arago, with dates from Southampton to April 4, arrived here last evening. Her news is of less than usual interest. A Congress of the Great Powers upon the questions of Italy and Savoy is now said to be determined upon. The Swiss Government had addressed a fresh protest to the French Foreign-office, against the transfer of Faucigny and Chablais. In the meantime, French troops had occupied Nice and Savoy. At the opening of the Sardinian Chambers, King VICTOR EMANUEL had made the customary speech, reviewing the condition of the kingdom. The progress of Italian unity was made the especial topic of felicitation. It is understood that the King of Naples has abandoned the idea of throwing troops into the Papal States. Austria has at last protested in form against the annexation of Savoy by France, and of Central Italy by Piedmont. She regards both as substantial violations of the conditions of Villafranca. From Spain we learn that a movement in favor of Don CARLOS had been inaugurated by Gen. ORTEGA, at the head of 3,000 men. His troops had not been attacked by Government forces. General discontent prevailed in Spain among all classes, in regard to the Moorish treaty. It was understood that the O'Donnell Cabinet would be obliged to resign immediately. The English Parliament had adjourned to April 16. Warrants for the arrest of SAYERS and HEENAN had been issued by the authorities of Hertfordshire, who were resolute to prevent the great prize fight taking place within the limits of that county.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cdf7147d-6b54-5e75-9148-89951d998158,1857,nyt://article/cdf7147d-6b54-5e75-9148-89951d998158,

The writer is commenting upon a duel at St. Petersburg, in which an artillery officer has been sorely wounded by a pistol-shot, and he proceeds: ""I think the pistol adds greatly to the odiousness of the duel. Firearms lame and disfigure you when they do not kill you. The cold steel kills, too, but if it wounds it does not spoil you.

(This, considering its ""present position,"" sounds somewhat ironical.) He says that the K.G.C. was intended to embrace only gentlemen of character and respectability, but that in the establishment of the New-Orleans branch it was rather unfortunate, and gathered in rowdies, gamblers, and other disreputable elements. In regard to the ""assets,"" &c., Sir CHARLES intimates that as the Order has none, the appointment of a receiver was useless. He says that Gen. BICKLEY will take no notice of his expulsion; that he has already issued a call for a Convention at Raleigh, N.C.; that steps will be taken to purge the order of all unworthy members; and that hereafter it will only consist of ""Southern gentlemen, by birth, education and practice -- men capable of building up a high grade of civilization in the country towards which their energies a re directed."" Really, according to Sir CHARLES BICKLEY's showing, the K.G.C. is quite as worthy an organization as the Tract Society, and will quite supersede the Board of Foreign Missions.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/20/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- An audience of nearly a thousand persons, comprising the elite of the musical public of New-York, assembled by invitation at the Academy yesterday morning to witness what we may call the tentative debut of a young lady of this City, who has been devoting the last three years to preparation for the career of a lyric artist. This lady, Miss LOUISA KELLOGG, is still in the very budding prime of youth; far too young to commence in earnest a life so arduous and exacting as that of a prima donna must be for a singer who possesses her really remarkable qualities of intellect and of voice. Her appearance of yesterday, therefore, we hope, is only to be regarded as a brilliant point reached in her studies, and not as her definitive entrance upon her profession. Judged in this light, Miss KELLOGG's execution of the striking and difficult role selected for her in ""Il Poliuto"" must be chronicled as the most interesting musical event of the current season. In point of force and of quality, this young lady's voice leaves nothing to be desired which time and simple physical development may not be reasonably expected to bring to her. In the upper register it is singularly fresh, vigorous and expressive; and it possesses, beyond a question, that rarest and most precious of vocal qualities, a musical magnetism of tone pliant to the will of the singer, and carrying the sentiment of her song directly to the musical consciousness of the hearer. Under all the disadvantages of a rehearsal out of costume, Miss KELLOGG made this gift of hers ""tell"" with emphatic effect, in the brilliant cavatina of the first act, and in her duo with BRIGNOLI. How difficult it is for n inexperienced singer to do this, when tenor and baritone and chorus alike stalk unconcernedly about the stage in the round hat and pantaloons of common Broadway life, and a dim twilight of mingling day and gas robs the house of its stimulating splendor, we need not say. For a debutante to achieve so positive an effect upon her first appearance before a great audience, and thrown almost entirely upon her own resources by the utter absence of any attempt at dramatic action on the part of the company, was certainly little less than amazing.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Music', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-04-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8dae4344-6139-5205-92ef-9f37bd26c1de,1447,nyt://article/8dae4344-6139-5205-92ef-9f37bd26c1de,

"The Senate Committee, appointed to investigate rumored abuses of the public printing, made its report yesterday. The evidence, which embraces testimony from CORNELIUS WENDELL, Collector BAKER, of Philadelphia, RICE, formerly of the Pennsylvanian, Col. FLORENCE, and others, places beyond question the fact of the extensive profit and patronage of the printing having been employed, under the direction of the President, to reward his partisan friends, and to influence elections. The subject is shown to have been a favorite one with Mr. BUCHANAN, and his devotion to it to have been incessant and indefatigable. Two thousand extra copies of the report were ordered to be printed. The House bill in regard to the census was passed. Mr. BAYARD, from the Judiciary Committee, reported a bill relative to private property taken for public uses, and prescribing the mode of valuation and compensation. After a debate in which Messrs. MASON, WIGFALL and COLLAMER participated, the bill was set aside, and the Homestead bill taken up. Mr. GWIN modified his amendment respecting the occupancy of mineral lands, by excluding foreigners who have merely declared their intentions from the advantages of the Act. Mr. LANE, of Oregon, and Mr. BRAGG, of North Carolina, opposed this modification; and it was rejected. Mr. FITCH offered an amendment, which was rejected, permitting all soldiers who had been in actual service to locate a quarter section. Mr. CRITTENDEN Proposed and argued at length for an amendment restricting the benefits of the bill to persons actually resident in the country at the passage of the act. The amendment was opposed by Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas, and was unsuccessful. The subject was finally made the order for May 2, when it is understood the vote shall be taken, and the Senate went into Executive session. The House of Representatives, in Committee of the Whole, discussed the Senate amendment to the Military Academy bill, whereby some 800,000 are appropriated to raise and equip a regiment of mounted volunteers in Texas. Messrs. REAGAN, PENDLETON, and MCRAE successively spoke in favor of the regiment, while Messrs. STEVENS and STAUNTON opposed it: the latter proposing an amendment, which failed, authorizing the President to employ the same money to mount any infantry regiment of the regular army, and detail it to the Indian service. Mr. OTERO, the delegate from New-Mexico, moved for a similar appropriation for his Territory. A vote was at length obtained upon the Senate's amendment, when it was lost, 50 to 69, and the Committee rose.

The subject is shown to have been a favorite one with Mr. BUCHANAN, and his devotion to it to have been incessant and indefatigable. Two thousand extra copies of the report were ordered to be printed. The House bill in regard to the census was passed. Mr. BAYARD, from the Judiciary Committee, reported a bill relative to private property taken for public uses, and prescribing the mode of valuation and compensation. After a debate in which Messrs. MASON, WIGFALL and COLLAMER participated, the bill was set aside, and the Homestead bill taken up. Mr. GWIN modified his amendment respecting the occupancy of mineral lands, by excluding foreigners who have merely declared their intentions from the advantages of the Act. Mr. LANE, of Oregon, and Mr. BRAGG, of North Carolina, opposed this modification; and it was rejected. Mr. FITCH offered an amendment, which was rejected, permitting all soldiers who had been in actual service to locate a quarter section. Mr. CRITTENDEN Proposed and argued at length for an amendment restricting the benefits of the bill to persons actually resident in the country at the passage of the act. The amendment was opposed by Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas, and was unsuccessful. The subject was finally made the order for May 2, when it is understood the vote shall be taken, and the Senate went into Executive session. The House of Representatives, in Committee of the Whole, discussed the Senate amendment to the Military Academy bill, whereby some 800,000 are appropriated to raise and equip a regiment of mounted volunteers in Texas. Messrs. REAGAN, PENDLETON, and MCRAE successively spoke in favor of the regiment, while Messrs. STEVENS and STAUNTON opposed it: the latter proposing an amendment, which failed, authorizing the President to employ the same money to mount any infantry regiment of the regular army, and detail it to the Indian service. Mr. OTERO, the delegate from New-Mexico, moved for a similar appropriation for his Territory. A vote was at length obtained upon the Senate's amendment, when it was lost, 50 to 69, and the Committee rose. The House then accepted the Senate's amendment by a close vote, and adjourned.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a087b82a-1838-5279-859d-67006ce682f9,1297,nyt://article/a087b82a-1838-5279-859d-67006ce682f9,

"Prof. WISE, Sen., the veteran aeronaut, made a successful ascension, in his new balloon Ganymede, yesterday afternoon, from Palace Garden. The announcement drew a large crowd of the curious to the vicinity, a majority of whom, as usual, availed themselves of the neighboring roofs and upper windows, to enjoy the spectacle gratis. The balloon, which is the smallest the Professor has ever used, is 27 by 29 feet in diameter, and bears the inscription Ganymede, with the mottos ""Extra Flammantia,"" ""Menia Mundi,"" on its sides, the name being in large letters. It is not quite half as large as his balloon Jupiter, and contains, when fully inflated, about 10,000 cubic feet of gas. It is made of light cambric linen, and is coated with a varnish of the Professor's own invention. It is only capable, when inflated with common gas, of sustaining one person, besides the necessary ballast, while, with pure hydrogen gas, it would easily support two persons of the Professor's weight. The basket was a neat one, made of the usual material, about 3 1/2 by 2 1/2 feet square, and 20 inches deep. A grappling of some 15 pounds was deposited in the bottom of the basket, to which was securely attached the end of a small line, some ten fathoms in length, of three strands, and made of linen thread, very strong and pliable. The netting was of strong cotton twine of a small size, the basket ropes attached to the circular hoop being of hemp, about the size of an ordinary clothes-line. The balloon was placed upon a raised platform in the middle of the open space, and the process of inflation commenced at twenty minutes before three P.M., the gas being conducted from the main in the street through a varnished cloth hose, six inches in diameter.

At 4 o'clock the Professor, seeing that the audience was still small, but that the quarters were gradually coming in, asked for fifteen or twenty minutes' delay, which was unanimously granted. At 4 1/2 o'clock the order for unloosing the cords from the sand bags was given; three of the smaller sacks were deposited in the basket as ballast, and an extra coat as protection against the cold. The Professor himself then stepped in, holding in his hands two miniature flags. At 4 3/4 P.M., the wind having slightly lulled, the only rope which held the balloon was severed by the Professor's knife, and the Ganymede rose slowly but majestically into space, amid the cheers of the multitude. Prof. WISE now mounted the sides of the basket, holding by the hoop, and waved his little flags, the crowd from below and from the house-tops cheering vociferously. In a moment more the balloon rose above the houses, and was caught by the fresh southeast wind, which carried it rapidly toward the northwest. At the altitude of about half a mile it took a southerly current, and, on going half a mile higher, during which the aeronaut was seen to discharge considerable ballast, he struck a current which carried him slowly toward the East River.

"PROBABLE MURDER BY BURGLARS -- ARREST OF SUSPECTED PARTIES. -- At about 3 o'clock Thursday morning, two burglars entered the house of Dr. NELSON A. GARBISON, on the Jamaica Plank Road. OWEN COX, a man in the employ of Dr. G., heard the burglars at work in the second story of the house, and stationed himself at the foot of the stairway with a spear, and when they were leaving he attempted to stop them and called for Dr. GARRISON, who was also in the house. Finding their chance of escape doubtful, one of the burglars discharged a pistol at COX, the bullet from which entered the left side near the heart, inflicting, it is supposed, a mortal wound.

"It is remarked among the publishers that the number of Southern buyers who attended the recent Trade sales in this City, greatly exceeded that of any former year. Whether this fact is attributable to an increased thirst for knowledge among the people of the South, or to the unanswerable assertion that Northern houses produce books of better quality more cheaply, it matters little. That buyers from Southern cities should not share in the panic, which we have previously demonstrated to have been far from general in other branches of trade, is very natural and reasonable. Literature, unlike dry goods, needs to be of prime quality to satisfy the appetite of thirsty readers; -- homespun may answer the requirements of bodily decency, but rough-edged books are neither seemly nor desirable. Wherefore this general verdict in favor of the New-York Book Market is a pleasant sign of the times. The activity of trade sends a current of new life through the book shops, and the sunniest-faced men you meet on Broadway to-day are the publishers. Curiously enough, the balance hangs nearly even between the religious and the secular.

"A short time since the child of one of our up town families was suddenly seized with a sickness which seemed so serious that immediately the family physician, a man of long beard, long bills, and its accompaniments, was sent for in great haste; but alas, he came not, and the sudden culmination of the disease into a terrific convulsion compelled the family to abandon their regular doctor and send for the nearest one, who proved to be an educated man of the old school -- a serious objection, indeed, to the family, but which, in their distressed situation, could not well be helped. The character of the difficulty was quickly perceived, and an emetic speedily removed a quantity of undigested and improper food, restoring the child to comparative health. The thanks of the whole family were prodigally bestowed upon the physician, the preserver of their child, who was requested to continue his attendance till the child was entirely recovered. The next morning brought the tardy Dr. PELLETS, who was met with a storm of reproaches for his neglect and inattention, and with the statement that if they had waited for him their child would now have been a corpse, and that now, as the doctor had done so much for them, they could never repay him, and be should continue to attend the child, and an intimation was held out that they should continue to employ him in the future. Dr. PALLETS could not afford to lose so valuable a family without a struggle to retain it; so he said commisseratingly: ""I regret, my dear madam, the alarm you have been under and the danger in which your darling beautiful has been.

They are organized as an auxiliary of the Domestic Board of Missions of the Presbyterian Church, and have contributed upwards of $4,000 to its funds. Their contribution last year was $265. An interesting feature of their relation to the Board is in having a particular missionary assigned to them, with whom they regularly correspond, so that they know precisely where and on whom their contributions are expended, and they receive regular reports and details of the cultivation of the field which is more especially their own. The missionary at present correspondent with them is Rev. ALLEN H. BROWN, (son of the late SILAS BROWN, of this City,) whose devoted labors in ""The Pines"" of New-Jersey have been, and continue to be, so largely blessed in establishing Sunday-Schools, and planting thrifty churches in that remarkable and too long neglected region.

When one reads the list of enterprises, as revealed by the witnesses which he personally directed -- the number of ""arrangements"" he superintended, now as ""the President,"" now as the Executive, now as ""J.B.,"" and now as JAMES BUCHANAN -- one is astonished, at the confidence expressed in the close of his letter to Governor WALKER, that Providence would bring him through them all. He must be either a very sanguine man or a very audacious one, to expect any such interposition on his behalf. He not only looked after BRIGHAM YOUNG and Kansas in the first year of his Administration, but he took special charge of almost all the Democratic newspapers in the country. He fixed the amounts which were to be paid to these struggling organs out of the proceeds of the public printing, and at what times they were to be paid; and more than all, he selected the particular newspapers that were to receive the largest contributions.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Busy President.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Busy President.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/afe2ef56-a64f-53f3-91af-623a02995c25,713,nyt://article/afe2ef56-a64f-53f3-91af-623a02995c25,

"A novel and very pretty ""application of the Arts to life"" took place on Thursday evening at the Cooper Institute. Certain rooms of that building have been for some time occupied, as our readers know, or ought to know, by the pupils of the New-York School of Design for Women. This excellent institution, under the supervision of a committee of accomplished ladies, and the very competent direction of Mr. T. ADDISON RICHARDS, has gradually begun to win for itself the place which it deserves to hold in the public estimation. Every effort to open new avenues of honorable personal independence to women is a duty done to society and to civilization. But the education of a class of young women in the principles and practice of the Arts of Design has a special value in this country, where the services of such a class are imperatively demanded by the backwardness of our manufacturing industry in those higher branches which depend for their vigor and fruitfulness upon the taste of the manufacturer. Beauty, as the industries of France have proved, has a market value all the world over; and the less-cultivated workmen of England have of late years been roused to recognize this fact, and to put themselves into training for a course of serious competition with the Gaul, whose subtle grace, passing into the fabrics of the furnace and the loom, had given him, at almost every point, the advantage over his British rivals. In America, the aesthetics of industry are still less fully developed than they are in England. Most of our leading manufacturers still import their ""designers"" from abroad. If the naturally tasteful instincts of our women can be fortified and educated into really artistic capacity, this condition of American manufactures offers them a wide -- almost an unbounded -- field for the honorable, useful, and profitable employment of their faculties, in a direction thoroughly congenial with the female nature, and eminently becoming in point of character. The New-York School of Design affords the means of securing this desirable end; and on Thursday evening the Lady Managers threw open the spacious rooms of the Cooper Institute to some hundreds of their own friends and the friends of the pupils of their school, in order that some sound judgment might be formed on the success which has already attended their enterprise. The galleries were filled with drawings and paintings by the pupils, more than a hundred in number, over whom Mr. RICHARDS exercises his artistic care. Many of the paintings were creditable as copies, but the chief interest of the exhibition belonged to the drawings, which offer the best indication of the progress of the pupils in the principles of design.

All the Councilmen present but one got wind of the joke, and enjoyed hugely the chagrin of the City Father who innocently believed that there was a serious intent to thus charitably dispose of his salary. He counted noses among the members to see whether the measure would pass. He tried to get away, so as to leave the Board without a quorum, but the Sergeant-at-Arms was sent after him. He vowed he ""wouldn't be robbed,"" he ""would test the matter in the courts,"" ""they never should get his money without his consent,"" he ""would give them a hard tug for it."" His brother members led him on, by debating the legality of the plan before him, and finally capped the climax by considering a resolution while the Board was waiting for a message from the Aldermen. They moved to refer it to various committees, including the one of which the victimized member was chairman, and worked him up to a pitch of excitement which may be imagined when it is remembered that he supposed he had the sum of $1,200 at stake.

"Soon after 12 o'clock on Saturday night a fata stabbing affray occurred in Orchard-street, near Canal, in which Thomas Greenan, a brass founder residing at No. 124 East Broadway, was the victim. Deceased, in company with his friend John Crinnion, had been spending the evening at the house of his brother, and while returning home together through Orchard-street, they were met by three Germans, one of whom jostled violently against Greenan, who thinking the act intentional, made use of abusive language. One of the Germans retorted and the altercation resulted in a fight, which ended in Greenan's obtaining the advantage of his antagonist. As soon, however, as he permitted the German to rise from the sidewalk, where he had thrown him, the latter stabbed him twice in the back, the wound penetrating both lungs, and producing almost instant death. The noise of the altercation attracted the attention of Officer Wright, of the Tenth Ward, who, learning the particulars of the case from Crinnion, obtained the assistance of other Policemen and started in pursuit of the Germans. Charles Robert, a young German baker, residing at No 34 Hester-street, was soon afterwards arrested, while endeavoring to obtain access to a saloon in the neighborhood, and after looking at him, Crinnion positively asserted that he was one of the three Germans who had occasioned the disturbance, and he also believed him to be the man who had used the knife. The prisoner denied an[???] knowledge of the affair, and said that he had been alone all the evening. He was, nevertheless, detained, as were Crinnion and a man named Samuel Calhoun, a witness of the affray, to await the result of an investigation which will be made by Coroner JACKMAN. The body was removed to the Tenth Ward Station-house, where Drs. Beach and Gallagher made a post mortem examination. They found two incised wounds between the shoulders and near the spinal column, which had probably been inflicted with a dirk knife, penetrating the lungs and sufficient to cause death in a very short time. A jury was summoned, but the Coroner decided to adjourn the examination of witnesses until to-day, when further evidence will probably be obtained.

In the opinion of the Committee, the system of models should be abolished, and only such models as, in the discretion of the Commissioner, were thought advisable to have, should be retained in the Patent Office. The model system was at present a great incumbrance to the Patent Office, occupying a great amount of room which should be devoted to other purposes, tending to confuse rather than simplify the transaction of business. Models, in most instances, were entirely useless, and Mr. Fisher himself, although in this particular the Committee did not entirely agree with him, thought that the system of models should be entirely abolished. At present the models not only produced confusion inside of the Patent Office, but it resulted in confusion, annoyance and expense outside of the Patent Office, and among parties interested in patents. One source of confusion arose from the fact that in many instances the models did not agree with the specifications and drawings. The drawings and specifications might perfectly correspond in all points, and a party having only these before him, and unable to inspect the model at Washington, would take his impression as to what was really intended to be patented from these, whereas an inspection of the model might discover something entirely different.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLYTECHNIC ASSOCIATION.; United States Patent Laws--Water-Heating Apparatus--Iron Buildings, &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'POLYTECHNIC ASSOCIATION.; United States Patent Laws--Water-Heating Apparatus--Iron Buildings, &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a1f7650c-3d9b-5e25-8b5b-724955bd3d8c,851,nyt://article/a1f7650c-3d9b-5e25-8b5b-724955bd3d8c,

At the last accounts, the coroner was holding an inquest over the body of TARTT. SIMMS made a statement before the jury, from which we infer he made no attempt to evade the law. As told to us his statement ran thus: He said he believed he ought to have killed TARTT three years ago, but lacking positive evidence that his suspicions were well grounded, he did not. On Monday morning, awhile before day, his wife got up out of bed, and was absent about a half an hour. She returned and went to bed again, but presently got up and went out of the house again. He arose and watched her movements cautiously. She went into a clump of bushes in one corner of the enclosure. There he saw her meet with another person, and he attempted to gain another point nearer, which he thought he could approach without being observed, and from which he thought he could hear what might be said, and see what might be done, as well as discover and identify the person she had met. While he was making this movement his wife and the person with her disappeared. Subsequently he met his wife in the house, and she told him that he 'needn't trouble himself about her any longer -- that she was going to leave him and wouldn't live with him any longer; that Mr. TARTT was coming that day and was to carry her away.' He said TARTT drove up to his gate that morning in a buggy, and deliberately got out and hitched his horse and came in. A quarrel ensued, and TARTT got out his knife, and he (SIMMS) got his double-barrel gun and shot him.

"The announcement in the newspapers of Dr. CHEEVER's intention to lecture on ""Northern Strikes and Southern Slavery,"" and ""God's Bill for Unpaid Wages,"" attracted quite a large audience last evening to the Church of the Puritans. The edifice was well-nigh, if not completely filled. The Doctor's text was taken from the fourth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Colossians. His discourse mainly turned on the first verse, in which the obligation is imposed on masters to give unto their servants that which is just and equal; knowing that they also have a master in Heaven. He represented this chapter as containing the most terrible denunciations of the sin of Slavery, on the ground that Slavery itself was the most terrible form of extortion. In arguing the point, he claimed that in the primitive days of the Church the exacting of labor, without compensation, was not only unknown but condemned. A Christian man was forbidden to lay the burden of Slavery on any other man. The relation of slaveholding was reprobated in the New Testament as sinful in itself. The crime of manstealing had been set down along with that of murder, as being subject to the penalty of death, and this was taught under the authority of the Gospel itself. No man could be a Christian and a slaveholder. This applied as well to those who oppressed the hireling laborer in the North to help to maintain slavery in the South -- to those who trod down the bleeding hearts of the workers, boys and girls, men and women, so truly described in HOOD's ""Song of the Shirt,"" -- those who, with their incomes of fifty, sixty, or seventy thousand dollars a year, paid away more in a single election to sustain the slave Democracy than they expended in a whole year's clerk hire, -- those who drove their laborer's as remorselessly as a factory does its spindles, compelling them, to his (Dr. CHEEVER's) personal knowledge, to labor into the hours of the Sabbath or so to overtax their powers that the Sabbath must be spent either in sleep or in the reaction of sensual indulgence. If due regard had been had for the dignity and rights of laboring men, as set forth in God's word, there would never have been such a crime as that of Slavery. The reducing of men to Slavery worked like a repressed elemental fire; nay worse, it was a macerating of them into masses in which they could be used as beasts of burden by ambitious despots who, as the instruments of Satan, degraded labor, and deprived it of its rights to knowledge, happiness, and liberty. It was the duty of Christians to obey God and break down the walls of such caste between capital and labor. They should obey God by taking the laborer by the hand, by regarding him as a brother, and by doing so they would pluck from out the world one-half of Satan's means for driving men into perdition. After God's declaration of the parent crime itself, nothing could be more astonishing than the recent declaration of a Christian minister to one of the congregations of this City, and in a Christian assemblage, that the buying and selling of men might be just. God's declaration was this, that either for the buying or selling of a man the offender shall be put unto death. Considered as a matter of natural light, Slavery was a sin, because it was wrong to withhold from a man that which is his due. If his work were worth a dollar a day, and any man withheld a part of that dollar from him, he stole from him just to that amount. Slavery was an act of still greater meanness, for instead of stealing merely a man's wages, it stole himself. ""The laborer is worthy of his hire."" And again, the Scripture says: ""The laborer is worthy of his reward."" The man who refused to do this was as bad as King JOHN, who, to extort money from a Jew, pulled a tooth every day from out the Hebrew's head until he complied with his demands. The extortioner was Mentioned among other great sinners as one who could not enter into the kingdom of Heaven. The Christian church would never keep company with the extortioner; it would never tolerate him while he committed such things as the institution of Slavery involved. According to the construction of our national law, by our national tribunal it was impossible to steal anything from the slave, because though as a laborer we owed him his wages, yet as a slave and chattel we, as owning himself, owed him nothing. There could be no possibility of stealing anything from a slave, because he possesses nothing; no possibility of committing adultery against him, because his marriage has no legal force; no hindrance to taking his wife and children from him, because he has no marital rights. Every slaveholder sustained this system with all its horrible concomitants -- its atheism, its debauchery, its brutality; and every church which favored slaveholding upheld it with all these moral enormities. The reverend doctor continued to urge that the Church was everywhere bound to use its utmost endeavors to procure the abolition of Slavery, and alluded incidentally to the sympathy for the abolition cause which had recently been expressed by Dr. CAUDLISH and others, at a public meeting in Edinburgh. He quoted freely from the speech of Mr. O'CONNOR, at the Union meeting in the Academy of Music, and characterizes that gentleman's theory that the natural condition of the colored race in this country is one of pupilage, as a doctrine not only arrogant but impious. He alluded also to the system of Slavery as it affects the commercial economy of the country, and declared that it Slavery were abolished, and the negro paid fair wages as a freeman, the wealth of both the North and South would be doubled. If, he said, such corruption of the heart as that exhibited in the speech to which he referred were not thrown off, it would grow on us; it would become hardened in us; the land would become a region of horror, as if the lizards and snakes of the Pre-Adamite world were crawling over us; the sin would enter into our bones; all the meanness, the fraudulence and the degradations -- all the brutality, the cruelty, the low wickedness, would enter into our character, and we should become a contempt among the nations. The evil influence would bore into us like an augur of solidified sulphuric acid. Did the passage of human enactments in favor of Slavery render it any less a violation of God's law? Did the compound hydraulic ram of legal interpretation diminish the guilt by making it wholesale? Dare the Church of God deny it to be sin, or encourage its existence as a matter of political expediency? Its vested rights were vested devils, assuming the figures of angels.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/23/archives/the-extortions-of-slavery-a-sermon-by-rev-dr-cheever.html,,"The announcement in the newspapers of Dr. CHEEVER's intention to lecture on ""Northern Strikes and Southern Slavery,"" and ""God's Bill for Unpaid Wages,"" attracted quite a large audience last evening to the Church of the Puritans.

His discourse mainly turned on the first verse, in which the obligation is imposed on masters to give unto their servants that which is just and equal; knowing that they also have a master in Heaven. He represented this chapter as containing the most terrible denunciations of the sin of Slavery, on the ground that Slavery itself was the most terrible form of extortion. In arguing the point, he claimed that in the primitive days of the Church the exacting of labor, without compensation, was not only unknown but condemned. A Christian man was forbidden to lay the burden of Slavery on any other man. The relation of slaveholding was reprobated in the New Testament as sinful in itself. The crime of manstealing had been set down along with that of murder, as being subject to the penalty of death, and this was taught under the authority of the Gospel itself. No man could be a Christian and a slaveholder. This applied as well to those who oppressed the hireling laborer in the North to help to maintain slavery in the South -- to those who trod down the bleeding hearts of the workers, boys and girls, men and women, so truly described in HOOD's ""Song of the Shirt,"" -- those who, with their incomes of fifty, sixty, or seventy thousand dollars a year, paid away more in a single election to sustain the slave Democracy than they expended in a whole year's clerk hire, -- those who drove their laborer's as remorselessly as a factory does its spindles, compelling them, to his (Dr. CHEEVER's) personal knowledge, to labor into the hours of the Sabbath or so to overtax their powers that the Sabbath must be spent either in sleep or in the reaction of sensual indulgence. If due regard had been had for the dignity and rights of laboring men, as set forth in God's word, there would never have been such a crime as that of Slavery. The reducing of men to Slavery worked like a repressed elemental fire; nay worse, it was a macerating of them into masses in which they could be used as beasts of burden by ambitious despots who, as the instruments of Satan, degraded labor, and deprived it of its rights to knowledge, happiness, and liberty. It was the duty of Christians to obey God and break down the walls of such caste between capital and labor. They should obey God by taking the laborer by the hand, by regarding him as a brother, and by doing so they would pluck from out the world one-half of Satan's means for driving men into perdition. After God's declaration of the parent crime itself, nothing could be more astonishing than the recent declaration of a Christian minister to one of the congregations of this City, and in a Christian assemblage, that the buying and selling of men might be just. God's declaration was this, that either for the buying or selling of a man the offender shall be put unto death. Considered as a matter of natural light, Slavery was a sin, because it was wrong to withhold from a man that which is his due. If his work were worth a dollar a day, and any man withheld a part of that dollar from him, he stole from him just to that amount. Slavery was an act of still greater meanness, for instead of stealing merely a man's wages, it stole himself. ""The laborer is worthy of his hire."" And again, the Scripture says: ""The laborer is worthy of his reward."" The man who refused to do this was as bad as King JOHN, who, to extort money from a Jew, pulled a tooth every day from out the Hebrew's head until he complied with his demands. The extortioner was Mentioned among other great sinners as one who could not enter into the kingdom of Heaven. The Christian church would never keep company with the extortioner; it would never tolerate him while he committed such things as the institution of Slavery involved. According to the construction of our national law, by our national tribunal it was impossible to steal anything from the slave, because though as a laborer we owed him his wages, yet as a slave and chattel we, as owning himself, owed him nothing. There could be no possibility of stealing anything from a slave, because he possesses nothing; no possibility of committing adultery against him, because his marriage has no legal force; no hindrance to taking his wife and children from him, because he has no marital rights. Every slaveholder sustained this system with all its horrible concomitants -- its atheism, its debauchery, its brutality; and every church which favored slaveholding upheld it with all these moral enormities. The reverend doctor continued to urge that the Church was everywhere bound to use its utmost endeavors to procure the abolition of Slavery, and alluded incidentally to the sympathy for the abolition cause which had recently been expressed by Dr. CAUDLISH and others, at a public meeting in Edinburgh. He quoted freely from the speech of Mr. O'CONNOR, at the Union meeting in the Academy of Music, and characterizes that gentleman's theory that the natural condition of the colored race in this country is one of pupilage, as a doctrine not only arrogant but impious. He alluded also to the system of Slavery as it affects the commercial economy of the country, and declared that it Slavery were abolished, and the negro paid fair wages as a freeman, the wealth of both the North and South would be doubled. If, he said, such corruption of the heart as that exhibited in the speech to which he referred were not thrown off, it would grow on us; it would become hardened in us; the land would become a region of horror, as if the lizards and snakes of the Pre-Adamite world were crawling over us; the sin would enter into our bones; all the meanness, the fraudulence and the degradations -- all the brutality, the cruelty, the low wickedness, would enter into our character, and we should become a contempt among the nations. The evil influence would bore into us like an augur of solidified sulphuric acid. Did the passage of human enactments in favor of Slavery render it any less a violation of God's law? Did the compound hydraulic ram of legal interpretation diminish the guilt by making it wholesale? Dare the Church of God deny it to be sin, or encourage its existence as a matter of political expediency? Its vested rights were vested devils, assuming the figures of angels.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EXTORTIONS OF SLAVERY.; A Sermon by Rev.

The National Committee, indeed, preserved yesterday the outward forms of discipline, and carried the body of the Convention, with its own programme, against the stormy remonstrances of a clamorous section. The regular delegations from New-York and Illinois were confirmed in the provisional possession of the floor, to which the Committee had admitted them, but excluded from action upon the organization of the Convention; and the attempts of one or two ""Wise men"" from Virginia to force a letter from Mayor WOOD upon the consideration of the inchoate body were defeated, Hon.

JOHN CRINNION, the friend of deceased, deposed that in passing down Orchard-street, about 12 o'clock on Saturday night, deceased jostled against one of three men who were approaching from the opposite direction, whereupon a fight ensued, during which both fell upon the walk, and when deceased got up he cried, ""I'm stabbed."" SAMUEL CALHOUN testified that he saw ROBERT soon after the affray occurred, standing at the doorway of a saloon near the corner of Canal and Orchard streets, and heard him remark, ""Me kill a man."" Very soon afterwards an officer came up and took the prisoner into custody, and when they reached the Station-house he claimed an umbrella that had been found at the scene of the affray. Officer WRIGHT, who apprehended the prisoner, deposed that a rag and some small change found in his pockets were covered with blood, and the lining of the pockets also had red spots upon it. PETER and GILBERT GAYLER, both Germans, swore that they were in the prisoner's company, at the corner of Canal and Orchard streets, at the time of the affray, when deceased and another person came up and said to ROBERT, ""Hallo, Bub!"" and offered to fight him. Finally, deceased struck the prisoner, and the two clinched, both falling to the ground in the struggle. They saw no knives drawn, but went away before the fight had terminated. The testimony of Drs. GALLAGHER and BEACH, who made the post mortem examination, was then taken, when the case was given to the jury, who soon returned a verdict that ""Deceased came to his death by wounds inflicted with some instrument by CHARLES ROBERT, while engaged in a street fight, on the 21st of April, 1860.

A resolution requesting the Chairman to nominate a Committee upon Credentials was then adopted. Upon a resolution to exclude the New-York Tammany delegates from the Committee, a vote was taken, which resulted 44 Ayes to 241 Noes. A vote requesting them to refrain from participation, in the proceedings until the Committee had reported, was rejected by a vote almost identical.

As the Catholic Church, founded and established by the Lord Christ for the everlasting salvation of mankind, has acquired the form of a perfect society by its divine character, it ought, therefore, in fulfillment of its sacred ministry, to possess that freedom by which it may not be subject to any civil Power. And furthermore, in order to obtain that, the Church required those guarantees which were in accordance with the conditions and necessity of the times. It was, therefore, in accordance with Divine Providence, that after the fall of the Roman Empire and its consecutive division into several kingdoms, the Romish Pope, whom Christ has established as the chief and the centre of his whole Church, obtained temporal power. Therefore, it has been ordered by God in the wisest manner, that as such a great number and variety of princes exist, the Holy Pope should enjoy that political liberty which is so much wanted in order to exercise his spiritual power, authority and jurisdiction in the whole world, without any impediments. And, therefore, it was necessary that the Catholic world should not have any reason to suppose that the Romish Pope is subject to any influence of temporal powers, or biassed in the exercise of the religious powers which the Holy See has to fulfill over the greater part of the Christians. It is easily understood that the dominion of our Roman Church, although having the appearance of something temporal, nevertheless is really of a spiritual character, by the holy distinction which it enjoys, and by the close ties by which it is connected with all Christian affairs. But this does not prevent that all these things which conduce to the secular welfare of the peoples may be obtained by the Church, as the history of the temporal reign of the Roman Popes during so many centuries shows most clearly. The general good and welfare of the peoples being increased by the temporal power which we are alluding to, it is not astonishing that the enemies of this Church endeavor to weaken and to embarrass it by many intrigues and all kinds of attempts.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""ITALY.; THE POPE'S BULL OF EXCOMMUNICATION, APOSTOLIC LETTFR OF OUR MOST HOLY MASTER, PIUS IX., POPE BY THE GRACE OF GOD, BY WHICH THE PUNISHMENT OF MAJOR EXCOMMUNICATION IS INFLICTED ON THE INVADERS AND USURPERS OF SOME OF OUR PONTIFICAL PROVINCES.PIUS P.P.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/25/archives/japanese-guests-and-newyork-hosts.html,,"We are sorry to see that the Board of Aldermen are preparing themselves for the reception of the Japanese Embassy, and still sorrier to find that they are intent upon showing them the "" Institutions."" The public is so familiar with what an Alderman means when he talks of showing anybody the ""Institutions"" of the City, that it is unnecessary for us to explain it further than to repeat that our ""Institutions,"" in Aldermanic parlance, include at least all the dirty and disagreeable places within the Municipal boundary. This practice of carting off all strangers to Blackwell's Island, and treating them to a minute inspection of the blotches and sores of our civilization, arose under a regime which, it is to be hoped, has now passed away. In the days of the Ten Governors, and in the old time before them, a tour of the ""Institutions"" meant a day of free whisky, and gratuitous cigars, and a general carouse, at the public expense. When a visit to the Island, in charge of distinguished foreigners, meant a day's eating and drinking, and boating, and joking with paupers, lunatics and convicts, we can hardly wonder that no stranger was ever allowed to escape the infliction. But the gentlemen now in charge of the ""Institutions"" have, it is to be hoped, taken measures to render the ""Island"" a less attractive resort for merry-making Committees of Reception than it used to be; and we hope, therefore, that a visit to the jails and hospitals of that savory locality will be left out of the list of tortures which are preparing for the unfortunate Japanese. When it is proposed to accord a public welcome to a stranger, one would think that even an Alderman might see the propriety of taking him to see nothing but a pleasant sight in itself -- of forcing upon him none but agreable thoughts and associations -- of exhibiting to him, in short, our best and brightest side, and not our worst and darkest. When a private individual welcomes a guest to his house, he puts on his best clothes, receives him in his best rooms, spreads before him his best fare and keeps him clear of everything that may be repulsive or unsightly. He never thinks of producing the dirty linen or spreading it out before him in the parlor, or of inviting him to peep into the sewer, or make an inspection of the kitchen sink, or an examination of his children down with the measles. All highly civilized communities should act upon the same rule in their corporate capacity. When a distinguished stranger visits Paris he is treated to a sight of all that is most wonderful, most glorious and most beautiful in the great capital. He is led through the picture galleries and the palaces. He is taken to drive, and hunt and shoot in the imperial parks and forests. He has his imagination fired by the sight of noble historic monuments. On the Champ de Mars he is shown the finest soldiers in the world defiling in all the pomp and pride and circumstance of matchless discipline and efficiency. If he is asked at all to visit scenes in which decrepitude, decay and disease are the most prominent features, it is where decrepitude, decay and disease call up the stirring memories of a heroic epoch, and where they are inseparably associated with the greatness and glory of France. If he enters an hospital at all, as an unsought courtesy, it is the great asylum which shelters the last relics of a grand generation, the oldest heroes of a nation of soldiers. In like manner, if he crosses the channel to London he visits the cathedrals, the Houses of Parliament, the royal palaces, the parks, the tower, and is complimented with a review on Woolwich Common. But in neither case does it enter into anybody's head to drag him to the retreats which society has in self-defence or in pity provided for vice and suffering. He is not led by the nose, under pretence of doing him a kindness, to inspect the cells and wards in which thieves and prostitutes expiate their wickedness, or in which friendless lunacy is left to rave and chatter. There are persons, no doubt, who, from philanthropic or other honorable motives, may desire to visit such scenes, but a polite host only reveals them on the visitor's own request.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Japanese Guests and New-York Hosts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Japanese Guests and New-York Hosts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Japan', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-04-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/489275e6-7296-50d2-b076-e945c2b21d01,1586,nyt://article/489275e6-7296-50d2-b076-e945c2b21d01,

The exhibition was entirely successful, and the superiority of this telegraph over all others in use for the same purpose, was made apparent to all. As the exhibition is to be open to the public for several days, during which all our citizens who feel an interest in the subject will have an opportunity to witness its operations for themselves, an extended description of it is unnecessary.

The alarm is first given to the head-quarters of the telegraph, by turning a crank in a box stationed nearest to the fire, (these boxes may be placed on every block,) and thence spread over the whole City, if necessary, by telegraphic wires, which connect with the tower bells of each District, with gongs at every engine-house, and also with small bells inside of every alarm-box -- any one of which, or all together, may be set to ringing instantaneously by the man in attendance at head-quarters. The gongs at the engine-houses, and the bells in the alarm-boxes, are not of such magnitude as to be a nuisance on account of their noise, for the first would not be heard outside the engine-houses, and the last can only be heard by putting the ear to the box; but their object is to enable all firemen, and such other citizens as desire the information, to ascertain the exact locality of a fire before running in pursuit of it. So with regard to the tower bells: the telegraph is enabled to ring them all simultaneously if necessary, but in ordinary cases only the bell of the District in which the fire is located would be set in motion. The locality of the fire is indicated by the number of strokes on the small bells in the alarm-boxes. Equal facilities are afforded to the Police Department by these alarm boxes, in enabling any policeman to call for assistance at any given point, and also to indicate the amount of help required. The whole apparatus is extremely simple, not liable to get out of order, and does its work with a rapidity, precision and certainty truly astonishing.

"The Democracy at Charleston are rapidly ""settling to their work."" They yesterday completed their organization, selecting Hon. CALEB CUSHING as their permanent Chairman, and appointing a Committee to draw up the platform on which they propose to stand or fall in the coming contest.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/25/archives/the-democracy-at-charleston.html,,"The Democracy at Charleston are rapidly ""settling to their work."" They yesterday completed their organization, selecting Hon. CALEB CUSHING as their permanent Chairman, and appointing a Committee to draw up the platform on which they propose to stand or fall in the coming contest. The nomination of General CUSHING so far indicates a brightening prospect of harmony in the party, that the illustrious orator of Massachusetts belongs to the ornamental staff rather than to any active division of the Democratic host. He is a disciple of the school of the Vicar of Bray, and represents the flesh-pots of Egypt rather than any section or faction fanatically bent on a victory or an exodus of principle. That he should have been chosen to preside over the Convention, shows that the ""cohesive force of the public plunder"" has not been absolutely paralyzed by the explosive force of sectional fanaticisms or personal animosities. The unprecedented adoption of a rule deferring all ballots for the Presidential nomination till the platform of the party shall have been squared and settled, is an unmistakable concession to the demands of the friends of Mr. DOUGLAS; and the vote by which it was also resolved that no majority of a delegation should have power to utter the voice of the State as a unit, unless in obedience to instructions given by the State Convention which appointed the delegation, if it be not a victory of the Douglas men, is at least a defeat of the so-called coalition of the Administration with the South. The front of this coalition is evidently broken. Whether it will be successfully rallied, upon the decisive battle over the platform, remains to be seen; but the proceedings of the Convention, up to this moment, while they do not, indeed, decisively prefigure the final harmony of the Democracy, very plainly intimate an impending defeat of the extreme Southern policy. A volunteer champion of this policy, indeed -- Mr. JOSIAH RANDALL, of Philadelphia, long a leading Whig, and lately made famous by his declaration to Mr. COBDEN that he ""had never known corruption to be used in an American election"" -- seems to have been severely disciplined yesterday by Mr. RICHARDSON, of Illinois, with the pretty general applause of the Convention.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Democracy at Charleston.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Democracy at Charleston.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-04-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9dfb2ad8-e354-55fd-abe6-964838d0ac45,375,nyt://article/9dfb2ad8-e354-55fd-abe6-964838d0ac45,

The Committee upon Organization reported as an additional rule, that individual members of uninstructed delegations may vote independently. A sharp contest ensued over this innovation, which was designed to set at liberty certain Douglas votes from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, otherwise overwhelmed by an unfriendly majority. Mr. JOSIAH RANDALL, a fragment from Old-Line Whiggery, opposed the new rule vehemently, exposing himself to a severe rebuke from Mr. RICHARDSON, of Illinois, for laying down laws to a party of which he is so recent a member. The personal altercation caused for a moment great excitement. A vote having been taken upon the motion to table the rule, the motion failed, ayes 101, noes 198. The rule was then adopted. An amendment to the resolution appointing a Committee upon the platform, declaring that no ballot shall be had until the Committee shall have reported, was offered, and after the Committee (whose names the telegraph fails to send us,) had been appointed, it was moved that the amendment be tabled. The motion was negatived, ayes 32 1/2, noes 270 1/2, and the amendment was unanimously accepted. A proposition to limit the time to be consumed by each member in speaking upon any question, occasioned some debate, but was finally postponed. Judge MEEK, of Alabama, submitted the platform adopted by the Convention of his State. It was referred to the Committee upon the Platform.

In the course of the morning the Committee on the Platform decided, in deference to Southern members who objected to its ambiguity, not to readopt the Cincinnati Resolutions; the vote -- 17 to 15. At the afternoon session, the Committee upon Credentials presented its report. In regard to contested seats, it admitted to the Convention the Richmond delegation from New-York, the Richardson delegation from Illinois, with Messrs. Doherty and Chapin, Douglas contestants from Massachusetts, and Messrs. Lanahan and Brandt, Douglas contestants from Maryland. A report from a minority, consisting of the Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Arkansas and California members, proposed to give seats to one-half of each New-York delegation, each half to cast seventeen votes. The reports having been read, Mr. BROOKS, of Alabama, and of course of the minority, proceeded to sustain its report. He was followed by Mr. WHITLEY, of Delaware, on the majority side, in a speech of effective strength. Mr. BARRY, of Mississippi, then spoke for the minority report in a harangue of much bitterness. The previous question was then demanded, and the minority report rejected, by a vote of 210 to 55. The negative vote was composed of the entire delegations of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas, with portions of those from Virginia, North Carolina, Missouri and California. South Carolina, it will be observed, supported the majority report; as did also Florida and Louisiana. The vote was understood to decide the question as to the nomination; and Mr. DOUGLAS is now regarded as the inevitable candidate, -- none but the Southern ultraists, whose extreme strength is denoted by the minority vote on the delegations, having any further purpose of opposition. The Platform Committee is expected to report to-day, and then the first ballot will doubtless remove all doubt.

It would be a waste of our space to cite in support of this assertion the rulings of Southern Courts on the trial of Abolitionists, or Anti-Slavery men, or Slave-traders. In more than one of what Mr. SEWARD chooses to call the ""capital States,"" judges have repudiated the authority of all previous decisions in Slave cases, not on the ground of their unsoundness in point of law, but because the public opinion of the district had changed since they were made. The effect of this monstrous doctrine upon the rights of free negroes, upon the emancipation of slaves by will -- a practice once so common -- and more recently upon the revival of the Slave trade, is something with which most of our readers are tolerably familiar, and upon which it is, consequently, unnecessary for us to descant at length. The Supreme Court itself has not been exempt from the fate which has overtaken the humbler and less pretentious tribunals of the States.

Mr. PENNIMAN is one of the few millionaires who has had the taste to select, as well as the ability to purchase, and the result has been one of the most elegant and recherche collections of household furniture and works of art to be found in any private residence in this country. Being about to spend several years in Europe with his family, he has put his whole domestic establishment under the hammer, and we venture to say that Mr. LEEDS never smiled upon a more select and fashionable throng of bidders than has gathered around him for the last two days. The sale of all that portion of the furniture not classed as works of art was completed yesterday. The prices paid were generally regarded as liberal, though not by any means reaching the original cost. The furniture of the two main pariors brought $2,000; that of the smaller rooms in proportion. Of the table furniture, the most expensive article was a claret set, with solid silver jug, plated tray with silver edges, and 24 ruby glasses with solid silver stems, which brought $170 -- original cost $400. An elegant ormolu cigar-stand brought $80. The family plate was not entered in the catalogue. The most important and the rarest portion of the sale will take place to-day, when the whole collection of works of art, comprising some of the choicest paintings, statuary, and artistic gems of various descriptions, to be found in any private residence in this City, will be offered for sale. Among the marble statuary are the productions of SPENCE, WYATT, TROCHEL, ROSETTI, TADOLINI, BENZONI and GREBNOUGH, all of which were purchased by Mr. PENNIMAN from the artists themselves. Among the gems are three studies in terra cotta, by TROCHEL, representing the ""Holy Family,"" ""Death of Adonis,"" and ""Pandora."" Also, several elegant Roman bronze groups by HOFTGARTEN.

But his piety is only periodical, and bears a striking resemblance to the way in which old Touchwood's sons ""feared the Lord."" These sons were sadly addicted to wicked practices; and one Sunday morning the minister of the parish met one of them starting for the woods with a gun on his shoulder. Seeking out the father, the clergyman told him that he ought to admonish his sons, and bring them up in the fear of the Lord. ""Fear the Lord,"" replied old Touchwood, ""they are so afraid of him now that they daren't stir out on Sunday without a double-barreled shot-gun in their hand!'

The revolutions of the wheel were not timed or counted, but the entire machinery worked admirably. The boilers, which are yet to be covered, showed no evidences of leaky joints, and the large number of gentlemen who witnessed the working of the steamer predicted that, in her running time, she would exceed the calculations previously made, of fifteen miles an hour.

LEE  LARNED for their use.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/27/archives/city-intelligence.html,,"ANOTHER NEW STEAM FIRE ENGINE.--Yesterday was a day of jubliee with the active and honorary members of Southwark Engine Company No. 38, the occasion being the reception of a beautiful steam fire engine that has just been completed at the Novelty Works by Messrs. LEE LARNED for their use. The cost of the machine is about $5,000; it is 11 feet in length, exclusive of the pole, and weighs 5,300 pounds. Having large wheels and sensitive springs, it will run, however, as easily as an ordinary, fire-engine of 500 or 600 pounds less weight, and easier than the average of first-class hand-engines. Its best single stream for distance is 1 1/4 inch diameter, but for ordinary fire duty it will handle, with good effect, two one-inch streams, drawing its own water. The steam-power is derived from one of LEE & LARNED's patent annular boilers, of 225 feet of heating surface, with which steam can be raised to working pressure in from 6 to 8 minutes. The pump, which is of brass, and highly finished, is CARY's patent rotary, driven by a single reciprocating engine of 9 inches bore and 8 1/2 inches stroke, with a pair of balance-wheels to carry it over the centres. It is intended to make from 200 to 400 revolutions per minute. An elaborately-ornamented bronze lamp, having a triple series of powerful lenses, and resting on a highly-polished silver air-globe, is placed in front of the engine. This lamp, which is a very artistic production, was made by DE VOURSNEY BROTHERS, and cost the company $250. After receiving the engine at the Novelty Works, the company paraded down Broadway, preceded by Dodworth's Band, passing through Wall, and several of the other principal streets downtown, returned to the Engine-house, No. 28 Ann-street, where the event was commemorated with a collation. Southwark Company, without being invidious, may be said to be among the finest in the City, and, by obtaining the steam-engine, has again placed itself among the pioneers in the introduction of improved engines in the Fire Department -- the double-bank or Philadelphia-style engine having been first used in New-York by this Company, although its introduction excited great opposition, for the machine was looked upon as an innovation, the same as steam-engines are by a portion of the Department at this time. Mr. GEORGE T. ALEER is Foreman, and Mr. S. HAGAN Assistant-Foreman of the Company, whose complement is 70 men, many of the members being down-town merchants. Now, that they have obtained a new engine, the company justly feel that the City should provide them a more suitable house than their present cramped quarters. This is the third steam fire-engine that has been surrendered to the Fire Department, Companies Nos. 42 and 8 having the others. Messrs. LEE & LARNED have ten more in course of construction, 5 of which are for this City, and the remainder for different parts of the country. Orders for the manufacture of six others have been received by the builders.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/72424d31-7e55-569e-bd14-bdb48026bbe8,2221,nyt://article/72424d31-7e55-569e-bd14-bdb48026bbe8,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/27/archives/the-south-at-charleston.html,,"The critical conflict is now waging in the Democratic camp. The Committee on the Platform, ""this way and that inclining its swift mind,"" is discussing the extreme point at which a reasonable regard to the possibilities of Federal success can be conciliated with judicious concessions to the angry and rather irrational exigencies of excited Southern feeling. Whether that point can be found, and whether, being found, a working majority of the Convention can be induced to recognize it, are questions not to be settled at this distance, and by spectators. If we are to accept the representations of the delegates who are acting under the command of the ultra Southern leaders as the infallible indications of the settled Southern sentiment, we must believe that it cannot and will not be either found or recognized. In that case, we may expect a volcanic explosion of the whole Convention, and with it the final disruption and disarray of the Democratic Party, with other consequences too remote and too important to be dwelt upon here. But those who are watching the progress of affairs at Charleston with impartial and disinterested eyes, will do well to remember that the intensity with which the great captains of the Southern host press their absolute demand for a recognition of slaves as mere downright property, to be protected always and everywhere like any other property, is seriously aggravated by the personal hostility of these captains to the most conspicuous of the Democratic candidates. This fact is so well understood at Charleston that it can hardly fail to have its effect upon the deliberations of the Convention. And should the partisans of power, ""pure and simple,"" the seekers after place and authority, who are at least as numerous in the South as in the North, and in the Democratic as in the Republican ranks, eventually make up their minds to the hope of victory rather than to the assertion of doctrine, it is quite possible that a secession, general or partial, of certain delegations, such as those of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, may take place from the Convention, without at all entailing the secession from the party of those States themselves in the subsequent hour of the Presidential election. A delegate from Alabama, Mr. PERCY WALKER, yesterday indicated the existence of a decided Southern under-tow in the direction of a practicable policy, by offering a resolution asserting the duty of Congress to afford ""all legal protection to slave property in the Territories and on the high seas."" This resolution, which might be offered and passed at Chicago as well as at Charleston, may perhaps prefigure the real character of the new ""platform"" which is to replace the platform of Cincinnati. It would certainly have this advantage over the programme upon which Mr. BUCHANAN was carried into power -- that it will bear a much larger variety of interpretations than that venerable ""scheme of faith,"" while at the same time it will doubtless be far more emphatic in phraseology, and more imposing in its superficial aspect of constitutional fidelity to the rights of everybody everywhere. The fate of the Democracy, and with that fate the tone of the coming contest for the Presidency, rests now with this much-burdened ""Committee on the Platform,"" and with the chaos of recommendations out of which it is striving to educe a feasible order of battle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The South at Charleston.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The South at Charleston.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/85202d6c-33d5-5ffd-bbff-335b847e6b1b,965,nyt://article/85202d6c-33d5-5ffd-bbff-335b847e6b1b,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/27/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The happy family at Charleston has fallen into melancholy discord, the Platform being the apparently incurable source of distraction. The Southern delegations, encouraged by outside influences hostile to Mr. DOUGLAS, insist upon the insertion of a clause approving of Congressional intervention for the protection of slaveholders in the Territories. The Convention was wholly occupied yesterday in listening to propositions of this tendency, under every form of modification; the most explicit and extreme emanating, it is understood, from the pen of Mr. SLIDELL, of Louisiana. Members from Pennsylvania and Rhode Island presented more moderate forms of the doctrine; and all as fast as produced were referred to the Committee upon the Platform. That Committee has thus far been unable to complete its report. Serious differences are said to exist among the members as to the Territorial question, and it is even stated that three reports will be presented, and the selection from them be left to the Convention. A majority is represented to be favorable to a resolution yesterday offered to the Convention by Mr. WALKER, of Alabama, and referred, which declares it to be the duty of the Government to provide for the protection of the property of American citizens, as well within the United States and the Territories, as upon the high seas. With these vague terms, the question, it is hoped, may be postponed. At the close of the proceedings yesterday, a resolution requiring the Committee to report progress this morning at 10 o'clock was adopted. The excitement is intense. All manner of assertions and speculations obtain currency; among others, a statement that the adoption of the dogma of Federal protection to slave property in the Territories will be the signal for the Douglas party to bolt. The delegations from the Gulf States are loud in their declaration, that if Squatter Sovereignty be not distinctly repudiated in the platform, they will retire and place in nomination JEFFERSON DAVIS and FERNANDO WOOD. As there is no likelihood of this being done, and as Mr. DOUGLAS has required his friends to insist upon the insertion of the doctrine in question, the secession may be regarded as certain. At Washington last evening the impression had gained ground that the Convention would be obliged to disperse without nominating. The friends of Mr. DOUGLAS, on the other hand, are confident of his nomination, and care nothing for the threatened schism.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ef9f898-aa86-5dd0-9e78-50938e3637f2,1431,nyt://article/9ef9f898-aa86-5dd0-9e78-50938e3637f2,

"JUSTICE on, NOT in, THE CITY HALL. -- The appearance of various ropes and pullies and spars, on the summit of the City Hall Cupola yesterday, gave that venerable edifice the look, at a distance, of having been rigged up for marine service. And the belief prevailed to some extent that our recent proposition for floating the hall up the river to Albany was about to be put in execution. The fact, however, that the cables pending from the summit reached the ground, and were tied to the trees in the park, gave rise to directly opposite opinions. And the rumor was not long in originating and spreading, abroad that the Governor had signed the bill for removing the Hall, and that the enemies of the bill, determined on resistance, had taken this means of anchoring the pile to the spot. Among a variety of other opinions that prevailed was one that the Mayor, in view of the shock which the country will sustain when the ""Charleston split"" shall occur, had telegraphed order to have the City steeple stayed by guys lest u should tumble down in unsightly ruins, to remain a public eyesore to another generation, as the remains of its predecessor did to the last. The conviction at last became general that the ropes and pullies were merely to be used in hoisting a statue of justice to its place on the cupola while the Mayor is away.

There were three minority reports, each differing in regard to this resolution; the Douglas wing declining to abandon the Cincinnatti doctrine of popular sovereignty, and the Davis faction demanding a more explicit declaration of the protective dogma. An excited discussion followed the the presentation of the reports, Mr. AVERY, of Tennessee, appealing to them to yield; and Mr. PAYNE, of Ohio, eloquently appealing to the South not to sacrifice the party for an abstraction. Mr. BUTTER, of Massachusetts, implored the Convention to reiterate simply the Cincinnati Resolutions, predicting the destruction of the party at the North upon any other platform. Mr. COCHRANE, of this City, submitted a substitute for the disputed resolve in which he equally conceded the doctrine of the federal obligation to protect Slavery in the Territories.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/30/archives/city-intelligence-how-the-news-of-the-prize-fight-was-received-in.html,,"Mr. EMERSON'S celebrated dictum, ""When half gods go the gods arrive,"" was whimsically illustrated in this City on Saturday morning. When the small impostors who had ""taken in"" the whole City, from the First Ward to the Fifth-avenue, on Wednesday night with their false tale of the ""Great Fight,"" went forth shouting at the top of their shrill voices the real news brought by the Vanderbilt, they found their market just as fresh as if Astraea had always sat in the printing-offices, and hoaxes were as little known in New-York as we are bound to suppose they were in Arcadia. Their ""sell"" had produced no more ill effect upon their trade than the kindred ""sell"" perpetrated by their London fellow-venders. For it appears that on Monday evening, the 16th, the Cockneys were enormously humbugged in like manner with the Gothamites, by ""Extras,"" announcing the great fight as having come off that morning. Only, with a patriotic eye to ready custom, the London extra-merchants of course proclaimed the ""defeat of HEENAN,"" just as ours published the ""defeat of SAYERS."" The Vanderbilt had truly and unquestionably brought the news. Her passengers brought it, and rapidly dispersing to their hotels and homes, sent it circulating all over the City. Some of them even had seen the great battle-field, and one at least declared that with his eyes he had beheld the evil-minded JOHN MORRISSEY inflict that cut upon the ropes which perhaps saved SAYERS from strangulation, and almost certainly cost the Benicia Boy his hard-won belt. Her mails brought it, and struck off upon the ""manifold"" of the Associated News Agent; it was rapidly transferred to the presses of a dozen morning journals, and thence shot forth in flights of ""extras"" far and near. Ten thousand of these were disposed of from the TIMES office alone, within half an hour, thanks to the promptitude with which we always present ourselves, first alike at feast and fight. Then followed the vast packages of illustrated newspapers -- Wilkes' Spirit of the Times, Frank Leslie's and the Illustrated News -- struck off in England, ordered and assorted on the voyage, and scattered broadcast immediately upon the arrival of the Vanderbilt. It is safe to say that nearly a hundred and fifty thousand of these sheets went into circulation at the rate of sixpence a piece before 10 o'clock of Saturday morning. By noon, therefore, of the same day everybody in New-York who ever knows that anything has happened since Gen. JACKSON crushed the bank knew that HEENAN and SAYERS had met, not exactly in the ""tented field,"" but in the ""roped arena;"" that two thousand Englishmen and half a hundred Yankees had watched the varying progress of the conflict between them for more than two hours; and noted with eager exultation or reluctant despair the gradual obliteration of all signs of humanity from one and the other of those interesting pair of countenances; that HEENAN had knocked the English champion down, at least thirty times, and had been himself only once; that the B.B. had exhibited the most unlooked-for ""game"" qualities, taking, with smiles as long as he could, and when he got beyond smiles, with affable grins, which would, no doubt, have frightened any two-year-old child into convulsions and idiocy, a ""punishment"" which gradually closed up his left eye altogether, and put his two cheeks on a level with his nose, and that the final result had been overwhelmed in utter mystery and uncertainty by a rush of the English mob upon the ropes, and a general ""muss,"" evaporating in the police and a promiscuous scamper from the grounds.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; How the News of the Prize Fight was Received in the City.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; How the News of the Prize Fight was Received in the City.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23c1d7aa-2353-561c-ac6a-fb0cb773ba2a,2049,nyt://article/23c1d7aa-2353-561c-ac6a-fb0cb773ba2a,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/30/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The Charleston Convention passed an inharmonious and unsatisfactory day on Saturday, wrangling over the question of a platform, and finally recommitting the whole subject to the Committee, whence it was again reported at the afternoon session. Early in the day, the Bayard resolutions were presented by Mr. BIGLER, who supported them in a speech, in which he pleaded for conciliation, but pleaded in vain. The resolutions affirmed the Cincinnati Platform, rejected the doctrine of squatter sovereignty, and left the question of slave property to be settled by the Supreme Court. After an angry contest, the resolutions were recommitted to the Committee by one majority -- Ayes 152, Nays 151. The entire New-York vote was cast in the negative. The minority vote was regarded as the first test of DOUGLAS' strength in the Convention. The Georgia delegation had a minority of Douglas men, who remonstrated against a decision that the vote of that State must be cast as a unit, and it asserted that DOUGLAS lost two votes by this manoeuvre. The platforms having been recommitted, the Convention took a recess at 5 1/2 P.M. The Platform Committee returned with two reports. The majority report was presented by Mr. AVERY of North Carolina. It sets out with an affirmation of the Cincinnati platform, subject to certain explanatory resolutions, which declare that all citizens have a right to settle in the Territories, ""without their rights, either of person or property, being destroyed or injured by Congressional or Territorial legislation;"" that it is the duty of the Federal Government to protect these rights; and that the State sovereignty begins only with the formation of a State Constitution. The remainder of the majority platform goes for Cuba, the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave law, and a Pacific Railroad. The minority report of the Committed presented by Mr. SAMUELS, of Iowa, also reaffirms the general principles of the Cincinnati Platform; but meets the question of the Territories by declaring that ""inasmuch as differences of opinion exist,"" the Democratic Party ""will abide by the decision of the Supreme Court over the institution of Slavery within the Territories."" The acquisition of Cuba and the construction of a Pacific Railroad are planks of this report, similar in all respects to those laid down by the majority. Mr. SAMUELS made a powerful appeal to Southern members to adopt the report of the minority. He expected the South not to persist in ""an abstraction which would drive one-half the Northern Democrats into the army of the Black Republicans,"" and it appears that he was heard by the fire-eating party with respectful attention. Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, presented a third report, which proposed the adoption of the Cincinnati Platform, without explanations or addenda. A violent discussion followed the reception of the reports, in the midst of which a motion prevailed to adjourn until Monday morning. The friends of Mr. DOUGLAS profess to feel entire confidence in the nomination of their candidate, and count up the votes they rely upon to secure that result; while to outsiders the prospects of that gentleman appear to darken with every day of delay.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-04-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/83ef5d93-1d99-5d7f-a772-8bc7b891124d,1537,nyt://article/83ef5d93-1d99-5d7f-a772-8bc7b891124d,

"The inquest upon the body of VALENTINE COURTNEY, an aged pauper, who died in the Almshouse on Blackwell's Island, on the 24th inst., in consequence of injuries received in some unascertained manner, was concluded yesterday by Coroner JACKMAN. From the evidence it appears that deceased was sent to the Island on the 20th inst., on a charge of vagrancy, he being of intemperate habits, and in destitute circumstances. He was placed in a cell with two idiotic persons, and received similar treatment to the other prisoners, with the exception that he was not required to perform any labor. He seemed to be in perfect health up to Tuesday morning last, when his keeper found him in his cell, in a dying condition. He was immediately removed to the Hospital, but his death, speedily resulted. Upon a post mortem examination the skull of deceased was found fractured, his ribs nearly all broken, his shoulder dislocated and shattered, and terrible bruises on his limbs. No evidence, however, was elicited as to the manner in which these injuries were inflicted. The keepers state that they heard no noise in the cell that the unfortunate man occupied, neither were there any signs of a disturbance having taken place there, and the supposition is that, in wandering about the grounds the deceased fell into a stone quarry, although it is difficult to understand how in such a terribly mangled condition he could have returned to the Almshouse without the knowledge of his keepers, particularly as his injuries were such that the physicians think his death must have quickly followed their infliction. In their verdict the Jury, after enumerating the injuries to deceased, say: ""We believe the injuries were received but a short time previous to his death, and consequently after his admission to the Workhouse. And we censure in the severest terms, the keeper, who, having plenty of empty cells, placed the deceased in a cell with idiots or crazed prisoners, wholly irresponsible for their actions, and who may at any time violently assail a fellow-prisoner.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/30/archives/coroners-inquests-another-case-of-mismanagement-in-the-insti.html,,"The inquest upon the body of VALENTINE COURTNEY, an aged pauper, who died in the Almshouse on Blackwell's Island, on the 24th inst., in consequence of injuries received in some unascertained manner, was concluded yesterday by Coroner JACKMAN.
