"We really know no reason why the Judges of the Superior Court should sacrifice their lives in order to gave the City the expense of providing decent, well-ventilated rooms for the discharge of their official duties.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/01/archives/the-judges-purgatory.html,,"We really know no reason why the Judges of the Superior Court should sacrifice their lives in order to gave the City the expense of providing decent, well-ventilated rooms for the discharge of their official duties. One Judge, at least, has already succumbed to the influences of the foul atmosphere by which the court-rooms at present in use are pervaded during the entire day; another has recently been compelled to go to Cuba for three or four months in order to recruit his shattered health, and unless those who still remain at their posts are more than human, they are steadily undermining their constitutions every hour they occupy the Bench. The two rooms which are most crowded, those devoted to the Special and Trial Term, are not larger than good-sized parlors in an average dwelling-house, and their ceilings are lower than those to be found in any average private house in the City built within the last ten years. There is no means of ventilation except that afforded by throwing the windows wide open; a remedy which in Winter weather is of course much worse than the disease it is meant to relieve. The result is, that from 10 A.M. to the rising of the Court, the air is not simply bad, it is pestiferous. Jurymen and witnesses suffer enough from it, but their tortures at least do not last long. For a judge there is no release. He must sit, day after day, calm, collected, good-tempered, with all his senses awake, all his faculties in full activity, swallowing deadly poison at every breath.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Judges' Purgatory."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Judges' Purgatory."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/064cc45b-0664-5e5e-8eb0-7503a416136a,683,nyt://article/064cc45b-0664-5e5e-8eb0-7503a416136a,

The expected election of Speaker did not take place yesterday. It has been confidently proclaimed on the Democratic side that the only difficulty in the way of the organization of the House was the persistence of the Republicans in the support of a candidate for Speaker who was obnoxious to the conservative sentiment of the country by his indorsement of the Helper book.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/01/archives/party-at-washington.html,,"The expected election of Speaker did not take place yesterday. It has been confidently proclaimed on the Democratic side that the only difficulty in the way of the organization of the House was the persistence of the Republicans in the support of a candidate for Speaker who was obnoxious to the conservative sentiment of the country by his indorsement of the Helper book. On Monday, to escape an anticipated defeat in case they obstinately insisted on SHERMAN, the Republicans reluctantly consented to drop him and take up Mr. PENNINGTON, a well-known conservative, against whom no similar objection could be urged; but it seems that our Democratic friends are in equal consternation at the prospect of his election, and, at the appeal of Mr. ASHMORE that another vote would secure the inevitable result, they insisted upon an adjournment, to see if some combination could not be effected which would wrest the victory from the Republicans. It was no doubt unwise for the Republicans to continue their adhesion to Mr. SHERMAN so long, especially as they have been compelled to give him up at last; but the proceedings of yesterday pretty clearly evince that his connection with the Helper book was not the only secret of the violent opposition which he has encountered. The head and front of his offending, of course, has been that he is a Republican. The indignant eloquence which has been expended in denouncing him for contributing to the circulation of a campaign document which he had been thoughtless enough to indorse without reading, has not been purely patriotic. Something of its energy must be credited to the violent spirit of party which has been manifested on both sides of the House in this whole contest for the Speakership. It is this spirit of party which has inspired the factious and disorganizing scenes which have been witnessed in the Hall of Representatives during the past eight weeks, which openly avows, as in the columns of the Tribune, that its policy is ""to rule or ruin,"" and which, unless it shall be effectually rebuked by the people, will eventually leave them nothing of liberty but the name, and establish a practical despotism, which, under the forms of Republican institutions, will give us over to the sway of vociferous demagogues and the control of irresponsible factions.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Party at Washington.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Party at Washington.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5939e183-1b3f-532b-8db0-e38acc572935,386,nyt://article/5939e183-1b3f-532b-8db0-e38acc572935,

The absentees numbered seven, five of them being Democrats. Mr. SHERMAN having moved that the House proceed to vote viva voce, the vote was taken, several gentlemen interpolating speeches as it proceeded. Mr. SMITH, of North Carolina, spoke, declining to run longer as a candidate. Mr. REAGAN spoke, nominating Mr. MCCLERNAND in the stead of Mr. SMITH. Mr. HILL (American) would not support MCCLERNAND. Mr. ETHERIDGE (American) was quite ready to support him. Mr. MILLSON entreated the conservatives to rally to the new candidate, and an animated debate ensued. Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland, voted for Mr. PENNINGTON. Other South Americans threw away their votes, promising to recover and use them when they could be made effective. Mr. ASHMORE, of South Carolina, exhorted these and the other South Americans to sustain MCCLERNAND, if they feared to see a Republican in the Chair. As 233 members voted, 117 were necessary to a choice. Mr. PENNINGTON received 116, Mr. MCCLERNAND 91; the remainder scattering. The Democrats moved an adjournment, which after some resistance on the part of the Republicans, was carried; there being an understanding that another vote should be had immediately upon the meeting of the House today. In the Senate, Mr. HUNTER spoke upon the resolutions of Mr. DOUGLAS. He reviewed the relations of the North and South; showed the industrial dependence of the former upon the latter, asserted that the entire energies of the Federal Government had been devoted to fostering Northern prosperity, referring for evidence to the several protective tariffs, and to the creation of the United States Bank at Philadelphia; and argued that the present tendencies of Northern sentiment were irreconcilable with the safety and dignity of the South. As to any design of the North to prevent forcibly a Southern attempt at secession, he desired to know how the States invaded by Northern armies were to be held -- whether as subjugated provinces or as sovereign States in a sort of Federal tutelage. He could see no constitutional provision for the compulsion threatened; and therefore declared that the very first belligerent act of the Northern defenders of the Constitution, would be a departure from and violation of that instrument.

The Sound steamers are doing as much business now as during the same months last year. The passenger traffic by these lines is also increasing. The steamers of the various Southern lines continue to go fully freighted, there being a marked augmentation in shipments to the principal ports, the first fruits of the Spring business. At one of the down town hotels there were yesterday about sixty guests from Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, the majority merchants and traders who have come North to purchase Spring goods. Of the five Southern lines, employing an aggregate of twenty steamers, only one, the Alabama, is unemployed, and she is having new boilers put in, and undergoing thorough repairs, to take her place on the line in about two week. All these vessels are profitably employed, with a fair prospect of enlarged occupation during the two succeeding months. The large passenger steamers of the different Hudson River lines are in the hands of the mechanics, being painted and otherwise refitted for the approaching Summer campaign. From the present mild weather, they anticipate an early opening of navigation to Albany. The New World will take her place on the old route as soon as navigation opens, thoroughly refitted and restored. The smaller steamers, which have been interrupted in their business by the ice, and the usual cessation of travel during the Winter months, are undergoing repairs for the renewal of the Spring travel. The steamer Long Island has been and is now running upon her old line to the different towns on the north shore of Long Island.

For more than half a century this odious commerce has withstood the denunciations of successive philanthropists; the proscriptive legislation of mighty States; the incessant surveillance, and destructive attacks of hostile squadrons -- yet it is still prosperous, still flourishing. Every letter from the African coast brings us intelligence of the capture of one or more of the vessels engaged in it -- our present correspondent announces that of five; but the profits accruing from the trade are so enormous that even these disasters cannot deter the losers from following their horrid avocation, one fortunate venture out of every four being sufficient to indemnify and remunerate them for all risk, all failure. Nor are the wholesale dealers in their fellowmen unmindful of the convenience of their customers. From Cape Palmas to Loando, according to our informant, there is one barracoon, or slave-depot, to every twenty miles of the coast, so that on the slightest relaxation of the vigilance of the cruisers, the traders can readily take in their human cargo, and be off with them to Cuba or Brazil. Now, the plain inference from all these facts, and from the ill success of the attempts hitherto made, both by England and the United States, at vast expense, as well as sacrifice of life, to suppress it, is that the African Slave-trade cannot be put down while there exist countries which desire and are willing to pay a high price for negroes. It is a fundamental axiom of political economy, not less applicable to the present than to other cases, that the supply and value of any article are ultimately regulated by the demand; with the increase of that, the supply and value of the given commodity will increase; with the decline of that, they will diminish. As long as the slave-dealer has a market, where he can obtain $800 or $1,000 a head for his cargo of 500 or 600 Africans, he will brave all dangers in the prosecution of a commerce which, despite of risk and loss, will make him quickly rich. But let him be shut out from this emporium, and confined to markets where few slaves suffice, and their price is low, and he will soon tire of hazarding life and capital in a business so unremunerative; let him be excluded from all marts, and his occupation, like Othello's, is at once gone. Now if the nations that are in vain essaying to annihilate the African Slave Trade, would see their efforts crowned with success, they must employ all their influence to obtain the cooperation of those States which at present foster and sustain it. True, they may fail of this object. The said States may refuse to cooperate with them in the godly work, on the ground that slave-labor is essential to the cultivation of their fields, and that their legislating against it would convert those fields into a wilderness. For these reasons, we say, the Governments that still continue to patronize the African Slave-Trade may decline to become parties to its proscription, yet the attempt to induce them to do so ought to be again and again made, as without their cooperation, that traffic will in the future, no less than in the past, prove irrepressible.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Slave-Trade Still Prosperous.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Slave-Trade Still Prosperous.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'AFRICA', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c96f29a6-61f4-5995-a2a2-53205905dbb6,1280,nyt://article/c96f29a6-61f4-5995-a2a2-53205905dbb6,

Mr. DOUGLAS' bill for assuring peace between the States was the order of the day, but in the report of the speech we cannot find so much as an allusion to this wise and conservative measure. Mr. HUNTER's whole argument was given apparently to prove that the ""peculiar institution"" is the highest form of civilization -- ""the normal condition of society"" -- ""the black-marble keystone of the mighty arch of the Union,"" and ""that there is no nation known to history that has not built up its foundation on this system."" All this may be perfectly true or perfectly false, keystone, foundation and all, and we know no reason why Mr. HUNTER should not air his theories -- provided they do not interfere with the public business. Since the commencement of the Session, Senators have had abundant leisure to speak in this way, there having been nothing to do in the way of legislation while the House remained unorganized. And surely they might well spend their time much worse. An ingenious argument, even when we do not accept its conclusions, sets us a-thinking, and a sophism, the fallacy of which demands never so slight an exercise of acuteness to detect, is positively refreshing. But we cannot in conscience say that Mr. HUNTER has gratified our reasonable hopes of entertainment. He has neither impressed us by the philosophy, nor startled us by the novelty of his notions. His historical statements were not fortified by fact, and his theories were sadly bare of illustration. It was the same old glorification of Slavery which we are all of us, Northerners and Southerners both, beginning to know by heart, relieved at intervals by some very passable flourishes of rhetoric, and concluding with the stereotyped eulogy on the stars and stripes, and the fervent, and no doubt honest, prayer for the perpetuity of the Republic.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Irrepressible Conflict.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Irrepressible Conflict.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1271214a-e137-5d0a-86ac-f811c2be50b9,1588,nyt://article/1271214a-e137-5d0a-86ac-f811c2be50b9,

Melinda is a widow, and has managed to obtain a precarious living by sewing wherever she could find work. Two months since she was engaged by Mrs. McCormack to live with her at Hempstead as nurse and seamstress. She seemed so trustworthy that Mrs. McCormack placed the greatest confidence in her, and last week, when the captain was about to start on a voyage, left home, as usual, to spend a few days with him in the City. The opportunity, she alleges, was improved by Melinda to pack up all the valuables in the house, with which she started for New-York, leaving the three children, the eldest of whom was but eight years of age, to get along as best they could. On Monday, when Mrs. McCormack returned, she found her house deserted. She was fortunate enough to find her little ones at a neighbor's, where they had wandered, after having spent a a day or two by themselves. Mrs. McC. subsequently returned to the City, and made the case known to Detective McDougal, who yesterday succeeded in apprehending the delinquent nurse at a house in Lewis-street, where a part of the stolen property was found. The woman afterwards gave information which led to the recovery of the rest from parties to whom she had disposed of it. The prisoner was taken before Justice KELLY, to whom she acknowledged her guilt, adding that she must have been crazy at the time of its commission.

The unfortunate and apparently chronic dead lock at Washington keeps the political pool in this quarter in a state of almost total stagnation. The only ripple which stirs its waters, never so gently, arises from the puffing of divers favorites as candidates for the next Presidential campaign, through the columns of those sonorous oracles of their respective parties or f(r)actions in both State and City -- the Republican and the Democrat. In most cases these are doubtless employed merely as tubs for the public whale to play with, and knock about with his iron flukes, or crush into oblivion in his cavernous jaws. In one instance, however, there is a studied and consistent advocacy which will carry weight with it at the proper time and point of operation -- I allude to the Republican's espousal of the ""little giant."" By the way, there is a singular misnomer in the titles of both the journals alluded to -- the Democrat being the Republicans' organ, and the Republican that of the Democrats; hence a stranger is likely to be very prettily mystified and confused between names and principles. Among the names proposed for the opposition nag, against the favorite of Charleston course, are several ""good men, and true,"" such as EVERETT, of Massachusetts, BATES, of Missouri, and BELL, of Tennessee, but you will probably agree that the chance of a nomination for either, alongside of the favorite of New-York, grows daily ""small by degrees and beautifully less."" It would indeed be a fortunate and happy day for the country were the conservative counsels of the people to succeed in placing the ""Washingtonian"" EVERETT at the post of immortal honor and high responsibility, and so have said many in my hearing, since his name was proposed, but I feel the popular appetite will require higher seasoned food, even at the risk of a long fit of indigestion, or even a twinge or two of the gout itself.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM MISSOURI.; The Dead-Lock--Edward Everett--Edward Bates--John Bell--Dull Times--Terrapins and Cruenettas--""No Honor Among Thieves.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM MISSOURI.; The Dead-Lock--Edward Everett--Edward Bates--John Bell--Dull Times--Terrapins and Cruenettas--""No Honor Among Thieves.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Missouri', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'Correspondence of the New-York Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3222bb9d-a2c6-54fd-9031-5bb7100cbd21,988,nyt://article/3222bb9d-a2c6-54fd-9031-5bb7100cbd21,

The intelligence is of interest. The reported resumption of the scheme of a Congress appears to have had origin in the visit of Lord COWLEY to London. Lord COWLEY was, it seems, the bearer of a proposition from the French Government, to the effect that England should join in a circular addressed to the Courts of Europe, insisting upon non-intervention in the affairs of Central Italy, and making intervention a casus belli. The principle was accepted by the English Cabinet, with a reserve of the belligerent alternative, the sanction of Parliament being necessary to authorize a step involving among its consequences a declaration of war. In the absence of this clause the idea of a diplomatic communication was relin-quiushed, and that of a General Congress resumed. This state of affairs is regarded by the London Times as eminently auspicious for the cause of Italy; while the Paris Pays declares the situation. to be entirely satisfactory, and even intimates that the Pope is willing to make the desired concessions. On the other hand, there are indications of indisposition on the part of Austria to abandon the cause of the expatriated Dukes -- a temper that may yet cause trouble. There is nothing of striking moment from the Continent.

"Joseph Townsend, one of the persons arrested for an attempted murder in Fiftieth-street on Friday evening last, was yesterday released by Justice QUACKENBUSH, on $7,000 bail, his accomplice, Jno. Noe, having been previously released on $3,000 bail. Mr. Green, the victim of the murderous assault, still lies very low, but it is thought that his wounds will not prove fatal. As the facts relative to the affray have been very meagerly, and, in some respects, erroneously reported, we have been requested to give the following statement of the affair, as sworn to before Justice QUACKENBUSH, at Jefferson Market Police Court. Mr. Edward Hammond arrived in this City from Westchester County on Friday morning, and stopped at the residence of his brother, No. 22 West Fiftieth-street, near Eighth avenue. During Friday he met his wife -- with whom he has had some difficulty, and who now resides in this City -- in the street, and, after talking with her a short time, they separated. About 9 o'clock in the evening, while sitting in the house of his brother, Mr. Jno. Green, an acquaintance being also present, a boy rang the bell, and inquired if Mr. Edw. Hammonn was in. On being answered in the affirmative, he said that his brother-in-law was at a public-house in the Eighth-avenue, and wished to see him. Mr. Hammond immediately started for the place designated, but had not gone more than three doors from the house when he was assaulted by two men, one of whom seized him by the throat while the other drew a knife and attempted to stab him in the breast. The knife penetrated through his coat and vest and just grazed the skin. He wrested himself from the grasp of the ruffians and ran, crying ""murder"" at the top of his voice. His brother and Mr. Green, hearing the cry, came out of the house, when they were immediately attacked by the two men. Mr. Hammond soon got the better of his antagonist, but Mr. Green was not so fortunate, and during the contest he received three dangerous slabs in the body. Policemen soon arrived, and took the ruffians into custody, who turned out to be Joseph Tounsend and Jno. Noe, both of whom were acquaintances of Edward Hammond, and the latter of whom had been more or less mixed up with his difficulty with ms wife. They are both residents of the east side of the town, near First-avenue. There can be no doubt that this was a deliberate and cold-blooded attempt to assassinate Mr. Hammond, and that Mr. Green, the sufferer from the plot, was not the victim intended.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/03/archives/police-reports-the-attempted-murder-in-fiftiethstreet-attempt-to.html,,"Joseph Townsend, one of the persons arrested for an attempted murder in Fiftieth-street on Friday evening last, was yesterday released by Justice QUACKENBUSH, on $7,000 bail, his accomplice, Jno.

At 11 o'clock to-day Prof. JOHNSON continued his subject commenced yesterday. The points on which he discoursed this morning are ""The Proximate Organic Principles of the Plant -- Cellulose. Starch, Dextrine, Sugar, Gluten, Albumen, Casein, Vegetable Oils and Acids."" Water composes a large share of the vegetable kingdom, amounting sometimes, as in the case of turnips, to ninety per cent. Water is not chemically combined with the plant, but is mechanically held there. It can be driven off by heat, leaving the chemical constituents of the plant by themselves. These remains are subdivided into organic elements, or those which are the result of organized life, and inorganic or mineral. The former are also divided into carbo-hydrates, albumenoids, oils and acids. Some of these names are high-sounding, but they are necessary to the proper classification of substances. The carbo-hydrates, comprising the first four named, and a few others, are composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Cellulose, starch, inulin and dextrine, are precisely alike in their chemical constitution, though widely different in appearance and function. Cellulose -- known also as woody fibre -- is the staple of all plants; it is, speaking generally, the wood of the plant. It can be extracted, as in the case of paper, this article being almost pure cellulose; is insoluble in water, but is soluble to a certain degree in the stomachs of the herbivorous animals. Man could make but little use of the woody fibre of hay, though the ox manages to extract some nutriment therefrom. Starch exists in the cells of all plants, and is obtained by breaking these cells and washing. It is, though insoluble in nature, readily digested by the fluids of the stomach. Its presence in any body can readily be told by an application of iodine, this substance turning it to a bluish purple, which no other substance will do. Inulin exists in many vegetables, and is abundant in the Jerusalem artichoke, thereby making this vegetable an excellent article for the farmer. Dextrine is the substance known in the shops as British Gum. Mucilage and gum also belong to the organic elements; the former being seen in the jelly of seeds, and the latter often seen exuding from the tree. It seems to be a sort of excrement, or something which the plant has no further use for. There are three kinds of sugars: the cane, being the products of the cane, the maple, the beet and other plants, and distinguished from the other two by crystalizing; the fruit and the grape sugars are slightly different in their composition from the cane, and are not found in a solid state.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AGRICULTURE AT YALE.; Prof. Johnson on the Organic Principles of Plants--Dr. Fitch on the Hossian Fly and Wheat Midge.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AGRICULTURE AT YALE.; Prof. Johnson on the Organic Principles of Plants--Dr. Fitch on the Hossian Fly and Wheat Midge.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'AGRICULTURE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From Our Own Correspondent', 'person': [{'firstname': 'From', 'middlename': 'Our', 'lastname': 'Own', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/79a8cb76-9616-5443-9d85-853aa499dab0,1198,nyt://article/79a8cb76-9616-5443-9d85-853aa499dab0,

Men women and children could be seen, by the spectators on the sidewalk, clustered at the windows, screaming for assistance, and wringing their hands in the agony of their despair. Some of them mustered courage enough to jump from the windows, and escaped with slight injuries. The fire-bells quickly gave the alarm for the Fifth District, and the firemen repaired to the spot. Ladders were immediately elevated to the windows, but the longest of them could not reach above the fourth floor. The firemen rescued some of the occupants, but were obliged to abandon all hope of saving the poor creatures in the two upper stories, and it is supposed that they all perished.

Even those who might have been expected to find in the cup a flavor of bitterness profess to see in it something wherewith to sweeten the draught. The Republicans, of course, having won the nominal victory and its immediate fruits, in the shape of offices and profit, can well afford to be contented, though it has been a sore trial to their pride to take down the flag under which some of their loudest leaders had declared that they would march to victory or death. The Democrats congratulate themselves that they have defeated the election of Mr. SHERMAN, though the recollection is dashed with a mild regret that, in order to accomplish this end, they had to cast their entire vote for a man outside of their own party organization. The Americans plume themselves upon having held the balance of power, and boast that the decisive vote which turned the scales in favor of the present incumbent of the Chair was cast by one of their own number. The Anti-Lecompton Democrats lay the flattering unction to their souls that they have administered a tremendous rebuke to the present Administration, and indulge the hope that, though the first prize in the lottery of Congressional organization has not fallen to them, they will assuredly draw the second. And the country, whose feelings and interests have been least consulted in the strife, rejoices, most of all, that the House, after six weeks' tedious manufacture of political capital and a great deal of superflous talk, has at length been organized by the election of a worthy and conservative Speaker, and daringly hopes that the business of the nation will now be attended to, and sectional agitation give place to practical legislation. All parties have had something to do with the result, either by their votes or their influence, by their suffering or their strength. So close has been the contest, that every man who voted for Mr. PENNINGTON may have his sense of individual importance increased by the reflection that his single vote, as Mr. BRIGGS declared of his own in the House, elected the Speaker, and everyone who voted against Mr. PENNINGTON may be relieved by appropriating to himself almost as decisive an influence in the defeat of Mr. SHERMAN.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Happy Family.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Happy Family.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e3a32f4f-477e-526a-8d77-c45b179f007e,828,nyt://article/e3a32f4f-477e-526a-8d77-c45b179f007e,

The latest and most decisive evidence of this is his recent proposition to the British Government for securing the rights of the Italian people and obviating the necessity of a Congress. One of the objects of Lord COWLEY's visit to London, according to the intelligence just received by the America, was to sound the feelings of that Government, on the part of NAPOLEON, touching the advisability of the French and English Cabinets addressing a collective note to the various European Powers, in which it should be declared that any infraction of the principle of non-intervention would be regarded by said Cabinets as a casus belli. Now here was an excellent opportunity for England and her Government to get rid of that Congress to which they look forward with so much apprehension, it being evident that no such assembly would be needed to deliberate on Italian affairs if the Western Powers should agree to cut the gordian knot by thus boldly assuming the championship and protectorate of Italy and her people. If, then, the British Government are in reality so alarmed lest England should be caught in the meshes of that dreaded Congress, why did they not assent to the bold and wise proposition made to them by LOUIS NAPOLEON through their own representative? Why did they not at once agree to become parties to such a note? Why hesitate? why decline to accept for their country the glorious office of protectress of liberty? Could they not appreciate the merits of the policy proposed? Could they not perceive that by its adoption the Italian question would be instantly set at rest?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""England's Alternative."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""England's Alternative."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e3e0f5b-1ebb-58ec-9f84-5a47cb39a883,636,nyt://article/3e3e0f5b-1ebb-58ec-9f84-5a47cb39a883,

Cords were stretched across the street, to prevent interference with the work of removing the ruins. The search for the bodies supposed to have been buried beneath them commenced at an early hour, under the superintendence of the Police. Mr. CARPENTER employed twenty live laborers to assist. About 5 o'clock the body of a woman and child, charred almost beyond the power of recognition, was discovered in the front part of the building, near the door of the bakery. The intense heat which prevailed it was thought, would so completely destroy the bodies that it would be impossible to discover them. Few of the unfortunate tenants who escaped were able to return to view the wreck of their former home; most of them either being injured in their efforts to escape from the building, or were scattered in different parts of the City, endeavoring to provide, as best they might, for their families. Nothing whatever was saved by the sufferers, except the scanty clothing they had on when the alarm was given. Many of the children were in bed, and were carried thence into the street. The severity of the season greatly aggravates the disaster of these poor people, who must be dependent upon the kindness of neighbors or friends for temporary shelter. The actual loss of life, we are happy to state, has been exaggerated, if the accounts thus far obtained are reliable, and probably does not exceed nine or ten.

Our readers may remember that when all Italy rose in arms against the Austrians in 1848, and called on PIUS IX., as the leader in Italian reform, to join in the movement, he refused, on the express ground that he was priest as well as prince; that the Austrians were therefore his children as well as the Italians, and that, consequently, he could not assail them with carnal weapons. On this same ground he expressly proclaimed his neutrality at the outbreak of the war last Summer. Soon after the Austrians evacuated Ancona, the Papal legate followed their example, and the Romagna was left in the hands of her own people. She made common cause with the Allies, set up a popular government, and the flower of the young men poured into Sardinia, and swelled the ranks of the volunteer levies. All this time the Pope and ANTONELLI were praying and protesting. Their souls were filled with grief at what was going on; the shock of arms disturbed their devout meditations, but their duty was clear. They were men of peace -- their kingdom was not of this world, and they could only offer up their supplications for the restoration of harmony and tranquillity amongst the nations of the earth.

The news is more than ordinarily interesting. The Emperor NAPOLEON has announced by a letter addressed to M. FOULD his desire to substitute a system of approximate Free-Trade for the narrow protective principle which has heretofore governed French commercial intercourse; and intimates his design to inaugurate the new economical era as early as may be consistent with agricultural development. At the same time, the fact of a commercial treaty of reciprocity between France and England having been negotiated is affirmed; so that the relations of the two countries, it is understood, will be relieved at once of excessive restrictions. The change has been productive of general satisfaction both in France and England. By these arrivals we are also furnished with a remarkable letter addressed by the French Emperor to the Pope. In it he deplores the state of affairs in Central Italy, ascribing it by no indirect implication to the unwillingness of his Holiness to adopt reforms demanded by the condition of the people, and pointing out the only alternative which the actual position of affairs seems to present. It consists in the abandonment of the Romagna, upon condition, to be guaranteed by the Great Powers, of undisturbed property in the remaining States. With what reception this decisive measure met, we are not informed. From Sardinia we have word that the Ratazzi ministry has resigned, and that Count CAVOUR has been summoned to form a new cabinet. It is uncertain whether he will prove successful; but the presumption is that with the aid of the King, and the now openly-acknowledged sympathy of NAPOLEON III., he will be able to surround and sustain himself with the proper political forces. Rumors of new and confidential arrangements between Austria and Russia are rife, but lack confirmation and probability. In England, all parties were preparing for the opening of Parliament, and for the discussion of the Ministerial Reform bill immediately after the opening. The several meetings of the shareholders of the Great Eastern resulted in a vote adverse to the Board of Directors; and the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry. Renewed offers from Mr. LEVER had been rejected.

Mrs. LUCY STONE went through the long list of female wrongs with her usual ardor and ability, but confined herself in the main to the consideration of the legal impediments to woman's full enjoyment of her property. It was left to Mr. BEECHER to say whatever there is to be said in vindication of woman's right to vote, and the subject certainly did not suffer in his hands. About women's right to the full possession and enjoyment of their property, there is now so little question amongst those who have given the subject any consideration whatever, and the obstacles which prevent it, in this State at least, are now so few in number, that we may promise Mrs. STONE, as far as this portion of her case is concerned, an early and an easy victory. But when we are asked to give the elective franchise to every adult female, as a right, we are under the painful necessity of commencing the discussion by denying that anybody, either man or woman, has any abstract right whatever to vote at elections. Who shall have a vote, and in what manner he shall exercise it, are questions, not of right, but of expediency, which society has to decide, not so as to please everybody, but so as to secure its own happiness and safety. When this object is best accomplised by excluding anybody from the exercise of the suffrage, it excludes them without compunction or remorse. Manhood suffrage is established by law in this State, not because every man is believed to have a right to vote, but because every man's voting, or being allowed to vote, is considered the best means of securing tranquillity, order and good government. This is the only theory upon which the exclusion of negroes, resident aliens, and persons under twenty-one years of age, is for a moment justifiable. We deny them the suffrage, simply because we think, whether rightly or wrongly, that the rest of the community will be benefited by their privation. Moreover, no one contests the right of the majority of the people of the State to meet in convention to-morrow, and amend the Constitution by affixing a condition to the exercise of the franchise, either in the shape of a property or an education qualification, that would cut off a fourth of those who now vote. All this goes to show that women have no more abstract right to take part in elections than any other class of the community. Sex is a distinction of which the Constitution may take notice with quite as much justice as age, or color, or place of birth. The point on which the advocates of woman's rights have to satisfy us is, whether the State of New-York would be made happier, richer, or more prosperous or tranquil, by the addition of two or three hundred thousand females, as females now are, to the list of voters.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Impracticable Rights.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Impracticable Rights.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'STONE, LUCY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Beecher, Henry Ward', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Women', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/46286b20-96e2-5fc3-8c0f-34a5e4885147,713,nyt://article/46286b20-96e2-5fc3-8c0f-34a5e4885147,

Mrs. JOSEPHINE HENSKEL, a favorite danseuse, whose professional denomination was Mile. JOSEPHINE LOUISETTE, was announced to terminate the night's amusements by a rope ascension from the stage to the gallery. She was a pupil of Mons. DE LAVE, the noted rope-walker, and first made this ascension on Thursday last, at the Volksgarten, on the occasion of that gentleman's benefit. On Saturday night, having again successfully accomplished the feat, she was in the act of stepping from the cross-tree, to which the end of the rope was attached, to the stage, when the gauze dress which she wore came in contact with one of the foot-lights and was immediately in a blaze. The excitement among the audience was intense. The husband of the unfortunate woman, who was a musician in the orchestra, leapt upon the stage, followed by other musicians, and, aided by employes of the theatre, who rushed from the rear of the scenes, endeavored to extinguish the flames. In her fright, the sufferer rushed wildly about, funning them into fiercer action by the draft, and in this way every vestige of clothing was destroyed. She was promptly removed to her residence, No. 85 Forsyth-street, and attended by doctors, but her injuries were of such a serious nature that she lingered only till 9 o'clock yesterday morning, when she died. The unfortunate woman was but recently married. She was born in Livingston County, New-York, in 1837, and took to the stage, as a profession, on the death of her father, that she might not only support herself, but furnish assistance to her mother, and educate her brother and sister. She has had engagements, as a ballet dancer, at Laura Keene's and Niblo's Garden. Her mother had always objected to her performing on the rope, fearing that some evil would be the result. This apprehension, which had often been expressed, was recalled to the mind of the sufferer upon the occurrence of this fatal casualty, for almost the last words she uttered were, ""Mother, I would not have gone on the rope, but I wanted to make money for you and the children.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CORONERS' INQUESTS.; Shocking Accident at the Volksgarten.

"The details of the dreadful loss of the clipper ship Flora Temple, Capt.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/06/archives/the-ship-flora-temple-shipwreck-and-loss-of-eight-hundred-and-fifth.html,,"The Flora Temple was a first class ship, and having been chartered for the conveyance of coolies, sailed from Macao on the morning of the 8th of last October. Her crew, including officers, were about 50 men, and four days after leaving port they encountered a heavy gale of wind from the south-west, and Capt. JOHNSON declined making more sail, being apprehensive that a current might set the ship to the eastward, in the direction of reefs which were marked upon the chart. The sights obtained at noon were good, and the position of the ship appeared to be so far (36 miles) to the westward of the most westerly reefs in the latitude in which they then were, that the captain, having directed a good look-out to be kept, apprehended no danger from standing on until 8 P.M., at which hour he had given instructions that the vessel should be put about. At 7:20 P.M. he came on deck, from the tea-table, and in answer to inquiry, was informed by the officer of the watch that a good look-out had been kept from the topsail-yard. The officer was sent forward to see, however, and had barely reached the forecastle, when the cry of ""Hard up"" was heard from the look-out. The helm was immediately put hard up, and the spanker lowered, and no sooner was this done, than ""Hard down"" was heard from the officer, who by this time had come aft again to the gangway. It was then discovered that the ship was within a short distance of the breakers, which could now be distinctly seen and heard, and which extended in a curved line from about four points on the starboard bow to about three points on the port bow. It seemed impossible a long ship like the Flora Tempte could escape them, and although the yards were braced round, and the ship hove aback, she struck first slightly, and then very soon afterwards several times with a tremendous crash, the breakers running very high alongside. Pieces of her timber and planking floated up on her port side, and after some more very heavy bumps she remained apparently immovable, with a heavy list to port, and the water rapidly increasing till it reached between the decks, where the coolies were.

After hearing evidence as to the circumstances of the fire, the efforts of the inmates to escape, and the construction of the building, a verdict censuring the proprietor was rendered. Attached to it was a recommendation to the Legislature, asking the enactment of a statute prescribing means of escape for the occupants of similar structures in case of fire. No other bodies were found yesterday. One of those recovered on Sunday, and taken to the Fourteenth Precinct Station-house, was yesterday identified by means of a gold chain around the neck as the remains of Mrs. CASPAR STORCH, who, with her three children, perished.

KNAPP and SKINNER, his spiritual advisers in his last moments, appears from their statement to have no other or better foundation than his own assertion at the foot of the gallows. The value of such testimony, unluckily, is seriously diminished by the notorious fact that but a small percentage of criminals executed for murder have ever avowed their guilt through convicted on evidence of the clearest kind. Moreover some of the most unquestionable criminals of history have been amongst the most remarkable for religious fervor, as soon as all hope was gone. In what manner they arrange matters between their consciences and their protestations, we must leave to a higher than human judgment to determine. The mental operations by which a murderer justifies himself in his own eyes, are, no doubt, somewhat complicated, and not easily to be explained or understood by the rest of mankind. One motive is generally supposed, and probably with reason, to influence them powerfully, and that is, affection for surviving relatives. If a flat denial of his guilt can relieve a murderer's kinsmen from any portion of their heavy burden of disgrace and grief, it is not surprising that even a murderer should seek to open for them this last and feeble source of comfort. what effect STEPHENS' interest in his little daughter may have had in producing his somewhat ostentatious declaration in the jail yard, it is impossible for any man to say. That it had a great deal to do with it, and that he relied, as people of his stamp are apt to rely, upon the effect of rapid repentance at the supreme moment to atone for whatever guilt this final falsehood might involve, the criminal records of all countries furnish us with ample grounds for presuming.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Stephens as a Martyr.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Stephens as a Martyr.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4293c5e-797c-55e4-9807-60e39806d3f5,914,nyt://article/f4293c5e-797c-55e4-9807-60e39806d3f5,

""From whence are to come the elements of a more perfect Union than the one formed by the men of the Revolution?

Governor HOUSTON also argues that if the Union is dissolved, the border States will suffer the most terrible consequences of dissolution, while South Carolina, ""with the sea upon one side, and a cordon of Slave States between her and danger,"" would have comparatively little cause of apprehension from the assaults of Abolitionism; and that, therefore, the States which are really most aggrieved while in the Union, and which are destined to act as buffers after disunion, between the Abolitionists and the Palmetto Kingdom, should be allowed first to propose so desperate a remedy for existing evils. After quoting from WASHINGTON, JEFFERSON, MADISON, JACKSON, and other distinguished men of the Republic, in deprecation of any attempt, for any cause, to destroy the unity of the Government, and in denial of the right of peaceable secession, the soldier-statesman concludes with recommending ""the adoption of resolutions dissenting from the assertion of the abstract right of secession, and refusing to send deputies for any present existing cause, and urging upon the people of all the States, North and South, the necessity of cultivating brotherly feeling, of observing justice and attending to their own affairs.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Texas at Home.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Texas at Home.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Texas', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2013775f-58da-564b-b94f-c1cffdbca923,622,nyt://article/2013775f-58da-564b-b94f-c1cffdbca923,

Soden then admitted that Cole and himself were guilty, and said that the harness had been sold to Thomas Cogan, the keeper of a junk-shop, fifty cents, and that he had agreed to pay them just as liberally for any goods they might sell to him. Cogan was sent for, and finally confessed to having purchased the harness, which was found in a cellar where he had concealed it. All the prisoners were taken before Justice QUACKENBUSH. The boys were held for burglary, and Mr. Cogan, being unable to furnish $1,000 bail, was committed for trial as a receiver of stolen goods.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; ENCOURAGING YOUTHFUL ENTERPRISE.

PARDEE, of New-York City, gave his first lecture this afternoon on the Strawberry. He came, he said, to speak of facts, not theories. He had tried to grow strawberries for many years by high culture, but without success. He determined to experiment till he should discover the cause of the failure. He had done so, and could now grow them as cheaply as potatoes. The following, according to his experience, is the best method: Select a warm, moist, but exposed situation; for early berries, let it slope to the East or South; for late ones, to the North. The soil should be a fine, gravelly loam. Avoid high, barren soils, and those which are wet. To prepare the soil, make it clean; underdrain, leaving the drain open at both ends to allow the circulation of air. Pulverize at least two feet in depth, making 10 per cent, of the soil as fine as superfine flour. For manures, apply 30 bushels of unleached ashes and 12 bushels of lime slacked with water holding 3 bushels of salt in solution to the acre. Transplanting should be done with great care, and the rootlets of the plant injured as little as possible. The best time to transplant is in the Spring, though with care it may be done any time during the Summer. The lecturer said he would, in starting a new bed, place the plants three feet apart each way, and allow them to spread till they were only twelve inches from each other. Nearer than this they should never grow. The beds should be mulched with tan bark, straw or some such material to the depth of half an inch, no more. This keeps down weeds and keeps all but the strongest runners from taking root. Water may be added with great advantage in large quantities, except during the flowering and ripening periods, provided always it does not stand and become stagnant on the soil. After this preparation little attention is needed. The hoe should never be used about the plants, as it injures the roots. Field culture differs little from garden culture. The productiveness of the strawberry about New-York does not average more than 40 bushels to the acre. There is no difficulty in raising 150 bushels under the cultivation he recommended. In the Winter the plants should be lightly covered.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR. PARDEE ON THE STRAWBERRY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MR.

Not having seen the previous article referred to, I propose to make a few comments upon the positions claimed to be established by this. From the legal distinction between an act malum in se, and one malum prohibitum, I do not propose to dissent. That a distinction exists somewhere between that offence which intuitively suggests itself as a wrong against the conscience, and that which experience and reason only prove to be productive of evil results, there can be no question; but it does not follow that, when ascertained, the one may not be as strictly a wrong to be suppressed as the other. In fact, the dividing line is not so distinct as might be supposed, nor would the division be, to all minds, alike. To o[???] highly conscientious many wrongs would be organized under the first class, which to one less so would fall into the second. So that it is not true that there is a certain class of offences to be thus distinguished capable of a well-defined, obvious boundary. Gambling has come be almost a universally conceded vice, and to many would be an obvious offence against conscience, while to others it would clearly arrange itself among the offences known only as malum prohibitum. Instances might be multiplied, and I think I am not going too far in classing Slavery as one of those offences clearly occupying that debateable ground. But it matters not under which of these divisions it be placed, if essentially an offence. Whether so ascertained by conscience or reason, and whether it is such offence, is really the question to be discussed; for if an offence, it should be discouraged -- if not, it should be encouraged.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SLAVERY QUESTION.; A Reply to the Argument of Mr. George Wood.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SLAVERY QUESTION.; A Reply to the Argument of Mr. George Wood.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'To the Editor of the New-York Times:', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a72ca49a-83bc-5caf-acf4-69cca90d5b8d,1354,nyt://article/a72ca49a-83bc-5caf-acf4-69cca90d5b8d,

It is possible that some new and curious features in our national politics may then be presented. A full and free debate on the Mexican question will perhaps show that our Southern statesmen, either from stronger instincts of State-craft or superior knowledge, have for years completely outwitted their Northern cotemporaries. We venture to assert that in the development of the opinions and policy of leading Southern Senators -- such as Mason, HUNTER, TOOMBS and DAVIS, who are following out the line of policy inaugurated by Mr. CALHOUN -- it will be found that the Federal Government has been under the control of men who well understand the resources and capacity of Mexico, the true characteristics of her people, the nature and quality of peon labor, and the absolute impossibility of introducing negro slavery into that Republic. While the filibustering rabble of the South has ever been ready to throw itself upon Mexico, in the belief that the peculiar institution could be planted there, leading Southern statesmen, beginning with CALHOUN, have understood the matter better, and it can be proved by the record that they have steadfastly opposed the acquisition of Mexican territory, with the knowledge that it must inevitably be settled as free territory, and that all their efforts have been devoted to the extension of Slavery in another direction, and through territories already acquired. Mr. CALHOUN, in 1848, declared that Mexico was �forbidden fruit.� Mr. TOOMBS voted against the appropriation for the purchase of California, in the belief that it must come into the Union as a Free State. The South had complete and quiet possession of Mexico in 1848. They had their own man, Mr. POLK, for President, and they held the Federal Government by a large majority. Our Army was withdrawn from Mexico, and the country was abandoned, because leading Southern men who had control knew it would prove �forbidden fruit,� so far as Southern Slavery was concerned. Had Mr. POLK and his advisers believed that the institution of Slavery could have been planted in Mexico, that country, or the greater part at least, would have been retained by is in 1848.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mexican Treaty in Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mexican Treaty in Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eb92e713-46a2-5a32-ae9b-dedf2e5434db,1131,nyt://article/eb92e713-46a2-5a32-ae9b-dedf2e5434db,

"The veto of the bill for deepening the channel over the St. Clair flats is another instance of that deliberate disregard of the popular will and that bland indifference to the great interests of the country, for which the present Administration has been preeminently distinguished.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/09/archives/the-presidents-flat-veto.html,,"The veto of the bill for deepening the channel over the St. Clair flats is another instance of that deliberate disregard of the popular will and that bland indifference to the great interests of the country, for which the present Administration has been preeminently distinguished. But, then, Mr. BUCHANAN has constitutional scruples to signing the bill, and this fact ends the discussion. The President has the right to have his scruples; it is an especial guaranty of the Constitution which provides that if he does not approve a bill presented to him for signature, he shall return it with his objections to the House in which it originated. And not only does he possess this right; its exercise is a great convenience when no other objection can be found to an act of legislation. It is so easy to have scruples when they fall in with the current of one's prejudices and feelings. The Constitution, which at one time is so elastic as to comprehend all sorts of doubtful powers of government, at another time be comes so rigid that it can hardly be made to embrace the vital and essential interests of the country. Mr. BUCHANAN has found it much easier to obey these scruples than to give reasons for their existence which shall even seem to be logical and consistent enough to prove satisfactory to the country -- at least, we judge so from the perusal of the veto message which he has sent in to the Senate. This message throws no new light upon the question, and it will scarcely increase its author's reputation as a statesman. Its only effect, we apprehend, will be, in certain States, to add poignancy to the regret, bitter enough already, that their electoral votes were cast for the present incumbent of the Presidential chair. Mr. BUCHANAN would scarcely have received those votes if the people of these States could have anticipated that he would use the power with which they have entrusted him to thwart their wishes and to strike a blow at their prosperity.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The President's Flat Veto."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The President's Flat Veto."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/945c690c-7c7f-54f3-a2d5-1d5f45027d81,1504,nyt://article/945c690c-7c7f-54f3-a2d5-1d5f45027d81,

The all-important question asked is: Where can the market-men be accommodated while the new market is in progress? Already the neighboring sidewalks, and, for the greater portion of the day, the principal part of the roadway, are occupied by the demands of the vast traffic in the necessaries of life. There is no place in the vicinity capable of affording sufficient room, while to take the trade away altogether would be an almost insufferable inconvenience. So far as giving greater facilities for the transaction of business is concerned, the market-men claim that as many stands as possible are at present accommodated. The only benefit, therefore, it is claimed, will be the improved appearance of the market.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/09/archives/city-intelligence.html,,"TROW'S NEW PRINTING OFFICE.--The new and splendid five-story and basement brick building, with fire-proof front vaults, erected on lots Nos. 40, 48 and 50 Greene-street, between Grand and Broome streets, and one block from Broadway and Canal-street-the best and most central location in this City--has been leased for a term of years by JOHN F. TROW, Esq., the celebrated book and job printer of Directory celebrity, and for many years established -- one of the oldest houses in this City -- who will remove on or before the 1st of May next his immense establishment from Nos. 377 and 379 Broadway to this superior building, which, has been erected under the direction and superintendence of GRIFFITH THOMAS, Esq., the celebrated architect of this City, and no expense has been spared to make it what it really is, one of the finest and most substantial buildings in this City, with steam power attached. The foundations are of the best blue quarry stone, and not less than 12 inches in thickness. Foundation walls are 24 inches thick, of blue stone, and laid in cement. The principal front is Philadelphia brick, with heavy brown-stone coping, sills, courses, &c., &c. The rear and side walls are of selected North River brick. The rear brick wall is 2 feet 4 inches thick up to second story beams, all other walls are 16 inches in thickness. MARC EDLIZ, the enterprising mason, has given this job his special attention, and one has only to look at this splendid building to become satisfied that all is well done, and of the best material. The immense quantity of timber in this building was ordered from the Calais Mills, and cut expressly for this job. The beams are 4 inches by 12 inches, and 16 inches from centres. The girders are in two lengths, 10x12 inches and only twenty feet apart, resting upon two rows of columns, fourteen on each floor, iron in basement and yellow pine on first, second, third, fourth, and fifth floors. The girders are doweled with heavy iron dowels running through, and resting on iron caps and bases. The front windows are arched and of the French style, six on each story, with nine in rear, making some twenty-one windows on each floor, which has over 5 000 feet, and lighted on all sides. That all is of the very best material, and done in the most workmanlike manner, and strictly within the Fire Laws, it is only necessary to add that JAMES L. MILLER is the master carpenter. The first-story front is iron, with seven massive iron columns, iron lintel course, sills, &c., &c. There are six openings, two leading up stairs, two to the first floor, and the others are two immense windows, filling the entire space. Heavy iron shutters on rear and sides. There are two very heavy iron lintel-courses running across the entire rear, making, with the massive brick walls, one of the strongest and safest buildings in this City. The building and all throughout has been strongly fastened and anchored, and all the iron is of the very best material, and done in the most workmanlike and strongest manner, as the books of MICHAEL GROSZ will bear testimony, as he furnished all in the iron department. A superior steam engine, 18-inch cylinder and 4-foot stroke, with cut off and every improvement, is being made and put up by FALCONER & THOMPSON, who guarantee it shall be every way superior. There will be two boilers, two 16-inch flues in each, 30 by 30, and 48 in diameter, made by SAMUEL SECOR, from the very best material, selected with great care, and warranted a most perfect and safe job. They will be placed in the rear, and entirely distinct from main building, furnace-room, chimney, &c., &c., all being in the rear, and made fire-proof. The building will be healed with steam-pipes running around on the walls; some four thousand feet of pipe is required for same. There will be a steam hoist, and every improvement, as no expense has been spared in its erection, or will be in its completion, making it one of the finest and safest buildings in this City.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f00f7f32-a8b5-53df-8f71-456c58cf377e,1331,nyt://article/f00f7f32-a8b5-53df-8f71-456c58cf377e,

The force of a concentrated Southern opinion has compelled the Republican members of the House to abandon their candidate, and for the sake of conciliating an outside support from members not of their party, to centre upon a man whose title to election is that he is not personally identified with Mr. SHERMAN in this particular, that his name is not found in the first degree as recommending the Helper call for insurrection, but only in the second degree, as in the ranks of those who support it with explanations and qualifications, who confess that there is something in it to be disavowed, for the sake of peace. The election of PENNINGTON, therefore, as the defeat of SHERMAN, is worth something, as the sign that the Republicans, when most united, may be compelled, in the lace of an outspoken public opinion, to change their tactics, if not their principles, and to give back before the determined will of the South.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLITICAL.; Election of Speaker.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'POLITICAL.; Election of Speaker.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4f6bd9d-2a17-50fa-a5ee-542e96850983,1071,nyt://article/f4f6bd9d-2a17-50fa-a5ee-542e96850983,

He has already provoked a great clamor of hostility at Washington by his appointments to the Standing Committees of the House. The State of Texas, in the persons of her two Representatives, has utterly refused to accept the position assigned to her -- Mr. REAGAN and Mr. HAMILTON declaring that they ""could be of no earthly service to their constituents"" -- the one in the Committee on Private Land Claims and the other in the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions. We must admit that there is a certain show of reason in this. Mr. HAMILTON was one of the most prominent candidates for the seat which Mr. PENNINGTON now fills, and might, therefore, fairly have expected some special consideration at the hands of his successful competitor; while it can hardly be supposed that Texas contains any very enormous number of Revolutionary Pensioners. Mr. BOCOCK, of Virginia, too, has been rather too emphatically shelved in the Committee on Naval Affairs, and several other leading men of the Democratic party have fared no better with Mr. PENNINGTON than the Republican leaders usually have both in the Senate and in the House whenever they have been compelled to accept the law from their political conquerors. On the other hand, we can recall no instance in which, under any Democratic organization of either House, the conspicuous men of the opposition have been on the whole so handsomely dealt with as have the antagonists of Mr. PENNINGTON by the new Speaker. Mr. GILMER, of North Carolina has the Chairmanship of the Committee on Elections; Mr. ETHERIDGE, of Tennessee, the Chairmanship of the Committee on Indian Affairs. Mr. SMITH, of North Carolina -- SMITH, not of the egg-nogg, but of the slip ""'twixt cup and lip,"" -- appears in the important Committee on Commerce. Mr. MILLSON of Virginia, and Mr. PHELPS of Missouri, are in the Committee on Ways and Means. In the Committee on Territories, where, if anywhere, an intense partisan spirit might have been expected to triumph absolutely, only one -- decidedly prominent Republican (Mr. GROW) has been named to rule over Mr. SMITH of Virginia, Mr. VALLANDIGHAM of Ohio, and Mr. CLARK of Missouri, the Knight who rode down the Republican standard-bearer, Mr. SHERMAN, in the long conflict just terminated. The Committee on Foreign Affairs is very evenly balanced between the Ins and the Outs: and, on the whole, we do not see that there is any reason for denying to Mr. PENNINGTON the praise of a more than ordinary impartiality in the distribution of legislative honors and duties.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The House Organizing.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The House Organizing.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d046a80-4ac2-50ae-9041-b2c1044e32a0,438,nyt://article/2d046a80-4ac2-50ae-9041-b2c1044e32a0,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/10/archives/the-pope-and-his-subjects.html,,"The Roman correspondent of the London Times, writing on the 14th ust., says: It is supposed, and very rationally, as it seems to me, that French protection will go so far as to secure for the Pope the possession of Rome and of its immediate territory -- but will go no further. For the rest the Pope must rely upon his own means, both to guard himself against his own subjects and to ward off the attacks of the emancipated Romagnese. Now the Pope's own means at the present day, I have positively ascertained, do not extend beyond 5,500 men stationed at Pesaro, 1,700 men quartered at Urbine, and the scanty garrison at Ancona, besides the 1,500 men who still do jailer and hangman's work at Perugia. The fine Dragoon regiments which paraded so gallantly the streets of Rome last Carnival are reduced to about 200 horsemen, 90 of whom are at Pesaro; the rest are still lodged in their barracks near the Vatican. By way of compensation the gendarmes are very numerous; handsome men, finely appointed, and, whatever may be said of their moral character, to be relied on both for courage and loyalty. The other native troops are worthless rabble; the Swiss are riotous and mutinous, and between all these and the new Austrian and South German recruits there is very bad blood -- soldiers' quarrels are events of daily occurrence at Pesaro. All these particulars may be safely depended on. Now, supposing that the French Emperor abides by his semi-official pamphlet and official articles; supposing that his intimation goes forth with sufficient clearness that beyond Rome and its Campagna the French troops will not be used as the Pope's soldiers -- that beyond the personal security of the Pontiff he does not choose to be instrumental in staying the national Italian movement -- what chances are there that the Pope may, I will not say recover what he has lost, but even retain what he still holds? Let it be under-stood where the French mean to draw the line beyond which they will not pass, and we may hear of out-breaks at Orvieto, at Viterbo, at Macerata, wherever the scanty forces of the Pope cannot muster is sufficient masses to overawe the multitude, -- even supposing that bands of Tuscans and Romagnese, who have depots of arms at various points on the borders, do not, as soon as they are not forbidden by France, begin to scour the country, directing their attacks against those disheartened and discordant Papal hire-lings, who hardly need an onset to break up and go asunder.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pope and His Subjects.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pope and His Subjects.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3bcfc55c-404f-5f92-bef9-502e43656c0a,433,nyt://article/3bcfc55c-404f-5f92-bef9-502e43656c0a,

The act of 1848 was the first inroad upon the old common law doctrine which vested the ownership of everything that a woman possessed at the time of her marriage, or which she afterwards acquired either by gift or bequest, or purchase or labor, in her husband's hands. Under that rule a woman's only mode of saving whatever she might own at her wedding, from passing at once to her husband and becoming liable for his debts, was by a special deed of settlement; and that is the only means to which women in England, as well as in many States of the Union, can resort at this moment to secure themselves against the pecuniary risks of wedded bliss. In New-York, what a single woman posesses at her marriage now remains her own after her marriage, and whatever she subsequently acquires, by gift or devise, comes under the same category. But by a strange anomaly the act of 1848 did nothing to secure her in the possession of the earnings of her labor, though the women who are obliged to labor are unquestionably those who stand in greatest need of legal protection, and though a woman's acquisitions made in that way are more indisputably and decidedly her own than any others whatever. A drunken, idle or vagabond husband might regularly despoil a most industrious wife of the fruits of her toil -- might seize and retain her weekly wages, and leave herself and their children destitute, and she had no redress. True, if anybody left her a legacy, or made her a present, she might keep it, and bid the conjugal spoiler defiance; but the women who have worthless husbands, and have to work hard for a living, are rarely blest with bilious uncles from India, or old bachelor cousins delighting in Christmas generosity. The reform in the law, therefore, though it certainly was a reform, and a great one, did little for that class of women which the common law doctrine most sorely oppressed. That twelve years should have elapsed between the first move towards the emancipation of women and the bill now before the Legislature, is a singular illustration of the slowness with which a legal change, when it interferes seriously with social prejudices, is always brought about. The abolition of the Court of Chancery was accomplished in far less time than it has taken to secure a poor washerwoman in the enjoyment of the fruits of her own toil, and protection from the most cruel of robberies.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Female Emancipation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Female Emancipation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Women', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Marriages', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76dd1d1f-2e0a-596c-9257-734c9a3aa998,1463,nyt://article/76dd1d1f-2e0a-596c-9257-734c9a3aa998,

Lecture, introductory to a a course on Criminal Jurisprudence in America previous to the Revolution, was delivered last evening to the Students of the Law Department of Columbia College, in No. 37 Lafayetteplace, by WM. CURTIS NOYES. After some prefatory remarks, he observed that, for a thorough comprehension of the subject, it was necessary to acquire a perfect knowledge of the code of laws of the mother country, because these laws were virtually the laws adopted by the Colonists. In illustration of this he cited the cases of the Trinity and Dutch Churches. He alluded, en passant, to the witch trials in New-England, (of which so much has been written and said,) by way of showing the inconsistency of the administration of the laws at the time when those cases occurred, and gave additional interest to his remarks by the introduction of numerous ludicrous jokes. He narrated the variations in the practice of the several Courts established in this country, while still subject to British rule, and showed how they were influenced by the introduction of Dutch laws, customs, and usages. The origin of the old saying, that ""when the rope breaks, the criminal is free,"" (which is an error still very prevalent among the ignorant,) he accounted for by referring to an old Dutch law which provided, that in the event of the breaking of the rope no attempt should be made at repairing or replacing it until another criminal should be adjudged to undergo the punishment of which the rope is the instrument. He concluded by exhibiting the popular advantages which accrued to this State, when, having been subjected to the English by conquest from the Dutch, it acquired the right to trial by Jury.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/10/archives/mr-pardee-on-the-raspberry.html,,"At 2 o'clock this afternoon Mr. PARDEE continued his lectures on the small fruits. The raspberry was spoken of first. Few persons, he said, had ever seen a first-rate one. The gardeners about our cities do not know how to grow it in perfection. This fruit likes a moist, cool situation, such as the north slope of a hill or the north side of a fence. The soil should be made very rich; you cannot overfeed the raspberry. The strawberry has a multitude of fine fibrous roots, and as it grows little woody fibre, it requires little manure; the raspberry, on the contrary, produces considerable wood, and as it has few fibrous roots with which to take up nourishment, these should be well supplied. The soil should be made very fine. Plant about four feet apart, and cut the canes to within one foot of the ground. At the time of planting, stake with strong stakes. Those which will last forever may be made by the French burnettizing process, which is as follows: soak the stakes six or seven days in a solution of blue vitriol and water, in the proportion of one pound of vitriol to twenty pounds of water. Berries raised on canes which have been carefully tied to stakes are much finer than those which have been left to be blown about by the wind. As soon as the raspberries have all ripened, remove the wood on which they grew and allow the sap to flow into the new canes, which will bear another year. Keep the ground clean.

As long as the war between Republican and Democrat was carried on from opposite sides of the House, and the members of the contending factions were not brought into close proximity, there was always a chance for friends to interfere before enraged antagonists closed in combat, and the mere distance which separated them, small as it was, exercised its usual influence in mollifying animosities. But even this pacific influence, we all know, did not furnish a complete guarantee against the occurrence of a fight. There were few of us who would at any time have been surprised at seeing an announcement that one of the ballots for Speaker had been preceded by a lively ""set-to"" with the naked fists, followed up by a dropping fire of small arms. Considering that all the Southern members professed to see in the Republican members one hundred and sixteen conspirators for the assassination of themselves, their wives and families, and the kindling of a servile war, the wonder is that they ever kept their hands off them so studiously. The manner in which several Southern gentlemen showed them up, contained plenty of charges which ordinary human nature would light upon as a complete justification of the most dreadful scattering of wigs, hurling of spittoons, kicking and cuffing, that ever occurred on the floor of a Legislative Assembly. Mr. CLARK, of Missouri, in particular, if he believed one-half what he said, is deserving of the highest commendation for refraining from making a desperate attempt on JOHN SHERMAN's life; and how it is that a person of Mr. KEITT's political views and clearness of intellect, could have been guilty of anything so illogical as not plunging a bowie-knife into somebody's abdomen, we confess we are at a loss to conceive.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Chances of Committees.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Chances of Committees.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6be2b4ca-7a78-5840-9442-2bcbe61606d8,588,nyt://article/6be2b4ca-7a78-5840-9442-2bcbe61606d8,

And we are glad, therefore, to see that a meeting has been called, to be held in this City on some day of next week, for the purpose of expressing the unfeigned admiration which the manly and sensible attitude preserved by the Italians throughout this great crisis of their national destiny has excited in the hearts of free and intelligent men all the world over. America must have sympathized in any event with a great people struggling to assert its natural place among the nations; and had the conduct of the people of Central Italy been marked, as it might well have been expected that it would be, by all the excesses so common in the history of outraged races rising for their rights, we should still have felt for them and with them in their supreme hour, and hoped even against hope, that liberty would bring them law at last. But we have not been forced to make any allowances for the past, in commending the present of the Italian State, The men who but yesterday were the chasing subjects of the Austrian sword, for years the only real sceptre of the Peninsula, have approved themselves at once the free citizens of a free commonwealth. In the records of the great year 1859, the one mad outbreak in which the cruel ANVITI expiated with his life an atrocious career of years among the people of Parma, will be more than balanced by the brutal sack of Perugia in the name of order and the Vicar of Christ. And it will be set down in the chronicles, that while the revolutionists of Parma did sure and speedy justice upon the lawless executioners of a despot's minion, the Holy Father honored with the crosses of the Church the mercenaries who had put a fair city to pillage and to rapine beneath the banner of St. Peter.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Italian Cause.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Italian Cause.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b3c2c379-d871-5f7b-9b57-b2a425f00637,601,nyt://article/b3c2c379-d871-5f7b-9b57-b2a425f00637,

It originated under the Commonwealth -- becoming part of the law of the land in 1660, during the Parliamentary session of which year a proviso was added to the Post-office bill of Col. TITUS, which exempted the letters of members of Parliament from postage while attending to their public duties. The proviso met with very hard usage in passing through the House. One honorable gentleman called it ""a poor mendicant proviso;"" the Speaker, when putting it from the Chair, declared that ""he was ashamed of it;"" nevertheless, the majority supported it, and, the lords ratifying their decision, the ""poor mendicant proviso"" remained in the bill, and grew in time to be so popular that the friends of honorable members and noble Peers, as well as honorable members and noble Peers themselves, freely took the benefit of it; may, gradually learned to apply it to purposes which were certainly never contemplated by its author. The term ""letters"" in those days had a more comprehensive meaning than is now assigned to it, being equally applied to what we call ""letters,"" and to ""parcels."" Of this comprehensiveness British Senators were not slow to take advantage, and thus the franking privilege in England soon became the source of abuses to which our comparatively modern system can furnish no parallel. Not only were dresses, boots, shoes, window-curtains, lace, books, partridges and pheasants regularly transmitted through the British Post-office under cover of this privilege, but even haunches of venison, entire bucks and packs of hounds! To put a stop to these abuses, an act was passed in the middle of the last century restricting the number of ""letters"" which members of Parliament could frank to ten a day, and fixing the limits of their size and weight. Said act did not, however, apply to members of the Government, who were still allowed to exercise the privilege ad libitum; so that even in the present century GEORGE CANNING, by virtue of this exemption, could send a whole copy of CLARENDON's History, free of postage, to a friend in Ireland, and Mr. POULETT THOMPSON, afterwards Lord SYDENHAM, three haunches of venison to his constituents at Dover!",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Franking Abuse in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Franking Abuse in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Postal Service', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12db7d03-7756-5e7d-958a-3b34b54625e7,724,nyt://article/12db7d03-7756-5e7d-958a-3b34b54625e7,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/13/archives/papal-obstinacy.html,,"Pro NoNo has given another epistle to the Press--an address to the Archbishops and Bishops of France explanatory of the motives which led him to refuse the advice of the Emperor touching the Romagna. The"" motivas"" of His Holiness, being of the old stereotyped cast, require no consideration, but the address is of importance as indicating that the Pope is still obstinately determined not to accept the terms of compromise offered him in the ingeniously respectful letter of NAPOLEON. The hereditary maxim of the Ultra-Montanists, ""Sit ut est, aut non sit,"" is still the maxim of PIUS. Change is the great immutable law to which all things in the material and immaterial universe are subject; nevertheless this infatuated old man and his satellites impiously rebel against their Maker's ordinance, and proclaim their treason in the face of earth and Heaven. The Pope will not give up the Romagna! But who asks him to give up the Romagna? The Emperor of the French was hardly so unreasonable as to ask his Holiness to surrender what he does not possess. The French Sovereign merely urged him, for the sake of Europe, of Italy, and of the Church, to accept accomplished facts. The conduct of his own Government has hopelessly alienated the people of the Papal States. He is simply, therefore, called upon to bow to the popular will, in his capacity of temporal Prince. Will his American Bishops dare to contend that this demand is exorbitant? The Pope assumes that it is, and clings to his sterile royal right to reconquer the Romagna, and the Emperor NAPOLEON has never questioned his right to achieve even this un-Christian enterprise, if he could achieve it with his own forces His Holiness is at perfect liberty, so far as NAPOLEON and France and Europe are concerned, to march his mercenaries as soon as he pleases into the revolted provinces, and bring about their reduction. But in accepting the undertaking he must accept the consequences. Should he enter upon this campaign and fail to accomplish his purpose -- as fail, undoubtedly, he would -- he must not think of repairing his fortunes by means of foreign auxiliaries. He must not look either to the South or to the North, neither to the despot of Naples, nor to the despot of Austria for succor. For their assistance, even if they had the temerity to give it, could serve no other purpose than to consummate his ruin. Were the Neapolitan monarch to march to his aid, VICTOR EMANUEL, of Sardinia, would at once enter the arena as the ally of the Romagnoli. Were the Austrian autocrat to espouse his cause, the French Emperor would again take the field as the champion of Italy, would of course withdraw his garrison at once from Rome and leave the stubborn and intractable Pontiff to his fate. Whether then is it better for Pro NONO to accept the compromise offered to him by NAPOLEON, and to secure by doing so the future possession, perhaps, of his cis-Apennine provinces -- certainly of the world's respect -- or to enter on a course which must entail the most lamentable disasters on the country which he professes to rule in the name of Christ, and lead to the utter destruction at least of his temporal and very possibly of his spiritual power also? Every intelligent Catholic must see that it would be madness in the Pontiff even to think, in his present circumstances, of attempting the reconquest of the Legations; and that the very best thing he can now do, as well for his own interests as for those of the church, is to accept the offer of the French Emperor, abandon a right which he has lost the power to enforce, and avoid while it is yet time a collision of which no man, not an ""Archbishop or Suffragan of the Province of New-York,"" will rashly attempt to prophesy the long and terrible results.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Papal Obstinacy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Papal Obstinacy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/20571110-40b9-5133-bef8-a878c045e466,816,nyt://article/20571110-40b9-5133-bef8-a878c045e466,

In the way of brief and hasty resume, we may mention that WEBER's ""Freischutz,"" -- ever an unwelcome work with the American public, -- was given on Friday to a house mainly composed of Germans. A great deal of excellent commendation has at various times been bestowed on this work and so far as relates to orchestration, and occasional choral morceaux, not undeservedly. It is remarkable in some of these respects. But the vitality of an opera depends simply and purely on its adaptability to the voice of singers, and on a sufficiency of purely vocal themes. Here and there in ""Der Freischutz"" are admirable bits of singable condescension, but the bulk of the music is vocally impossible; a collection of passages that degenerate naturally into screams, and, however well executed, provoke uneasiness. For these reasons -- and for the additional one that it is difficult to decide which are the dullest, the original German dialogues which connect the pieces, or the intermediate recitatives of HECTOR BERLIOZ, which leave them centuries apart -- the opera enjoys but little popularity out of Germany. All the leading artists on Friday were good, COLSON, STIGELLI and JUNCA.

It was enough for them to know that Jack Frost had again asserted his supremacy. The elevation of the ball at the Central Park Observatory was sufficient inducement to draw to the Skating Pond crowds of schoolboys, and those of larger growth, who were glad enough of the opportunity to enjoy a half holiday. Ladies, too, found it necessary to indulge in more violent exercise than a quiet promenade along Broadway, in order to counterbalance the sudden transition from Spring to Winter. As the thermometer went down, every one who could went up to Central Park, and a merry time there was until late in the evening, when the darkness put an end to the sport. Despite the fact that yesterday was the Sabbath, the Pond was again thronged. To be sure, there was a change in the complexion of the crowd. Boys who had parents to keep them at home, wickedly wished that the Sabbath might have been postponed for another day. But they had to reconcile themselves to attending Sabbath School and Church, while those whom the necessity of daily labor deprive of any other holiday, took their places at the Pond. The cars on the Third and Sixth avenues were thronged, and, as heretofore, those who could not get seats or standing-room inside these vehicles, were obliged to suffer their fingers to become benumed by hanging on wherever they could find the space. How long the thermometer may labor under the depressing influences from which it suffers at present it is impossible to predict; but the Winter is nearly gone, and. it is hardly probable that the ice will be as firm and glassy again as it is at present.

The costs of proceeding for the recovery of such sums in the Justices' Courts at present, form an enormous percentage on the debt even if its recovery were certain. A dollar has to be paid at the ontset for a summons, and then the unfortunate plaintiff has to sacrifice his time, which, in most cases, means his daily bread, dancing attendance at Court until the cause is reached. If he is so lucky as to be able to prove his case, or get a judgment, he is three dollars out of pocket before the constable proceeds to levy, and then he may find at the close that there is nothing that can be levied on. The servant may, for instance, have been hired by the husband, and have served the whole family faithfully, and yet may find, on taking out execution, that the whole property is vested in the lady, who, of course, is not liable for her husband's debts.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Servants' Suits."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Servants' Suits."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97165839-8369-5311-bd1d-5b3a37748488,337,nyt://article/97165839-8369-5311-bd1d-5b3a37748488,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/14/archives/the-franking-abuse.html,,"The feeling of the House of Representatives indicates that the Senate amendment to the Post-office Appropriation bill, abolishing the franking privilege, will be rejected. The plea put forward is, not that the abuse of this privilege, by which the mails are flooded with worthless matter, to the detriment of the regular service, and at an immense expense to the country, should not be corrected, but that a radical change in the system should be introduced in a separate bill, and thoroughly discussed and matured. We cannot see the force of this argument. That a reform is needed is generally conceded, and if this be so, the form of legislation by which it is to be effected really seems to be of very secondary consequence. It will be easy enough to alter any of the details of the proposed system as its practical working may show to be expedient. The great end to be gained is to put a stop, in the quickest practicable way, to a costly and growing evil. Besides, the whole subject lies in a nutshell, and may be comprehended, even by an average member of Congress, in all its bearings, with but little reflection. It cannot require much deliberation for any man to make up his mind upon the simple question whether the country shall pay the enormous cost of supplying individuals with information upon all conceivable topics -- information too which, in most cases, is of but little value in itself, and that little not made available to the persons for whom it is provided. The newspapers of the day contain everything of interest in all the departments of popular information about public affairs, and they are full to overflowing with the merely partisan political matter which is now circulated under the frank of members of Congress. Newspapers have become a necessity to the reading community, and no rational creature can think of supplying their place by public documents, which lack their freshness, their variety, and their comprehensiveness.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Franking Abuse.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Franking Abuse.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b0a5eeb-20c0-57b5-b94b-70e3dadc6235,486,nyt://article/2b0a5eeb-20c0-57b5-b94b-70e3dadc6235,
"Shortly alter our going to press on Saturday morning a most disastrous fire occurred n the building occupied as a saw and planing mill situate on the wharf, foot of Shackamaxon-street, and used and occupied by the Messrs.

The building was filled with lumber and other combustible material, and the flames raged with great fury, spreading to the boat-yard and sheds of GEORGE SHEPPERD adjoining, and consuming a considerable amount of lumber and several small skiffs, boats, &c., some of which belonged to other parties.

TUERS, the Custom-house watchman, who was murdered in Statestreet on Friday night, has not yet been solved. An investigation of the matter was commenced yesterday by Coroner JACKMAN, and a number of witnesses were examined, none of whom however, testified to anything tending to point out the perpetrator of this brutal murder. The proceedings were conducted in the Seventh Precinct Station-house, and the interest which the case excites was manifested by the attendance of a numerous audience. On Sunday night, SARAH J. MCCLESTER, a young married woman, residing at No. 176 East Twenty-eighth-street, was apprehended on the supposition that she was the person who had been seen in company with the deceased a few minutes before his death. JOSIAH MCGARR, a stage-driver on the Fourth-avenue line, testified positively to the identity of this woman with one who rode in his stage from the corner of Whitehall and Front-streets about the time the murder is supposed to have been committed. The woman and her husband, however, just as positively deny that she was out of the house at all on the night in question, except to visit a friend, and that she returned home before nine o'clock. Mrs. MCCLESTER was nevertheless detained until the matter should be further investigated, as her character, from the representations of other witnesses, is such that her veracity may be impeached. The testimony of Dr. CHARLES MARSH, the family physician of deceased who was present at the post-mortem examination conflicts with that of the other physicians as to the manner in which the blow was struck which resulted in Mr. TUERS' death. Dr. MARSH is of opinion that the injuries to the face were inflicted with a set of ""metallic knuckles,"" a formidable instrument, usually carried by highwaymen, made to fit the fingers of the right hand, and that the injury to the back part of the head was the result of the fall. Drs. BEACH and WETJE are said to entertain views upon the point directly the reverse of these. The funeral of Mr. TUERS took place yesterday, from his late residence, No. 243 Monroe-street. It was numerously attended, not only on account of the extraordinary circumstances connected with his death, but as a testimony of respect to his memory by those to whom he was well known.

"In the House of Commons on the 27th ult., Mr. M. MILNES said his noble friend at the head of the Foreign-office would not be surprised at his rising to ask what effect had been given to the address of this House presented to her Majesty on the 2d of August last, with respect to cases of violence and cruelty committed on board of American ships engaged in the traffic between this country and the United States. The picture, he regretted to say, had since been considerably darkened, and acts of gross and cruel murder had been added to the catalogue of crimes. A few days after the address was presented occurred the case of the sailor ANTONIO, who died in the hospital at Liverpool. Upon the inquest a solicitor appeared on the part of the American Government, denying altogether the jurisdiction of the Court, and saying, not without acuteness, ""That it was an American transaction on board an American ship, and with which no one but Americans had anything to do. If they had killed the man then and there the case might have been one of murder or manslaughter within American jurisdiction; but, as he had died at Liverpool in consequence of injuries inflicted in the course of the voyage, the jury could bring in no other verdict than 'Found dead.'"" And that was the result of the inquest. He would not trouble the House with a recital of these frequent occurrences, but there was one which occurred only on the 14th of January last. Two American mates of the bark Anna were brought before the magistrates of the Isle of Wight, charged with having put to death, under circumstances of-great cruelty and violence, no less than six sailors between America and England, or one-half the whole crew. A gentleman, who represented himself as the agent of the American Government, appeared and put in question the jurisdiction of the Bench. He claimed that the mates were American subjects, and that if they had committed any offence it was upon the high seas, or more than a league from the British coast. The magistrates had been blamed, and he thought unjustly, for having discharged to sailors. It was wrong to say that they were guilty of the horrible crimes charged against them, but it was a very significant fact that a smile passed over their faces when the non-jurisdiction of the Court was established. There was no doubt that the impunity attending such grave crimes was telling mort detrimentally upon our own merchant service. In a case of great violence the other day, it was given in evidence that the captain said: ""How I regret I am under English law! If I were under American law I could do anything I chose to my men."" The American Chamber of Commerce at Liverpool had represented the matter as strongly as possible to their fellow-counter men at home. Great interest was felt upon the subject in America, and no doubt the American Government would cooperate with the English Government in trying to find a remedy for a grave and growing evil.

The facts are as follows: Two brothers, named RILYEA, with a friend, all residing at Esopus. Ulster County, were sailing in an ice-boat on the river on Saturday afternoon. After amusing themselves for sometime, they fastened the boat to the dock at Port Ewen, and went into a tavern to drink. While there, three Irishmen took possession of the boat, loosed it from the dock, and sailed to the middle of the river, where they were observed by one of the brothers, who instantly went to them and demanded the boat. The Irishmen refused to surrender it, and angry words ensued. During the altercation, young RILYEA unfastened the tiller and threatened to drive out the occupants of the boat. Upon this, one of the Irishmen drew a knife from his pocket and stabbed the unfortunate youth in the heart, inflicting a fatal wound. The remaining brother and his friend witnessed the transaction from the shore, and immediately started for the scene of the affray. Before they arrived at the boat, however, they came to the place where the elder RILYEA lay, and seeing that he was dying, rushed towards the boat to take revenge. After a short fight, one of the Irishmen seized the titter and struck the friend of the brother a severe blow upon the head, which felled him senseless. HIRAM RILYEA then repaired to the tavern where he procured a pistol, and returning to the boat shot one of the Irishmen, killing him instantly. He then turned and ran for the shore in the direstion of Rondout, followed by the remaining Irishmen, where he arrived in advance of them, and instantly gave himself up to the authorities. The brothers RILYEA were 20 and 22 years of age respectively. The one who was killed was buried on Sunday. Both the offenders have been arrested.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bloody Affray on the Ice at Port Ewen.; TWO MEN KILLED, ONE FATALLY WOUNDED, AND ANOTHER BADLY HURT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bloody Affray on the Ice at Port Ewen.; TWO MEN KILLED, ONE FATALLY WOUNDED, AND ANOTHER BADLY HURT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2a072e2-8d9f-5ed9-b57b-d9e3589a0ec5,416,nyt://article/d2a072e2-8d9f-5ed9-b57b-d9e3589a0ec5,

During its continuance, one Mary Stewart, a white woman, was so severely beaten that she was rendered insensible, in which condition she remained until her death resulted in consequence of the injuries she had sustained. The police knew nothing of the affray until Tuesday evening, as the parties interested have endeavored to keep it secret. As soon as Capt. Hutchings was informed of it he dispatched Officer Fields to inquire into the circumstances, and, yesterday, he arrested Ephraim Huso, Enoch Folks, James Griffiths, negroes, and Ann Styles, a white woman, on suspicion of having been engaged in the fight.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/16/archives/the-anglogallic-treaty-of-commerce.html,,"Commerce is beyond question the most powerful bond of peace that can unite nations together. The case of England and America illustrates the truth of this assertion. The business connections and necessities of these two countries are stronger guarantees for the continuance of amicable relations between them than even those sacred ties of blood, religion and language which eloquent gentlemen are so fond of invoking after public dinners, when the wine is in and the wit comes freely out. Since the war of 1812, our commercial intercourse has become so intimate, our commercial interests so intermingled and amalgamated, that war between us seems all but impossible, and, should it ever arise, would prove almost equally disastrous to both of the infatuated belligerents. The conviction of this truth sinks yearly deeper into the public mind on each side of the Atlantic; and hence the nervous anxiety shown by the Governments and citizens of our respective Empires to settle San Juan disputes and naval outrages, even faster than a busy Press or hair-brained officers can create them. It is but fair, therefore, to the Emperor of the French to assume that his new economical policy has originated as much in his desire of binding France and England to each other by the ties of reciprocal interest, as in his avowed motive of developing the resources, fostering the industry, and swelling the opulence of the people committed to his care. That NAPOLEON, in initiating his commercial programme, had the former not less than the latter object in view, is, indeed, conclusively demonstrated by his own conduct. Hardly had his letter to M. FOULD, on the principles of free trade as the basis of public policy, been given to the world, than its indefatigable author hastened to put himself into communication with Lord COWLEY touching the provisions of a new treaty of commerce between England and France -- a treaty which should open the ports and markets of both countries to the staple productions and manufactures of each, and prepare the way for the annihilation of all those restrictive enactments which have inflicted so many positive injuries on the industry of each, in return for very questionable advantages, and have educated their inhabitants to a perpetual forgetfulness of their own great stake in the preservation of peace. The moment the Emperor had exchanged views with the British Ambassador, and agreed with him as to the terms of the contemplated treaty, he urged that functionary to proceed immediately to London, and submit these terms to the consideration of his own Government. Lord COWLEY did as he had been requested; and the Foreign Secretary and Premier having approved of the instrument, their representative repaired once more to Paris, and, on the 23d ult., signed on the part of his sovereign a treaty, which, if fairly carried out, will prove in the future a source of innumerable blessings both to France and to England.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anglo-Gallic Treaty of Commerce.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anglo-Gallic Treaty of Commerce.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ea2a807-52b2-5ad0-ab0c-c9b2f669896c,1579,nyt://article/9ea2a807-52b2-5ad0-ab0c-c9b2f669896c,

COLLINS, a prominent Whig and Republican politician, who was found lying in Thirteenth-street insensible on Monday morning last, died at the New-York Hospital on Tuesday night. Coroner GAMBLE investigated the circumstances of his death yesterday afternoon. It appeared from the evidence that deceased went in a carriage to the public house on the corner of Hudson and Barrow streets about 12 o'clock on Sunday night. At that time he was under the influence of liquor, but persisted in taking several additional drinks, and in about three-quarters of an hour he left, as he said, to go up town. When he was assisted to the carriage the driver was privately notified by the proprietor of the saloon to convey Mr. COLLINS to his own residence. This request, the driver testifies, he attempted to comply with, but on opening the carriage door on arriving in Lispenard-street, where deceased lived, he discovered his vehicle to be empty, and the opposite door open. It is supposed that Mr. COLLINS, discovering that he was traveling in a direction contrary to that which he desired, jumped out of the vehicle without the driver's knowledge, and thus received the injuries which resulted in his death. That he was discovered so far up town in so short a time after leaving the public house in Hudson-street, is only accounted for by the supposition that he rode up in a car after leaving the carriage. A post mortem examination resulted in showing that death had been produced by compression of the brain, caused by a fracture of the skull. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the facts, and recommended that measures be taken to provide medical attendance at the Station houses for persons confined while in a condition similar to that in which deceased was when brought in.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; UNTIMELY END OF A POLITICIAN.

Various amendments were offered, but the, determination of Senators was evident either to have total abolition or nothing. The fate of the bill in the House is regarded at Washington as doubtful. The members of the House stand in a more intimate relation to their constituents than do the Senators, and they are more open to influences which would be likely to operate against the proposed reform. Elected directly by the people, and for a shorter term, they will naturally be more anxious to enjoy the facilities of communication which the privilege affords with those whom they represent, that they may thus increase the chances of reelection. It is to be hoped, however, that they will be willing to give the system of universal payment of postage a fair trial. We are satisfied that after a session's experience of relief from the drudgery of the everlasting franking of documents and of correspondence with everybody who thinks he has something of interest to communicate to ""our member,"" or who has business with the Departments, that he would on no account be willing to saddle himself with a burden which prevents his giving proper attention to his legislative duties, and seriously interferes with his comfort and convenience. We regard the abolition of the frank as even more important in this view of it than as a measure of economy to the country; while it will establish in practice the only correct principle of requiring those to pay for the benefits of the mail service who receive them, and in the proportion in which they are received.

Mr. HICKMAN, not at all in debate on the floor of the House, but simply on his private responsibility, made a speech from a hotel-window at Washington to a crowd rejoicing over the election of Mr. PENNINGTON to the Speakership. In this speech he took occasion to taunt the whole State of Virginia with cowardice, and to caricature the events of the raid at Harper's Ferry in a way singularly offensive both to good taste and good feeling, and widely at variance with the truth. Mr. EDMUNDSON, one of the oldest members of the House from Virginia, it appears read this speech, as reported in the journals, with-natural indignation, and suffered himself to be stung by it into a state of rather superfluous excitement. Meeting Mr. HICKMAN in the Capitol grounds, he gave vent to his feelings after a very semi-civilized fashion, by slashing the offending Pennsylvanian across the face with a small twig, as little like the murderous bludgeon of gutta-percha with which the champion of South Carolina fell upon the unarmed Senator from Massachusetts, as Mr. HICKMAN's reckless post-prandial provocations were like the solemn and measured denunciations of Mr. SUMNER's famous oration.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Manufacturing Martyrs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Manufacturing Martyrs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fcd52fef-0e98-5461-bfc5-10f782857f2e,458,nyt://article/fcd52fef-0e98-5461-bfc5-10f782857f2e,

A meeting of the master bakers of this City, Brooklyn and Williamsburgh, numbering about two hundred, met at No. 160 Heater-street, last evening, the object, as defined by the call, being ""to adopt measures of selfprotection against the system of monopoly inaugurated by Mr. JOHN HECKER."" It appears that in consequence of large capital, and more extensive faculties, Mr. HECKER has been enabled to place the smaller bakers at a disadvantage in the size of the loaf which he sells, and in other ways to injure the business of the bakers. Being a manufacturer of flour, and, at the same time, carrying on the baking business, with agencies in almost every part of the City, the effect is damaging to the smaller capitalists, who have hard work to earn a living for their families. They state that Mr. HECKER places, his flour in the market with a Variety of brands, by which they are unable to distinguish it from any other flour, and they are thus often obliged to buy his flour, giving patronage to the man who is doing his best to break them down, and who declares it to be his intention to supply the entire City with his bread. Various plans of resistance were proposed. One, that the bakers should combine, and by going into the market with large capital, be able to purchase flour at as low rates as Mr. HECKER can manufacture or buy it. It was stated that the price now paid by bakers for the best flour was $6 50 per barrel, while at the rate Mr. HECKER sells his bread, it cannot cost him over $4 50 per barrel. It was also proposed that the bakers cease to purchase flour of those de[???]ers who bought Mr. HECKER's flour, and sold it to them under other and fictitious brands. Mr. SWANEY, who said he had been a baker for over thirty years, was in favor of using persuasive measures to obtain a redress of their grievances; and, after they had failed, to adopt the coercive plans proposed. He suggested that a Committee from the bakers be appointed to wait upon Mr. HECKER, and request him to give up his baking business, and confine himself to making flour, which was his legitimate business. During the effort to select this Committee, a proposition was made to adjourn, until they should have further time for consultation. The Chairman was authorized to call another meeting.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CITY INTELLIGENCE.; MEETING OF THE MASTER BAKERS. REHEARSAL OF THE NEW NATIONAL GUARD BAND.

"JAMES, Earl of Southesk, a live lord from Scotland, recently came to this country on a visit, and on a Cunard steamer, and after a tour of pleasure, we believe, and of profit, we trust, reached Jersey City on the Erie Railroad, on his way home, at 12 1/2 P.M. yesterday. As soon as he had alighted from the cars he inquired among a crowd of bystanders at the depot whether the Asia had sailed. He received a response in the affirmative, and a person who -- the Earl says in an affidavit which he afterwards had occasion to make at the Mayor's office -- had the general appearance of a railroad employe, obligingly informed him that he would guide him to an office at which he could learn all that he wanted to know regarding the sailing of all steamers from Portland or from Boston. So they proceeded together to an office on Cedar-street, where his lordship was informed that the Canada, of the Cunard line, would sail from Boston on the 22d inst. The clerk who told him this advised him to take passage in a steamer from Portland, but this the nobleman declined to do. The clerk said he would give him a cabin in the Canada, and told another person in the office to go and reserve a cabin in the Canada by telegraph. Then he called the earl into an ante-room, and asked him to register his name. This done, he was required to pay to another clerk $275 for his own and his servant's passage. He did so, and presently the man who had been sent to telegraph to Boston, returned and reported that it was ""all right."" Then my lord was requested to pay $25 more; there had been a mistake in demanding only $275. The earl demurred; the price was greater than he had paid for a passage from England. That made no difference; it always cost more to go to England than to come from there -- a fact that the swindler in this instance would have realized had be been on British soil. Further, the clerk said there was an extra charge for securing the cabin, and something he said about paying for previsions; he might have charged several dollars more. Finally his lordship paid the extra charge and left the office without looking at the ticket, further than to ascertain that the signature was genuine. Not long after, in examining the ticket he perceived that the amount for which it was a receipt was only $225. Then the light broke upon him. He had been swindled out of $75. He found his way to the Mayor's office, made his affidavit, and an officer was dispatched to the ticket office, who arrested the proprietor, ISAAC SELOVER and brought him before Alderman PECK, the acting Mayor SELOVER stou[???]y denied the charge, but Alderman PECK decided to commit him and refused to take bail.

It was shown that deceased had become involved in a quarrel with a young colored man named ENOS FOULKE, respecting a small amount of money. Finally FOULKE struck the woman on the head with his fists, knocking her down and rendering her insensible. She remained in an unconscious condition from that time until her death. FOULKE acknowledged to EPHRAIM HUSE, the proprietor of the house where the affray occurred, and also to DANIEL WILLIAMS, one of the inmates, that it was he who inflicted the blows, but, supposing the we man would recover, they failed to call the attention of the Police to the matter. Dr. GEORGE B. BOUTON testified that he had made a post-mortem examination of deceased, and found that death resulted from compression of the brain, which had been superinduced by violence. The jury agreed with the Doctor in his opinion, and charged that the blows had been inflicted by FOULKE. The prisoner stated that he was born in Philadelphia, and worked along shore. With reference to the charge, he said that he did not think that he had caused the woman's death. Coroner SCHIRMER committed him to prison to await the action of the Grand Jury, and detained HUSE and WILLIAMS as witnesses. Deceased was a Scotchwoman, about 33 years of age, and formerly gained a livelihood by peddling apples.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; A WOMAN BEATEN TO DEATH.

The following verdict was given: ""That the said DENIS TUBRIDY met with his death by falling over the stone wall on the west side of the Fourth-avenue, between Eighty-sixth and Eighty-seventh streets, upon the railroad track of the New-York and Harlem Railroad Co., on the evening of Monday, the 13th inst., between the hours of 4 and 7 o'clock; we further find that the wall which had been until within eight or ten days sufficiently high to prevent persons falling over upon the railroad track, not having been raised sufficiency high by the Railroad Company, was the immediate cause of the accident which befell the deceased, but whether the deceased was killed by the fall over the wall into the cut, or was killed by the train running over him, the jury are unable to determine. We further find that the New-York and Harlem Railroad Company have been guilty of gross neglect and culpable indifference in not building the wall on the west side of said avenue, after they had pulled the old wall down, of sufficient height as before, which would have, in the judgment of the Jury, prevented this sad accident, and that if the Company or its servants had performed their duty the same accident would not have occurred. We further find, and hereby certify that the condition of the walls between Seventy-ninth and Ninety-second streets have been for a long time, and now are, in a highly dangerous condition, including the bridges; and respectfully but earnestly suggest that the same be laid before the Grand Inquest of the County of New-York for indictment, or such other action as may suggest itself to that honorable body.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; ACCIDENT ON THE HARLEM RAILROAD THE COMPANY CHARGED WITH GROSS NEGLECT."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Coroners' Inquests.; ACCIDENT ON THE HARLEM RAILROAD THE COMPANY CHARGED WITH GROSS NEGLECT."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0e5ad6fb-82ae-5754-8fdd-f342a4fe2994,432,nyt://article/0e5ad6fb-82ae-5754-8fdd-f342a4fe2994,

The capacity of Hope Chapel was by no means sufficient to accommodate the numbers who flocked thither, yesterday morning, to attend the Semi-annual Exhibition of Columbia College; a great many were unable to obtain admission, and it was regretted that the exercises had not taken place in a larger hall. Declamations were delivered by ten students -- two from each of the four classes, and two representing respectively the Peithologian and Philolexian (literary) Societies. The orators were William C. Binns and Almar P. Webster, of the Freshman Class; Charles A. Spencer and Walter Cutting, of the Sophomore Class; Wm. H. Caswell and George Lansing, of the Junior Class; Edward L. Greenwood and Abraham Suydam, of the Senior Class; Langdon Greenwood, of the Peithologian Society, and T.H. Messenger, of the Philolexian Society. The Freshmen and Sophomores spoke selected pieces, and the orations of the Juniors and Seniors were original. That of Mr. CUTTING received the most applause, and to him the first prize was awarded. Messrs. SPENCER and TAYLOR received the prizes of the second best. President KING, in announcing the award, stated that the prizes were given for the best delivery, and the composition of the original orations were not taken into consideration. Why it was not, or why I should not be, he did not explain. He eulogized Mr TAYLOR's effort -- a poem called ""The World's Hope' -- and said that gentleman would have received the first prize if the literary excellence of his production had been thrown into the balance. The President announced the names of the excelling five in each class They were as follows: Seniors, Wm. F. Whitehouse. J.H. Van Amoriage, Robert Goelet, Jr., Egerton L Winthrop and John W. Jenks. Juniors, Frederick C, Whitehouse, William A. Rice, Gratz Nathan, Wm H. Caswell and Elisha Horton, Jr. Sophomores, C. Sigourney Knox, David B. Oliphant, Charles K. Riley, J.N. Vanderpoel and Wm. A. Hegeman. Freshmen, Dan. Marvin, Jr., Henry E. La Combe, Francis L. Newcome, R.C. Hall, and Robert S. Tucker. After the benediction had been pronounced, and while the audience, three-fourths of which wore crinoline, was gradually dispersing, the students, who all the morning had been exceedingly quiet, made the hallway hideous with their cheers for him who had carried off the first prize, and with their groans for a policeman who endeavored to keep them quiet. Afterwards they gathered in the Chapel and vociferously called upon Mr. CUTTING to address them. He complied, thanking them for their expressions of gratification at the honor conferred on him, and concluded by advising them, for the credit of their Alma Mater, to disperse without making any more noise. They acted on the suggestion after a little delay, and thus ended the semi-annual racket match.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; Fires.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; Fires.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b599676-1326-5071-964c-20f421e8cc09,1763,nyt://article/6b599676-1326-5071-964c-20f421e8cc09,

In regard to the rumored acquisition of Savoy and Nice by France it would appear, notwithstanding the tranquillizing assurances of Lord JOHN RUSS$ELL, that the annexation is likely to be speedily effected. The French journals indeed already speak of it as un fait accompli. It is, of course, understood that Piedmont consents to this cession, because of the sacrifices of France in the late Italian campaign, and in view of the compensation anticipated in Central Italy. That the engagement under which the French army was to be placed upon a peace footing is not deceptive, we have evidence in the report of the French Minister of War announcing that the contingent of 1859 will be reduced from 140,000 to 100,000 men. Further details of the late actions in Morocco state that the battle of Jan. 23 was in reality drawn, both armies retaining their positions. In that of Feb. 1, the brother of the Emperor of Morocco commanded the Moors, who were mowed down fearfully by the Spanish artillery. It is now credibly reported that the regular army of the Emperor has not been in action, but has been held in reserve, upon the anticipation that the enemy might be drawn into the interior and then overwhelmed by an unexpected attack. KOSSUTH is said to have gone to Hungary. The Protestant deputation, to whom the Emperor had refused an interview, had published a memorandum indicative of irritated feeling and a hostile purpose. Discontent was so general and menacing that Government was rapidly massing troops on the frontier. In the Grand Duchy of Baden much excitement prevailed in antagonism to the recent concordat. Of the five Commissioners appointed by the Diet to examine the instrument, four are known and one is believed to be opposed to the treaty.

"-- At a recent meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, at which Sir R. MURCHISON presided, a communication from Mr. WHEELWRIGHT was read, for the construction of a railway across the Andes. That gentleman, who is well known for his successful endeavors to establish steam navigation along the western shores of South America, and for several railway projects in Chili, proposes to make a railway from Morro de Copiapo, about 27 degrees of south latitude, on the west coast of South America, to Rosario, on the Rio Plata, a distance of upwards of 1,000 miles, and to cross the Andes at a height of 16,000 feet above the level of the sea. The reading of extracts from other communications by Mr. WHEELWRIGHT prefaced his proposal, for the purpose of describing the other works he had planned and successfully prosecuted, and to show that the engineering difficulties of the proposed railway would, not be so great as those which had been overcome. The pass across the Andes which had been selected for the line, though at an elevation of 2,000 feet greater than some other passes, possesses the great advantage of being never blocked up with snow, and from that point eastwards there is a gradual slope that would present scarcely any difficulty. The descent on the westward of the mountains is, however, so precipitous that extremely severe gradients would in many parts be necessary, and Mr. WHEELWRIGHT spoke of a gradient from San Francisco of 450 feet in a mile.

A place in the Senate is straightway offered to the young man. He takes his seat there; he speaks, when so minded, without party anger or intrigue, but not without party faith and a sort off heroic enthusiasm for his cause. Still he is poet and philosopher even more than orator. That he may have leisure and means to pursue his darling studies, he absents himself for a while, and accepts a richly remunerated post in the East. As learned a man may live in a cottage or a College common-room; but it always seemed to me that ample means and recognized rank were MACAULAY's as of right. Years ago there was a wretched outcry raised because Mr. MACAULAY dated a letter from Windsor Castle, where he was staying. Immortal gods! Was this man not a guest for any palace in the world? or a fit companion for any man or woman in it? I dare say, after Austerlitz, the old K.K. court officials and footmen sneered at NAPOLHON for dating from Schonbrunn. But that miserable ""Windsor Castle"" outcry is an echo out of fast retreating-old-world remembrances.

"This afternoon LEVI BARTLETT, Esq., of New-Hampshire, lectured on the cultivation of Winter wheat in the New-England States, but especially in the State of New-Hampshire. Prior to 1852, most persons, said he, would as soon have thought of growing oranges in that State as wheat. Few persons there had ever seen a wheat field. At that time one of his neighbors visiting New-York was so well pleased with the appearance of the wheat fields that he procured seed and determined to attempt its cultivation. His first crop produced abundantly, and this he disposed of to those of his neighbors who were willing to experiment in its cultivation. Some failed to get any favorable results, but those who cultivated thoroughly and sowed early got from 15 to 20 bushels to the acre. His own experiments for six years have given him an average of 15 bushels, and he had not attempted to grow large crops. His method was to turn over sod and sow it at once; top dress, at the time of sowing, with 150 pounds of guano, 15 bushels of ashes, and one bushel of salt, for each acre; soak the seed before sowing in weak brine for two hours, and roll in ashes; sow the latter part of August or first of September. Late sowing is useless, for the midge will destroy it, but we have no Hessian fly to injure it if early sown. Those varieties which ripen early are best. He had grown the Japan wheat for four years, and found it to succeed well. It ripens early though it is a red wheat, and does not make as fine flour as the white. He thought if Com.

Mr. BARTLETT closed by expressing the opinion that the day was not far distant when New-England would raise nearly all the wheat they would consume, and he urged that her people should take hold of the matter in earnest, and prosecute it thoroughly.

"On the 30th of last October John Brooks, alias W.H. Williams, and Geo. Coffin, alias Geo. Howard, visited Cold County, N.Y., and defrauded nearly all the saloon-keepers in the place with five dollar bills which purported to be issues of the Mechanics' Bank of New Haven; Conn. After having disposed of about one hundred dollars in these bills they went to the railroad depot, expecting to leave town by the next train, but some of their victims discovered the fraud which had been perpetrated upon them, and an alarm having been given by ringing the village bell, the people of the town rushed en masse to the depot, and after a severe struggle succeeded in arresting the culprits. After a summary trial and conviction they were committed to the County Jail at Carmel, where they remained just nine days, when they effected their escape. Brooks was rearrested two days subsequent, charged with having passed more counterfeit money at Bridgeport, Conn., but his friends succeeded in effecting his release. All trace was lost of these enterprising individuals until a fortnight ago, when Sergeant Dickson and Detective Farley observed Brooks in this City and traced him to a house in Delancey-street. On Saturday night they effected his arrest. Information which they received led the officers to suspect that Coffin was frequenting the house No. 102 Cannon-street. On inquiring for him, his wife, who lived there, told them that he would be at home in a few days. During the temporary absence of Sergeant Dickson, about five o'clock yesterday morning, Coffin entered the house, and Detective Farley, who was on watch, followed him, and ordered him to surrender. In reply, Coffin drew a dirk-knife and threatened to stab the officer if he did not withdraw. Although Detective Farley was armed and could have maimed the prisoner with ease, he decided to await the return of Sergeant Dickson, knowing that Coffin could not effect his escape in any other way than by the front door. In about half an hour Dickson made his appearance, and the two officers at once stepped up and attempted to arrest him. Rendered desperate by the apparent impossibility of his escape, Coffin struck at Detective Farley with his knife, and in warding off the blow, the pistol which the officer held in his hand exploded, the ball wounding Coffin over the right temple.

"Upwards of 500,000 workers are now employed in our cotton factories, and it has been estimated that at least 4,000,000 persons in this country are dependent upon the cotton trade for subsistence. A century ago Lancashire contained a population of only 300,000 person; it now numbers 2,300,000. In the same period of time this enormous increase exceeds that on any other equal surface of the globe, and is entirely owing to the development of the cotton trade. In 1856 there were in the United Kingdom 2,210 factories, running 28,000,000 spindles and 293,000 looms, by 97,000 horse power. Since that period a considerble number of new mills have been erected and expensive additions have been made to the spinning and weaving machinery of these previously in existence. The amount of actual capital invested in the cotton trade of this kingdom is estimated to be between &#163;60,000,000 and &#163;70,000,000 sterling. The quantity of cotton imported into this country in 1859 was 1,181 3/4 millions pounds' weight the value of which at [???] per [???] is equal to &#163;30 000,000 sterling. Out of 2,829,110 bales of cotton imported into Great Britain, America has supplied us with 2,086,341, that is 5 7[???] of the whole. In other words, out of every 7 [???]s. imported from all countries into Great Britain, America has supplied 5 lhs., India has sent us about 600,000 bales. Egypt about 100 000, South America, 124,000; and other countries between 8,000 and 9,000 bales. In 1859 the total value of The exports from Great Britain amounted to &#163;130,513,185, of which &#163;47,920,720 consisted of cotton goods and yams. Thus, more than one-third, or &#163;1 out of every &#163;3 of our entire exports, consists of cotton. Add to this the proportion of cotton which forms part of 12 millions more exported in the shape of mixed woolens, haberdashery, millinery, silks, apparel, and slops. Great Britain alone consumes annually 24 millions' worth of cotton goods. Two conclusions therefore, may safely be drawn from the facts and figures now cited -- first, that the interests of every c[???]ion-worker are bound up with a gigantic trade which keeps in motion an enormous mass of capital, and this capital, machinery and labor depend for five-sevenths of its employment upon the slave States of America for prosperity and continuance; secondly, that if a war should at any time breakout between England and America, a general insurrection take place among the slaves, disease sweep off those slaves by death, or the cotton crop fall short in quantity, whether from severe frosts, disease of the plant, or other possible causes -- our mills would be stopped for want of cotton, employers would be ruined, and famine would stalk abroad among the hundreds and thousands of workpeople who are at present fortunately well employed. Calculate the consequences for yourself Imagine a dearth of cotton, and you may picture the horrors of such a calamity from the scenes you may possibly have witnessed when the mills have only run on ""short time.""

When members are deprived of the right of sending political wisdom by the hundred weight gratis through the Post-office, they will probably be able to write their correspondence in their rooms, and be able to listen to what is going on while they sit in the House. The franking privilege may have made desks a necessity; but their presence unquestionably leads to a terrible waste of time. They were the main promoters and supporters of that system of essay-reading which has gradually taken the place of debating in both Houses of Congress. How much they have had to do with the present lamentable condition of parliamentary oratory in Washington, is partially shown in the wide difference which everybody recognizes between the style of public speaking at an ordinary public meeting for business, and that which prevails at the Capitol. When men get up to address audiences at Faneuil Hall or the Cooper Institute, they have either to argue well, or joke well, or be very pathetic, or very sublime. If they are simply long-winded, and insist upon repeating what everybody knows without either wit, or humor, or logic, one of two things is sure to happen -- the audience will stamp them down, or the getters up of public meetings will never ask them to speak again. For the sake of his present comfort, as well as his future reputation, the orator who addresses an ordinary popular assemblage is compelled to employ all his powers in keeping up the attention of those who are present. They are there to be either amused, or convinced, or excited, and while they are perfectiy ready to accept whatever boon he pleases to confer upon them, they insist upon his either amusing, exciting or convincing them. The public meeting is, in short, a barometer by which the extent of every ""spouter's"" powers may be pretty accurately ascertained.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Seats and Speeches in Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Seats and Speeches in Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c955b7df-9edf-58d4-84f8-22f5d6556767,1016,nyt://article/c955b7df-9edf-58d4-84f8-22f5d6556767,

This enactment was made at the very moment that a vast step had been taken in the science of locomotion, but one of which our people, at the time, were unconscious. Its importance is now fully revealed. The canal is no longer the sole, nor is it the most convenient or economical means of moving persons, or many kinds of property. The railroad upon the very route of the Erie canal has taken from it a very large traffic. Upon numerous other routes between the interior and tide water, impracticable for canals, have railroads been constructed, all drawing off a portion of the traffic once enjoyed by our great water line.

Mr. BROWN'S resolution was then taken up, and Hon. DANIEL CLARK, of New-Hampshire, spoke at some length in opposition. Mr. CLARK recounted the annals of Pro-Slavery agitation since 1850, showing that the institution during the past ten years had become daring and aggressive, and prophesying its early extension over the soil of the Free States. Mr. TOOMBS, of Georgia, took occasion from a remark of the Senator to deny that he had ever engaged to call the roll of his slaves in the shadow of Bunker Hill. In conclusion, Mr. CLARK repudiated the idea of the Senator from Mississippi, that Slavery was the keystone of the Federal arch. He pronounced it rather a cobble stone, adding nothing to the strength of the structure, which indeed would be stauncher for its absence. A message from the House announced the death of Hon. WILLIAM O. GOODE, the predecessor of Hon. ROGER A. PRYOR. Messrs. HUNTER and CLAY uttered brief panegyrics upon the deceased, and the Senate adjourned. The Speaker of the House of Representatives announced the special Committee upon the Senate's bill abolishing the franking privilege. It consists of Messrs. Vallandigham, Kellogg, Burnett, Adams of Kentucky, and Stokes. Mr. LOVEJOY, of Illinois, moved a Committee of Inquiry as to the alleged violations of that article of the Constitution which, guarantees the citizens of one State equal rights in another. He was unable to procure a vote on his resolution. Various bills for the support of Executive bureaus were reported from the Committee of Ways and Means. The death of Mr. GOODE, member of the House from Virginia, was announced by Hon. ROGER A. PRYOR, his successor, and after fitting eulogies, the House adjourned.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ea6667c-c5dd-52fd-9531-906d3c03c041,1237,nyt://article/5ea6667c-c5dd-52fd-9531-906d3c03c041,

Two of the public's best appreciated servants Mrs. JOHN WOOD and Mr. JOSEPH JEFFERSON returned to their legitimate quarters at this popular establishment last evening, and, by the force of fun, dispelled the vapors of a chill and particularly cheerless night. It is so long since we have had anything in the shape of downright merriment at a New-York theatre, that the advent of these artists is certainly a circumstance to be rejoiced at. From the time that Mrs. WOOD withdrew from the Winter Garden, the sensation drama, in one shape or other, has had full possession of its respectable stage. Even Mr. JE FERSON, who is by no means of a saturnine and moody disposition, has been compelled, by adverse circumstances, to abstain from making in decorous appeals to the risibility of the audience. It is something that now, under brighter auspices, and in view of a notable reaction in public taste, Mr. STUART has determined to give us a feast of a light and wholesome character, and something more that this feast is presided over by such spirits as Mrs. JOHN WOOD and Mr. JEFFERSON.

The bill recently introduced into the Legislature of New-Jersey, contemplating the sale of all the land lying under water in front of Jersey City, beyond a certain base line, for the benefit of the State, has aroused a deep feeling of opposition to that measure in the people of Jersey City, who met last evening at Commercial Hall for the purpose of protesting against the bill. The meeting, though not large, comprised many large property owners, and some of the most influential public men. A series of resolutions and the form of a memorial were adopted, after some remarks expressive of the views of the meeting. They declared that the bill contemplating the appointment of three Commissioners to dispose at public auction of the lands lying under water within the limits of a base line drawn between Vandervorst-street and Constable's Hook, would be doing great injury to the rights of many citizens as riparian owners; would destroy the fisheries, and seriously affect the interests of navigation, and that they accordingly remonstrate against its passage. They declare that the assumption that the State is the owner of all lands lying under water within the ebb and flow of the tide is erroneous, as shown by the uniform legislation of the State. That the grants to individuals of the right to erect wharves and piers does not confer a grant to the land, but is only leave to extend the structure into the navigable waters belonging to the public; that the State is merely the guardian for the whole community, and must act solely as a trustee of the common property, and that it is in this character only that she can confer grants. The attempt to lay upon Hudson County alone this burden of paying the debt of the State, was denounced as ah odious species of special legislation, which should be opposed to the utmost. Messrs. STOUGHTONBERG, Judge MARSH, E.B. ""WAKEMAN and Hon. E.R.V.

Though often taken before Police magistrates, and committed to the Tombs for examination, he has hitherto, by finesse and address, managed to evade a direct criminal trial. But yesterday, notwithstanding further efforts of his counsel for postponement (and it may here be said, that Ex-Recorder Smith, Ex-Judge Dean and Mr. H.L. Clinton, having been applied to to defend him, refused to do so,) he was confronted with a jury. The special charge, out of many, which was tried, was one of grand larceny, the indictment charging him with obtaining a diamond ring, valued at nearly $200, by fraud, from a patient of his, named Mary Roberts, a lady residing in Broome-street -- the Doctor's office being in Bleecker-street. The lady, it appeared, had been Ellis' patient for some time, and had been cajoled by him into lending him on sundry occasions, sums which in the aggregate amounted to $1,100. In acknowledgment thereof, he had given her notes of hand -- one for $500 on a worthless Pennsylvania Coal Company -- and others, all of which he subsequently obtained from her and destroyed. On Feb. 25, 1858, he ""admired"" a diamond ring on her finger, asked to look at it, and, permission being granted, put it in his pocket, and never thereafter did Miss Roberts lay eyes on it. And that was the specific charge against him yesterday. Miss Roberts testified clearly to this fact, and bore from the counsel who were not ashamed to defend the ""Doctor,"" as those before named had been, a very rigid cross-examination with considerable equanimity.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS; General Sessions.

We proclaim, then, as our belief, that at this day nine-tenths of all the opposition to the Democracy in the Free States are solidly banded together under the Republican organization. And yet those nine-tenths are perfectly satisfied that a union of all the elements of opposition to the Democracy is desirable; and to produce such a union they are willing to make any reasonable concession. We do not doubt for a moment that if the one-tenth to whom we allude should say to the Republican Party in convention, ""Be generous -- act with magnanimity, and give us the Vice-President,"" the response would be favorable; and that Mr. BATES, Mr. BELL, Mr. CRITTENDEN, or any man of that class, could be placed upon the Republican ticket for Vice-President. There are no better men than they in the whole United States -- none for whom we entertain greater respect; and individually, we should rejoice in the nomination of one of them for Vice-President, and believe that the Republican Party would approve of the act. But when the one-tenth of the Opposition, say to us, as they do, ""You must take one of our men as your nominee for the Presidency or we will not act in concert with you;"" our reply is -- Never. Much as we desire Union, we cannot and will not recognize the right of one-tenth to dictate to the nine-tenths; and such we believe is the almost unanimous feeling of the people who compose the Republican Party. We believe this feeling is so general, that the nomination by the Chicago Convention of any man for the Presidency who acted against us in 1856, would inevitably insure the defeat of the Republican Party; and we believe, too, that the nomination of any other person than WILLIAM H. SEWARD, would endanger a similar result. This, also, is the conviction of the Democracy; and to produce such a result, is now admitted to be the only game left them to play with any chance of their success. We have no faith in their political honesty, and still less in their political principles; but we know them to be cunning and wise in all that concerns the action of the masses, and when they arrive at the conclusion that the Republican Party can only be defeated by defeating the nomination of WILLIAM H. SEWARD, and find that decision is in accordance with our own judgment, there exists no longer a doubt in our mind, that if SEWARD be not nominated, the Democratic Party will have a reasonable hope of success.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PRESIDENTIAL QUESTION.; THE NOMINEE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

The Tribune, however, begins by inviting the contingency. It assumes, as already settled, that the Democrats will nominate DOUGLAS, and thus ovade the issue which the selection of WISE, STEPHENS, or any distinctively Southern man would raise; and upon this assumption it proceeds to show that the Republicans cannot hope for success unless they secure the support of other parties. The Courier and Enquirer resents this policy with great show of indignation, and announces its determination to bolt the nomination of any man who did not act, heartily and zealously, with the Republican Party in 1856.

"THE CASE OF ELLA BURNS -- THE CHILD REMANDED TO MRS. BURNS. -- The Philadelphia North American of yesterday says: ""Our Supreme Court, sitting in banco, yesterday decided (by a majority of three Judges to one) that EVA BELL WHITTEN, commonly known as 'ELLA BURNS,' be remanded to the care of Mrs. BURNS, to whom she was apprenticed by her father at the age of two years and eight months, and by whom she has been treated with maternal solicitude and affection. In other words, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declines interfering with the deliberate decision of a Judge of the Supreme Court of New-York. That decision gave the child to the care of Mrs. BURNS, under the guardianship of Mr. THAYER, one of the most reputable citizens of New-York; and Judge DAVIES, who heard and decided the case in New-York, consented, on application from Mr. THAYER, that the child should be permitted to visit Pennsylvania, and to read there, in public, or in private families, under restrictions which have not been violated. While Judge READ was speaking, the ladies who had charge of little ELLA were over-whelmed with dismay at the possibility of the Court taking her from their custody; but when the other Judges commenced, with an opposite view of the case, their feelings found vent in tears, in which the little child, from sympathy, freely joined. When the final order of the Court was made, little ELLA was seized by her friends and covered with kisses, and the parties left the Court in a high state of excitement. The father of ELLA was not present.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/22/archives/article-2-no-title.html,,"THE CASE OF ELLA BURNS -- THE CHILD REMANDED TO MRS.

It will be seen that this novel adversary, who is commonly supposed to be going about seeking whom he may devour, is simply an old foe with a new face, from whom we have nothing really strange and exceptional in the way of devastation to expect. It is quite true that the practice of salting the snow in our thoroughfares has already done not a little to deteriorate the average health as well as the average comfort of our population. But this, as will be seen, is to be attributed simply to the fact that by dissolving marine or muriatic acid saturated with mineral alkali, otherwise known as muriate of soda, otherwise again known as ""common salt,"" in water, or ice, or snow, you expand the liquid, augment its capacity for heat, and consequently depress its temperature. Any industrious housekeeper, who has accelerated the process of freezing ""iced-cream"" by putting rock-salt into her ""freezer,"" will readily appreciate this fact, even if she fails to comprehend its philosophical explanation. The process of strewing our snow-covered streets with salt, accordingly, subjects every man, woman, or child, whose feet may be immersed in the solution thus produced, (and now vulgarly known as ""Broadway at the crossings,"") to the immediate subtraction from his, her, or its body, of a certain measure of caloric essential to the due fulfillment of the vital functions.

The horse, said Mr. HOWARD, is a native of the Eastern Continent, and is still found wild in portions of Asia. In different countries we always find breeds with certain peculiarities, which adapt them to the soil and climate. The horse was early brought wild into this country, and from those thus introduced sprang the wild horses found on the plains ot Mexico. Tne Arabian horse is placed at the head of his species, though how long he has possessed this leadership is unknown. Job's sublime description of the war-horse could hardly apply to any other than the Arabian, and the sculptures obtained by Mr. LAYARD from the ruins of Nineveh reveal the fact that the horses of that day varied little from the present Arabian steed. They stand unrivaled for carrying great weights long distances. It is doubtful if any of the best type of these horses until quite recently have found their way to this country. The English race-horse stands at the head of all horses for speed. He is of modern origin. The term thorough-bred, which is applied to him, indicates that he is of pure blood, but this is not true; he being derived from a mixture of the Egyptian, Syrian, Turkish, Arabian and Grecian breeds. The roadster requires a different conformation from the racer. The latter requires to be nearly of the model of the hare; but this outline would ill become the roadster. The racer should have a long back; the roadster a short one. The racer requires a long pastern; the roadster a short one. So again the roadster requires the oblique shoulders, while many of our best racers have upright ones. The best illustration of the roadster we have in New-England is the Morgan horse. The coach horse belongs to a still different class. They should have fine hair, elegant outline, and showy. In England the Cleveland bay is the most popular, and they have lately been introduced into Virginia. Omnibus horses are much required in all our large cities. The Norman horse is the best breed of this variety I have seen They have great strength, are hardy and can travel with a heavy load from eight to ten miles an hour. Their height is about 15 hands, and their weight about 1,200 pounds. They are well adapted to farm labor. Draft horses are only suitable for heavy work, and the only gait required for them is the walk. They should have an upright shoulder, or nearly so, this being more favorable for power than the oblique. The leading breeds are the large English draft horse (weighing sometimes 2,400 pounds), the Suffolk, and the Clydesdale.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR.

It seems, at first sight, rather unfair for the City to accept the services of these eminent men without remunerating them in the usual manner. But the fact is that the question is entirely one of expediency, and justice is in no way mixed up in it. The two branches of the Common Council were established, not in order to provide a certain number of citizens with salaries, but to provide the City with a government. Nobody pretends, or has ever pretended, that one of the objects of the Charter is to secure forty-three gentlemen, to be designated by the electors, in the enjoyment of comfortable incomes. Its sole object is to provide a legislative body for the government of the municipality. This conceded, the question at once presents itself: Do we get a better government by not paying the Aldermen and Common Councilmen, than by paying them? If this can be answered truly in the affirmative, and we believe it can, it disposes completely of the matter in controversy. If the objects of the Charter are best carried out by withholding salaries, the salaries ought to be withheld; if not, not. The personal needs of the legislators have nothing to do with it. That the Boards which have been elected under the present Charter contrast very favorably with their predecessors under the old one, we think is tolerably well established. The government of the City is still bad, but it might be and has been worse, and the sovereign people has not, in the later manifestations of its will, dealt so hardly with us as on many former occasions; and the reason is obvious. In a City like this, a man who can do the duties of an Alderman, and earn his bread as well, is pretty sure to be an honester, more respectable and better-behaved man than an Alderman by profession. In other words, in the existing condition of ward politics, a person who has no ostensible means of support, and looks to being elected a municipal legislator for board and lodging, is pretty sure to be a worthless adventurer, and having no affairs of his own, is the last person in the world to be charged with the management of the affairs of other people. We do not assert or insinuate that penniless people are unfit for office, but we know as a matter of fact that penniless people in New-York, who take to ward politics for a livelihood, are, in nine cases out of ten, incorrigible scamps.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Salaries for the Common Council.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Salaries for the Common Council.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8b77a336-d52e-5b31-973f-e94aa4f5f9e1,685,nyt://article/8b77a336-d52e-5b31-973f-e94aa4f5f9e1,

Here the expectant tourist in this region may be instructed in regard to such prepation. Every arrangement should be as simple as possible. A man needs only a stout flannel hunting shirt, coarse and trustworthy trousers, woolen stockings, large heavy boots well saturated with a composition of beeswax and canow, a sort felt hat, and strong buckskin gloves. A woman needs a stout flannel dress, over shortened crinoline, of short dimensions, with loops and buttons to adjust its length; a hood and cape of the same materials, made so as to envelop the head and bust, and leave the arms free; woolen stockings, stout calfskin boots that cover the legs to the knee, well saturated with beeswax and tallow, and an India-rubber satchel for necessary toilet materials. Provisions, also, should be simple. The hunters live chiefly on bread or crackers, and maple sugar. The usual preparation is a sufficient stock of Boston crackers, pilot bread, or common loaf bread; butter, tea or coffee, pepper and salt, an ample quantity of maple sugar, and some salted pork, to use in frying or boiling fish, birds and game. The utensils for cooking are a short-handled frying-pan, a broad and shallow tin pan, tin tea or coffee-pot, tin plates and cups, knives, forks and spoons. These, with shawls or overcoats, and India rubber capes to keep off the rain, the guides will carry, with gun, axe and fishing-tackle. Sportsmen who expect to camp out some time, should take with them a light tent. The guides, will fish, hunt, work, build camps, and do all other necessary service, for two dollars a day and food. It is proper here to remark that the tourist should never enter this wilderness earlier than the middle of August. Then the flies and mosquitos, the intolerable pests of the forests, are rapidly disappearing, and fine weather may be expected. The sportsman must go in June or July for trout, and in October for deer. -- Art Journal.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tourists in the American Forests.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Tourists in the American Forests.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b10fc0d6-94ee-5cda-b914-a338d5029d4d,346,nyt://article/b10fc0d6-94ee-5cda-b914-a338d5029d4d,

Those who served at the table itself, whose business was chiefly to carve, and present the wine, were of still higher rank--never less than esquires -- and often, in the halls of princes and great chiefs, noble barons. The meal itself was conducted with the same degree of ceremony, of which a vivid picture may be drawn from the work called the Menagier de Paris"" composed about the year 1,393. When it was announced that the dinner was ready, the guests advanced to the hall, led ceremoniously by two maitres d' hotel, who showed them their places, and served them with water to wash their hands before they began.They found the tables spread with fine tablecloths, and covered with a profusion of richly-ornamented plate, consisting of salt-cellars, goblets, pots or cups for drinking, spoons, &c. At the high table the meats were eaten from slices of bread, called trenchers, (tranchoirs,) which, after the meats were eaten, were thrown into vessels called couloures. In a conspicuous part of the hall stood the dresser, or cupboard, which was covered with vessels of plate, which two esquires carried thence to the table to replace those which were emptied. Two other esquires were occupied in bringing wine to the dresser, from whence it was served to the guests at the tables. The dishes, forming a number of courses, varying according to the occasion, were brought in by valets, led by two esquires. Anassecur, or placer, took the dishes from the hands of the valets, and arranged them in their places on the table. After these courses, fresh table-cloths were laid, and the entremets were brought, consisting of sweets, jellies, &c, many of them molded into elegant or fantastic forms; and, in the middle of the table, raised above the rest, were placed a swan, peacocks, or pheasants, dressed up in their feathers, with their beaks and feet gilt. In less sumptuous entertainments the expensive course of entremets was usually omitted. Last of all came the dessert, consisting of cheese, confectioneries, fruit, &c, concluded by what was called the issue, (departure from table,) consisting of a draught of hypocras, and the bonte-hors, (turn out,) wine and spices served round, which terminated the repast. The guests then washed their hands and repaired into another room, where they were served with wine and sweetmeats, and after a short time they separated. The dinner served slowly and ceremoniously, must have occupied a considerable length of time. After the guests had left the hall, the servers and attendants took their places at the tables. -- Art Journal.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Dining in the Middle Ages.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Dining in the Middle Ages.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cce6cb8e-3895-536e-ad56-4b170c5efbbd,468,nyt://article/cce6cb8e-3895-536e-ad56-4b170c5efbbd,

There is no subject which possesses more momentous interest for the people of these States than this, and there is none which, to be discussed profitably, has more need to be discussed with candor and impartiality. What its fate has been, however, in our hands, everybody knows. It has had the misfortune to have a most important bearing upon one of the most exciting political controversies by which any country was ever agitated, and consequently so far from receiving the calm investigation due to the working of a great experiment in social and ethnological science, it has been treated precisely as an irate attorney treats a piece of adverse testimony, the effect of which on the jury he wishes to destroy. There is a large party amongst us who are -- and naturally, perhaps -- opposed to the emancipation of negro slaves, and they endeavor to help their cause by the constant iteration of the assertion that negroes are not fit for freedom. Before there were any free negro communities in existence, this proposition of course belonged to the same category with the theses of the old schoolmen. It might be true, and it might not; but whether it was or not, it was impossible to prove. It was of course most fallacious to argue from the past condition of a race as to what it could possibly achieve in the future, but as the conflict was one in which it was never intended that either science or logic should play a very leading part, this was not a matter of much moment.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jamaica Negroes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Jamaica Negroes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Travel and Vacations', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/35b4e45b-affa-52fa-9e67-4cf0c89def79,1709,nyt://article/35b4e45b-affa-52fa-9e67-4cf0c89def79,

The One Hundred and Twenty-eighth AnniverSary of the birth of WASHINGTON was perhaps in many respects much less respectable than any of the one hundred and twenty-seven which preceded it.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/23/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The One Hundred and Twenty-eighth AnniverSary of the birth of WASHINGTON was perhaps in many respects much less respectable than any of the one hundred and twenty-seven which preceded it. At daybreak the rain, provoked by a boisterous south-east wind, began to fall in torrents, visiting with impartial bounty nearly every point from which information reaches us, on the Atlantic seaboard. Of course, to so general and persistent a ""quencher"" no enthusiasm could be proof, and where the programme of observance was not wholly abandoned, the proceedings were of the most imperfect and disheartening character. To the actual state of the weather in this City, was added the unspeakable condition of the streets, the legacy of the last snow storm. Something had been done to purge the portion of Broadway ordinarily used as the processional and military line of march. The remainder, and all the lateral streets, were little better than a representation of the Dismal Swamp, with its canal capitally reproduced in duplicate. Yet we had our parades and processions. The Eleventh, Seventy-first, Sixty-ninth, Eighth and Twelfth Regiments turned out over fifteen hundred men, and the American Protestant Association about five hundred more. The Veterans of 1812 fired a national salute on the Battery at noon. Numbers of the firemen collected at Laird's square, in West Broadway, and tried their engines. In the evening there were lectures, soirees, reunions, and other ceremonies appropriate to the occasion. At Philadelphia the military, quite as enterprising as our own, united in the consecration of a monument at Roxbury, in honor of Revolutionary martyrs. At Baltimore the parade, though seriously diluted, was not foregone. At Boston the State fired its salute, to which the departing steamship Canada responded in lavish courtesy, adding a profuse display of flag and streamer from every available mast and pole. A similar compliment was paid by the Arabia, at her dock in Jersey City. These celebrations of the day were insignificant when compared with that which was in progress at Washington. In response to the invitation of the joint Congressional Committee having charge the arrangements for the inauguration of MILL's Equestrian Statue, companies of military from Baltimore, with our own Seventh Regiment, and civilians innumerable, sacrificed the claims of private business to those of patriotism, and took up their journey to the Capital. The storm which paid us such an untimely visit fortunately broke away in Washington before the day was over. The procession, in which were the President, Vice-President, and other high dignitaries, moved about 3 1/2 o'clock, and marched past the Presidential mansion through Pennsylvania-avenue to the circle inclosing the statue. When those who were entitled to the honor had taken seats upon the platform, Rev. Dr. NADAL offered an appropriate prayer, and after the delivery of an oration by Hon. THOMAS S. BOCOCK, of Virginia, the statue was unveiled by President BUCHANAN amid the plaudits of the multitude. The ceremonies over, the troops were reviewed by the President and the celebration was concluded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c8d4324-630b-5ee9-896f-663098fcb5f8,1314,nyt://article/4c8d4324-630b-5ee9-896f-663098fcb5f8,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/23/archives/the-storm-providential-streetcleaninggallantry-of-the-policevessels.html,,"Tha rain, as if in disgust at the dirty face which the City has lately worn, has condescended at Length to join the authorities in cleaning the streets. It is true, the authorities had a little the start in point of time; but they were so unaccustomed to any action for public relief, that the rain steadily gained on them, and at last came out many lengths ahead. The purification by the falling element was inaugrated yesterday noon, by firing cannons, and a display of flags from the City Hall, on the steps of which a dense throng had assembled for the purpose of witnessing the strange phenomenon of a public washing of New-York. When the rain had fairly begun its work, the crowd dispersed, as if satisfied with the display. The The evacuation of the mud from the City was hardly less grateful to the people than the departure of the National enemy, years ago, at the approach of that great man, in whose honor yesterday was kept. But the departure of this accumulation of snow and dirt excited serious apprehensions among the residents of the streets running down to the rivers. As the waters carried down the filth, the sidewalks were inundated, and some basements were injured. A volunteer corps of men, women and children, armed with shovels and brooms, stood at their doors, and with strenuous efforts drove the rushing filth from their threatened abodes. The wharves were flooded, and many cartloads of dirt were deposited upon the piers. But it was a great day for those chivalric gentlemen -- the Police. They were in their glory. In the time-tested fact that women will go out when it rains, if only to show their nicely made, pretty little water-proof boots, our gallant policemen found their principal exercise and greatest joy. The women did go out, even when the waters were highest in the streets, and as dirty as the highly-flavored Thames. In doing so, peradventure, they must go over the crossings, and what policeman with the heart of a HOWARD and the pluck of a HEENAN, (which every policeman has,) could remain quiescent when those highly-polished, distracting little boots were in danger of being soiled. To their everlasting credit be it said, they did not; but dashing through the slimy deeps, they seized the fair owners of these boots and bore them both to a place of safety, gallantly and triumphantly. But policemen are only human, after all, and have many of the failings that flesh is heir to -- one of the most prevalent being a partiality for the beautiful.

It is a souvenir of the times when marriageable women were shipped to any place that bore the general name of India, in the firm faith that they would there marry some one from the Governor downwards. The play is a peculiarly comic one, from the complications which arise between the right Governor and the right lady -- both for the matrimonial moment being impostors. Mrs. WOOD as Letty Briggs is especially jubilant and extatic. Mr. JEFFERSON as the mock Governor is confusedly great. The other parts, being amply filled, contribute to the comical perplexity of the dramatist's scheme, and involve a plot thoroughly farcical.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/23/archives/presidential-candidates.html,,"The number of candidates for the Presidency, especially on the Republican side, seems to be rapidly increasing. An appeal has been issued by a Committee appointed for that purpose in New-Jersey, nominating WM. L. DAYTON, and setting forth at length the manifold reasons which commend him to the support of the Republican Party. He was their candidate for Vice-President in 1856, it will be remembered, but failed to carry his own State. His identification with the old Whig Party, and with the scheme of protective tariffs, is cited by these gentlemen as reasons for his nomination. The People's Party in Pennsylvania, meantime -- which is invited by the Republicans call to send delegates to Chicago -- pronounces in favor of Senator CAMERON, and will doubtless urge him upon the National Convention.

The house was well filled by the friends of the Institution, and by the pupils, as well as by a large number of ladies and gentlemen, who testified their approval by their presence. The programme of the evening consisted of declamations by the young and old students of the school, interspersed with music by the orchestra band; and of a play from SHAKESPEARE -- ""The Merchant of Venice"" -- with an afterpiece, which unfortunately prolonged the exercises to the point of weariness. Prof. HEGEMAN, under whose direction the rehearsal had been conducted, took the character of Shylock, in which he showed himself fully at home, frequently bringing down the house with applause. The various parts were also well sustained by the students, exhibiting a good degree of talent, and no little labor in their preparation. The efforts of Gratiano to keep his mustache in place furnished much amusement to the boys, and when he tossed it behind the scenes in disgust, the gravity of the parents gave way, and they joined the boys in a hearty laugh. About one hundred and twenty-five dollars were realized for the newsboys. It was handed to Mr. BRACE at the close, and that gentleman made a handsome acknowledgement for the same.

The engraver's work, is, perhaps, less peculiarly adapted to the restless American organization, impatient of processes, and bent upon immediate results, than any other of the fine arts; but the strong feeling for color and chiaroscuro which seems to be the constant concomitant of any decided artistic ability in America, promises to bear such excellent fruits when properly applied in this direction, that we watch the gradual progress of our engravers with no slight or secondary interest. A not uncommon, but a very superficial notion, which one stumbles upon constantly in the current art-criticism of the day, threatens the engraver with the doom dealt out to the wicked overseer in the sensational drama of the ""Octoroon."" He is to be slain by means of the photograph. Nothing could be less reasonable than this impression, at least in the present stage of practica-photography. The photograph applied to a great picture does not reproduce, but simply represents it, limning through a medium of perspective which the painter never took into the account the precise mechanical and material facts of his work; through which, under the conditions prepared and considered by himself, he meant its strictly pictorial and intellectual effect to be reached. A moment's reflection will satisfy any one that whatever interesting tests may in this way be applied to a painter's manner of handling, to the accuracy of his design, to his power over atmospheric perspective, no properly artistic and picturesque reproduction of his thoughts can be so achieved as adequately to interpret that thought through a perfectly satisfactory, because perfectly independent and well-calculated form of expression. The engraver supplies precisely this form of expression which, so far as yet appears, we may never expect to see supplied by any strictly mechanical contrivance whatever, uninformed by that mysterious, but hitherto indispensable element of artistic success, the artistic human mind. The relation which the engraver bears to his original was not inaptly likened by ALLAN CUNNINHGHAM to that which the translator holds to his author. It may more fitly still be compared to that which exists between the composer who writes for a full orchestra and the artist who rearranges his composition for a single instrument. What GOODALL, WILSON, PYE, have done for the landscapes of TURNER, STANFIELD, and CONSTABLE, differs not essentially from the services rendered by LISTZ and THALBERG to BEETHOVEN and MEYERBEER and ROSSINI.

He has generally discharged his duty to the public with exemplary fidelity. Occasionally, however, the packages in his express chariot get sadly mixed, and he makes a mistake and delivers to us the wrong day. Yesterday one of these irregularities occurred. Whether or not the solar charioteer had imbibed too freely on the previous day, in honor of our illustrious pater patrioe, does not transpire. It is only known that for some cause or other, the inhabitants of this town, on opening the Municipal door to receive the usual auroral package, yesterday morning, found instead of a Winter day which was due, a bundle of beautiful, bright shining hours, that would reflect credit on an attempt of the riper end of April, or even of early May. Though the package was doubtless intended for a different destination, and only left with us by mistake, the temptation to appropriate its genial warmth was too strong to be resisted by even the proverbially tender conscience of honest New-York. Though all is not gold that gilters, yet yesterday was a golden day; one which reflected honor on Summer itself. No seasoning or flavor of spice was omitted to make its character complete. In the afternoon the usual shower of a Summer day came to perfect the illusion, and deceive terrestrials into the belief that the earth had really been hurried along already into the sweet vernal influences of the Pleiads. At sunset the clouds cleared away, and let in the last golden rays which blended the day into night.

Various bills were reported, and several introduced, before Mr. CHANDLER made an ineffectual effort to call up the President's veto of the St. Clair Flats Appropriation bill. The bill providing for the sale of arms to the States was discussed, the clause requiring the Superintendents of the National Armories to be officers of the Army meeting with opposition from Messrs. HALE, PUGH, and others. The subject was, after hasty treatment, laid aside, and the bill to prevent the issue of bank bills in the District of Columbia taken up. A clause prohibiting the circulation of any paper money in the District was finally passed by a large vote. The House renewed its effort to elect a Printer. Two ballots gave assurance that Mr. DEFREES, the Republican candidate, could not be chosen; and the name of Mr. SAMUEL BOWLES, of the Springfield Republican, was substituted. Mr. BOWLES proved even less acceptable than Mr. DEFREES; and on the fourth ballot Mr. EDWARD BALL, of Ohio, who took his place, came within one vote of election.

"The first lecture of the afternoon was on the different breeds of sheep, and was given by Mr. T.S. GOLD --I will kiss the book that I wrote that name just so last week, though the compositor made it read ""GOULD.""  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/24/archives/ts-gold-on-sheep-raising.html,,"The first lecture of the afternoon was on the different breeds of sheep, and was given by Mr. T.S. GOLD --I will kiss the book that I wrote that name just so last week, though the compositor made it read ""GOULD."" He had on the stage, for the purpose of illustrating his subject, a fine Spanish Merino from the flock of ALONZO WHITNEY, of Torrington, Conn.; also a splendid specimen of the Cotswold, imported by Mr. T. HITCHCOCK, of New Preston, Conn., from the flock of Mr. FLETCHER, of Shipton Sollers, Eng. It was his intention to show us, also, a sample of the middle wools, by exhibiting a South Down, but he failed to procure a specimen. The first part of the lecture was occupied with a description of the two different kinds of manufacture of wool -- one, the combing process, in which the long wools are used, and called combing because the wool is drawn between fine steel teeth. Of this worsted goods are made; also, blankets and mats. It is opposed to the other, or carding process, in that the fibre is required to lie as nearly as possible in parallel lines, and kept at its full length; whereas, in carding, the fibre is torn apart, and reliance placed upon the felting qualities of the wool to keep it together. These felting qualities were explained to depend upon the serrated side of the fibre of wool, as shown by the microscope. The finer the wool the greater the number of serrations, amounting sometimes to as many as 2,720 in the space of an inch. These, by their interlocking, hold the wool so firmly together that a good fabric may even be made by the process of felting alone. It is this property which causes fine wool fabrics to shrink or full more than coarse. Wool is capable, said the lecturer, of great extension -- a single fleece of coarse wool, of seven pounds weight, being capable of being spun out to a length of 155 miles.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'T.S.

Mr. THADDEUS HYATT, of our City, is especially pertinacious and diligent in this endeavor. He began by refusing peremptorily to obey the summons, and boldly confronting the power of the Government. After a little reflection, he graciously consented to go to Washington and appear before the Committee, but resolved when there not to open his mouth. On reaching Washington he solicited a delay of ten days, in order to consider whether he would answer the questions of the Committee or not. When this was refused he wrote a very long letter to Senator MASON, the Chairman of the Committee, remonstrating vehemently against the rejection of his reasonable and respectful request, and treating the Senator to a very transcendental disquisition upon the general powers of Government and the great dangers Mr. MASON runs of engendering ""the fierce brood that incubates where hate, within the shadows of tyranny, sits moodily fostering despair!""

"Every nation and every race of men seems to have its special incapacity as well as its special talent; and there can be little doubt,  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/24/archives/monumental-celebrations.html,,"we think, that we of the United States and of the British blood inherit, with many ancestral virtues, the British inability of parade. The individual successes of a DUGNUAY-TROUIN, a TOURVILLE, a JEAN BART, a SURCOUF, have not abated the world's general belief that a Frenchman at sea is like a cat in walnut shells. Lord WESTMORELAND relates that the only clever cook he ever met in Germany was a Parisian, who had lived twenty years in Dresden without learning the language, ""because he could see no use in talking to people who had no notion of a cuisine."" No man in his senses would ever think of employing a Turk to manage a steamer, unless on the Mississippi, where fatalism might well supply the place of skill, and a Moslem engineer heap up his fires with a more placid indifference to results than any Anglo-Saxon can possibly acquire. But neither a Frenchman in a gale off Cape Hatteras, nor a German in the kitchen of the Tuileries, nor a Turk in the engine-room of a Cunarder could make a more lamentable figure than is cut by your average English and American committees when they undertake to get up a magnificent celebration. It is a curious thing that this should be so, and the psychologists, if they have quite disposed of spiritualism and the doctrine of affinities, may amuse themselves with taking up this question. But so it is, and the attempt of Congress to inaugurate the statue of WASHINGTON at the Federal Capital on the day before yesterday was hardly a more conspicuous and melancholy illustration of the painful truth than was the gorgeous ceremonial of the burial of WELLINGTON in London eight years ago. Somehow or other they ""manage these things better in France."" The welcome of the ashes of the First NAPOLEON to Paris, under LOUIS PHILIPPE, the festival of Liberty under the Republic of February, the return of the armies of the Crimea and of Italy under the reigning Emperor, were perfect pageants, each in its way. The right people somehow find themselves in the right places; the feux-de-joie go off at the right moment; the speeches, if there are any speeches, flash up as appropriately, and explode in splendor as satisfactorily as the rockets. With us and our cousins, on the contrary, something is always getting out of order. Somebody is always particularly snubbed who ought to have been particularly honored. Somebody else, who promised to be present, and whose presence was essential, sends a letter of mingled lamentation and enthusiasm at the eleventh' hour, or comes and says some thing which makes everybody wish he had stayed at home; processions are sure to tie themselves up into a series of perplexing and provoking snarls; fireworks miss fire, or go off all at once in a premature Vesuvius of chaotic eruption. The British Parliament vote four hundred thousand dollars to bury England's greatest soldier as becomes her greatness and his own; the sincere sorrow of a mighty nation struggles to express itself in all imaginable solemnities of pomp and stately obsequies; London for a day suspends her busy breath to do him honor. But the Queen makes up her mind that it will not do for her to appear in the procession; a quarrel of precedence throws a whole string of distinguished carriages into confusion; and a stupid beadle keeps a circle of England's noblest and gravest dignitaries standing in a draught which sends them home weeping in no figurative sense, with genuine colds in the head.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Monumental Celebrations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Monumental Celebrations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e8300177-01fa-548e-acf9-e895945550cb,1391,nyt://article/e8300177-01fa-548e-acf9-e895945550cb,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/25/archives/musical.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC.--Mme. GAZZANIGA made her farewell appearance in grand opera last night, playing Saffo, (in the work of that name,) a part which she has made exclusively her own. The career of this truly great artiste since her arrival in America has been one round of unvarying successes. Unlike most popular favorites, her position was at first disputed, both by the Press and the public. It was objected that she could not sing, in the technical sense of the term, but admitted on all hands that she had moments of true inspiration. We are disposed to regard this estimate of Mme. GAZZANIGA's powers as the real secret of her continued popularity. There was nothing extravagant about it, and the lady not being burdened with a fictitious reputation, like so many of our prima donnas, was always capable of a higher flight. There cannot be a doubt that, as a sensational singer of the true Italian dramatic school, she has had no superior here. With a presence singularly pleasing, and a voice which, if not thoroughly fresh, has certainly vastly improved during her stay on our shores, Mme. GAZZANIGA has given to certain characters an impress of individuality which will not speedily be forgotton. Of the truly grand lyric artists who have purpose in what they do, she is the last. For the moment, at least, we must depend on singers merely, and gather our pleasures from the wonderful rather than the sublime. After a brief adieu to-morrow, at the matinee, Mme. GAZZANIGA proceeds on a concert tour, and subsequently will play an engagement in New-Orleans. It is hard to lose an artiste on whom we could always depend for a moment of exquisite pleasure, but the fiat has gone forth, and the magnates of the Academy are inexorable.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Musical.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Musical.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/05b0117b-3d57-572c-bff4-8f52f953aec7,508,nyt://article/05b0117b-3d57-572c-bff4-8f52f953aec7,

One Commissioner could not review the proceedings of another Commissioner, both having coordinate jurisdiction, and two persons could not be held at the same time for trial on the same charge.

It is simple justice to concede to him that the old-fashioned tavern, a place where might be had ""entertainment for both man and beast,"" bears quite as little resemblance to its offspring, the modern hotel, as the honest, pains-taking, gain-getting man of business who occasionally spent the night and ate his Breakfast at the former, does to his thriftless son who wastes his inherited wealth in the latter. Good fare, at comfortable bed, and a roaring bar-room fire were the perfection of tavern excellencies once. How different the metropolitan hotel of to-day. Heat from furnace, light from gas, waiters at the touch of bell-spring, reading-room, smoking-room, hot water or cold, [???]owing as readily at the touch of every guest, as from the ancient rock at the stroke of the prophet's wand, past-office, telegraph, a rattling gong, and two dollars and a half a day, are the inevitable concomitants of hotel-life, as it is now. Nor does there seem to be any limit to the adoption of new expedients for relieving guests from the necessity of the slightest physical exertion for the accomplishment of their wants. The latest illustration of this accommodating tendency of hotel-keepers is the introduction of an elevator to take gouty gentlemen and languid females from the dinner-table to their rooms above, without the intervention of stairs. The human package of dinner or ennui, entering an apartment not unlike a cushioned church-pew, finds itself in a few seconds carried to the top of the house by the revolution of a giant screw, to which the car is attached, as smoothly and quietly as many a church-goer hopes that he is gliding up, by the exertion of the priest, to whom as supporting column his faith is hung. We shall next expect to hear of some mechanical contrivance for putting lazy folks to bed, and a crank mill through which they will be run in the morning, to come out washed, cravated, brushed and combed, ready for the breakfast table, or rather, more probably the breakfast-stuffing machine, which will have taken its place.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CITY INTELLIGENCE.; LIQUOR-DEALERS' ASSOCIATION.

"The Bologna currespondent of the Daily News, writing on the 1st instant, gives the following account of his visit to Palazzo del Governo, the prison in which Father FELLETTI is confined, charged with the abduction of the child MORTARA.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/25/archives/the-inquisitor-of-the-holy-office-in-prison.html,,"The Bologna currespondent of the Daily News, writing on the 1st instant, gives the following account of his visit to Palazzo del Governo, the prison in which Father FELLETTI is confined, charged with the abduction of the child MORTARA. The room which he now occupies is called the Torrione, because it forms part of a massive tower on the northern side of the ancient building. It was about a quarter to ten when the turnkeys ushered me into the Torrione. The prisoner was then sitting at a wooden desk, which he had turned into a small altar for his private devotions. On entering I was struck with the cleanliness and monastic order which were discernible within. It was a lofty, vaultea room, twelve feet long by ten feet wide. The walls were cleanly white washed, and at the southern and northern sides two large windows protected by an [???] rail insured a copious and wholesome ventilation. The pavement had been expressly covered with matting, and a large stove had been placed in a corner of the room to warm it. The clean iron bedstead stood at the right-hand side of the door, and opposite it there was a large oak table, upon which bottles of wine had been placed in an orderly row by the prisoner, together with an abundant supply of dishes, forks, knifes and spoons. This was the batterie de cuisine of Father FELLETTI. A glance at the labels on the bottles inspired me with respect for the Father's judgment, and the resources of his extempore cellar. The wine of Monte Pulciano, the Alcatico of Florence and the famous Vino Santo were all included in the collection. An abundant store of sweet Bolognese cakes, called biscottmi, was heaped up at the side of the bottle; and from what the turnkeys told me Father FELLETTI has a proper appreciation of these delicacies, which are regularly sent to him by the pious ladies who used to confess to him when he was free. On my entering into the comfortable room Father FELLETTI rose from his arm-chair, bidding me good morning, with the usual monastic formula, ""God be praised."" He was dressed in the white loose woolen robes of his order, with a long black narrow s[???]plice, which descended from the shoulders nearly to the extreme edge on it. His head was covered with a white hood, which he had drawn up to protect it. Although the prisoner is not yet 62 years of age, he looked a great deal older, and being short and thin the large to[???]s of his [???] [???] closely about his [???]. Having read so much about the hence characters of ancient and modern inquisitions of the Holy Office, I must say I rather expected to find Father FELLETTI of a somewhat austere countenance. On the contrary, the expression of his pale face is decidedly prepossessing. His spacious forehead and the well marked lines of his mouth be[???]okened, however, a certain amount of character and determination, which now and then became more apparent from the rapid movements of his eyes. On the whole, he gave me the impression of a good pious man, [???]o belongs. I had afterwards an opportunity of ascending that such is the reputation he has long enjoyed at Bologna, where he discharged the rather [???] duties of holy inquisitor for 26 years, without weighing too heavily upon the population which fell within his jurisdiction. If in the Mortara affair he acted with inhumanity and harshness, it was because orders were sent from Rome to this effect, and because he had a blind and unreasoning [???] that he was doing what his religion enjoined. Before leaving the [???]orrtoue, I asked Father FELLETTI whether he was humanely treated in his prison. Not knowing who I was and for what reason I had been allowed to visit him, he did not give any positive answer to my question. Lifting up both his eyes and his shoulders, he only made a gestate which meant that he was resigned to his fate. The turnkey, who had caught sight of it, urged him to answer, but no answer was given.

But in an evil hour he determined to convert his flour into loaves, or, in other words, turn ""boss baker,"" and on doing so, found he could, owing to his flour business, sell bread cheaper than his neighbors, and has ever since been doing so. The other bakers, finding themselves unable to compete with him, and that the bread eaters, with strange perversity, prefer cheap loaves to dear ones, held a meeting, and resolved to call upon HECKER in a formal and solemn manner, either to sell as dear bread as other people, or else stop selling bread altogether. With this modest request we presume he declined to comply, as we rind in yesterday's TIMES the report of another meeting held by the aggrieved bread-makers, in order to combine upon a plan for inflicting summary vengeance upon him. They then and there resolved to not only withdraw their patronage from HECKER themselves, but from every flour-dealer who bought any of his flour.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cheap Bread and the Bakers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cheap Bread and the Bakers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab92289b-869d-5ba6-b3ea-4da1c7a32395,705,nyt://article/ab92289b-869d-5ba6-b3ea-4da1c7a32395,

Of course every fresh execution of one of JOHN BROWN's accomplices will give a fresh, argument to such orators as Mr. PHILLIPS, towards convincing the people of the North that the terror of insurrection is busy at the heart of the South, and that it is idle to talk of dealing justly by men who can be coerced by their fears into accepting the Union at any price. For the cry of Northern, like the cry of Southern Disunionists, means, in nine cases out of ten, not Disunion at all, but simply supremacy in the Union, and the power of overriding all constitutional guarantees to establish a fanatical creed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""John Brown's Accompliees."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""John Brown's Accompliees."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d913d105-745f-54b2-bf06-2b79238f52cb,329,nyt://article/d913d105-745f-54b2-bf06-2b79238f52cb,

The writer sketches the history of the territory from the sixteenth century to 1815, when, at the Congress of Vienna, it was leid down as a principle by the great Powers that the absolute neutrality of the Swiss Republic was a European necessity, and that in that view it was important to give her a strong natural boundary. In fact, the question of Savoy, he says, is a question of physical geography. The Genevese Commissioners represented that the arrangements under the first treaty of Paris did not gain those ends; they therefore proposed that, subject to the sovereignty of Sardinia, Chablias and Faucigny should be included in the neutrality of Switzerland, and accompanied the details necessary to carry out this plan by the suggestion that Sardinia should engage never to cede nor exchange these possessions, and negotiations were in existence when the landing of NAPOLEON I from Elba caused a renewal of the alliance of the great Powers, to which Switzerland gave her adherence, with a force of 40,000 men, and opened the short campaign terminated by the second peace of Paris. The Swiss and Sardinian questions were taken up, and by a treaty signed on the 20th November, 1815, by Austria, France, Great Britain, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Sweden and Spain, it was agreed that the portion of Savoy which, at the first peace of Paris had been retained by France, should be restored to Sardinia, and the article of March 29, 1815, of the Congress of Vienna, by which, ""in the event of war,"" those portions of Sardinian Savoy called Chablais and Faucigny were declared to participate in the neutrality of Switzerland, was confirmed. A treaty was entered into in 1816 between Switzerland and Sardinia, by which the necessary details for placing Chablais and Faucigny under Swiss military occupation in the eventuality of war, for withdrawing the Sardinian troops, and for settling a well defined boundary to the neutral portion of the territory, were agreed on.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANNEXATION OF SAVOY.; The Cession Reported to have been Made.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANNEXATION OF SAVOY.; The Cession Reported to have been Made.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Crime and Criminals', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee504f59-2e91-506e-928e-8b7796b5ffa6,772,nyt://article/ee504f59-2e91-506e-928e-8b7796b5ffa6,

The House having resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means, he said that the year 1860 had long been marked out as an importent epoch in British commerce.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/25/archives/introduction-of-the-british-budget.html,,"In the House of Commons, on the 10th instant, the Chancellor of the Exchequer rose to make his financial statement. The House having resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means, he said that the year 1860 had long been marked out as an importent epoch in British commerce. The long annuities, amounting to £2,146,000, fell in; the war duties on tea and sugar, unless renewed, relapsed. Finally, the commercial treaty with France compelled the Government to adopt a new and unusual course. In making the financial statement before taking votes in supply, the result of the past financial year, inasmuch as that year had not been completed, must be given partly in the form of estimate; but the House might rely on the figures. Exceptional cases had affected the estimates. There was the expedition to China, and the additional cost of our military preparations. There was the French Treaty to be provided against in addition. Coming to the actual state of affairs, he showed that the total result of the revenue of the last year showed an increase over the estimate. The revenue had been estimated at £69,460,000; it had produced £70,578,000. On the other hand, the expenditure, estimated at £68,953,000, had been £69,270,000. It thus appeared that, under existing arrangements, there was an excess of income over expenditure. The excess, though it was already absorbed by disturbing causes, showed the wisdom of the arrangements of Parliament. The expedition to China, and excess of navy and army expenditure, had cost an additional £900,000 for the army, and £270,000 for the navy. The commercial treaty would, he calculated, cause a deduction of £640,000. This would cause a total deduction of £1,810,000, and would place us rather on the wrong side of the balances. But to compensate for this, he had received, most unexpectedly, part of a debt from Spain, in the shape of bills, to the amount of £500,000, half of which would fall due in the present financial year. In this way the balance would be reestablished. The estimated expenditure for the coming year involved an increase in the army and navy of £3,618,000. The total expenditure is estimated at £70,100,000. The estimated income for the coming year would not, in the first instance, be satisfactory; but, at all events, it would compel their attention to those matters which most require examination. He should estimate the revenue as the law at present stood, taking the duties on tea and sugar at the minimum and reduced rates, the income tax as it would stand under existing arrangements -- upon these terms the estimate of revenue for the coming year would give a total of £60,700,000, showing a deficit of £9,400,000. He did not ask them to provide for the payment of Exchequer bonds soon becoming due. Without this they had the deficit of £9,400,000. If they had not the treaty to deal with, they would know precisely what they had to face. They might keep the duties of tea and sugar at the present rate, which would leave the deficit at £7,300,000. Even this would involve an income tax of 9d. in the pound. To fill up the deficit as it stood, this would require the neat and intelligible income tax of ls. in the pound. Now came the question, what had become of the estimates of 1853? He had a clear answer to give. The succession duty had failed from causes due to the actual law. The debt caused by the Russian war entailed a large charge on the consolidated fund and the army and navy expenses now entailed upon us. The deficit thus caused was, however, fully compensated by the financial measures they had since adopted. The real cause was the immense increase of expenditure. Had that expenditure remained as it was in 1852, they would now have had a surplus of two millions. That increase amounted to no less than £14,720,000, equivalent to an income tax of 13 1/2d. in the pound. It would not, however, be fair to consider the increase of expenditure without taking into account the increase of its means. This was especially shown by the results of the income tax He went through the results of several years, showing an increase in the wealth of the country of 12 per cent, in the twelve years between 1842 and 1853, and of 16 1/2 per cent, in the six years from 1863 to 1859. No schedule shows a larger increase than that of the agriculturist, whose income had exceeded nineteen percent. Meanwhile, the expenditure has interested in a still greater proportion. In the years from 1842 to 1852 it had increased 4 1/2 per cent and in the years 1862 to 1856 it increased to 26 1/2 per cent. The increase was still more evident in that expenditure which was under the control of Parliament, and which he might call the optional expenditure; in that the increase, during the last six years, was not less than 58 per cent. Recurring to the means of meeting the deficit, he owned, that no was not satisfied with our system of expenditure; still, all changes must, of necessity, be gradual. There were again, commercial reforms and improvements. There were those who considered, that these reforms ought to be kept for fair weather and a flourishing exct[???]quer. Against that doctrine be earnestly protested He declared, on the part of the Government, that they were ready and prepared to go forward in commercial improvement. It was only by means of these reforms that the country was enabled to bear high taxation I Could the country have borne the High income tax of the last eighteen months if it had not been for increased taxation He showed from figures that the relaxation and reform of the commercial system had given the country not only this disposition but the power to pay this, inasmuch as the revenues of the departments were increased as the duties were relaxed. It thus appeared that indirect taxation should be relaxed in favor of direct taxation, and it only remained to us to say upon what principle. The Government did not at present intend to deal with tea and sugar. These were merely revenue duties, and involved none of the complexities of differential duties. The tailoring classes were more benefited by an enlarged system of tree trade than by relaxing individual duties, as creating higher price for labor. It was upon this principle the Government intended to act. They proposed to retain the tea and sugar duties at the present late for a year. He then gave an outline of the French Commercial Treaty. France reduces, from July 1, 1860, duties on coal; from Oct. 1, on iron; from Dec 1, on tools; from June 1, 1861, on goods manufactured from flax, hemp and jute; from Oct. 1, 1861, France removes all prohibitions on all English manufactured goods, placing on them an ad vstorem duty not exceeding 30 per cent. This maximum is, after three years, to be reduced to 25 per cant. On the other hand, England, on her part, abolished immediately and without exception all duties on manufactured goods. We reduce the duty on brandy from 15s. a gallon to the colonial duty of 8s. 2d.; and the duty on wine from 5s.10d. to 3s.; to be further reduced from April, 1861, upon a scale depending upon the strength of the wine. As to the effect of these reductions, he estimated from wine relief to the consumers of £830,000, and a loss to the revenue £515,000; on brandy, a revenue to the consumers of £446,000, and a loss to the revenue of £225,010; and the loss to the revenue on manufactured goods at £432,000, He declared that the treaty showed no subserviency to France. They had given nothing to France which they had not given as a rich gift to themselves, and they had made no sacrifices except what they would have made in any case under an enlightened system of trade. The system had answered its purpose of political estrangement, but political estrangement, but the new system answers its purpose by political amity. The union which had been in former days between France and England -- a union of the Governments -- should now be the union of the nations, He defended commercial treaties, when not arounded upon principles of exclusion, and gloried in avowing that the treaty was a consummation of free trade. He, entered into an elaborate defence of the treaty, declaring that we shall do equal good to ourselves and to France by the introduction of a liberal system, and declaring that wine, which, like tea in the last century, was the rich man's luxury, would, like tea, be the poor man's comfort. He denied that any of the duties repeated were revenue duties. As a proof they were only opposed by interested parties. He entered at great length into the wine trade, to show how injuriously the present system operated and what good effect might be expected by the alteration we had now done with France, what we had been laboring to do for years past. He paid a warm tribute to Mr. COBDEN, who as the apostle of free trade, had twice in his life achieved so signal a triumph. He stated that the immediate repeal of duties on French articles was not dressed by the French Government. On the contrary, it was the device of our own. He then came to a supplemental reform in the customs, giving a relief to the consumers of a[???] a million, and a less to the revenue of £010,000. He proposed to abolish the duties on butter, cheese, oranges, and eggs, and to recu[???]e those on timber and currants and hops. In return he proposed to levy on all articles exported or imported a registration due of one penny per packet. It gave a great [???]tea of the transactions of the country, that they would produce £300,000 per annum. He further proposed to lay moderate charges upon certain warehousing proceedings performed in the customs' offices for the benefit of the importer. By this they expected; £120,000. He then proposed a duty of 6s. per cwt. on chicory, as a protection, the coffee revenue. This, with an improvement on the coffee revenue which it would cause would profuse £90,000, Again, he proposed a penny stamp in brokers' contracts; a 3d. stamp upon dock warants; licenses to eating houses to sell wine and beer; a reduction in game certificates, which would increase the sale, granting those certificates for a few months at a reduced cost; to remove the execution from stamps or on checks drawn to self. He likewise repeated some other small stamp exemptions. He thus obtained an increase of £510,000 in the Customs, and £3;6,000 in the Inland Revenue. In management they hope to save £50,000 in Customs and £36,000 in the Inland Revenue. The total would be £981,000; thus compensating the second part of these Customs reforms. Thus, on the whole, including the loss on the French treaty, the new arrangements involved a loss of about £1,000,000. He next came to a larger item. He proposed to repeal the paper duty. That duty has already been condemned by a direct vote of that House. The actual duty not only operated unjustly against publications for the masses, but prevented the manufacture of paper from an enormous quantity of fibrous substances. So many articles might be made out of paper that a vast impulse would be given to rural labor. The Inland Revenue itself admitted that the present Jaw was untenable, and fully agreed with the Abolitionists that it ought to be repealed. The next repeal was that of the improved stamp upon newspapers, which involved great trouble and inconvenience. For the convenience of the newspapers who paid a three halfpenny stamp he proposed to introduce a three halfpenny book postage. He next proposed to abolish the hop credits, while on the other hand, he reduced the duty, which, including the paper duty, was a remission of one million, and considering the increase of consumption, which he valued at £840.000, the total loss to the revenue would be £3,000,000. while the relief to the consumers would be £3,931,000. Making further allowance for the new charges, and the saving in management, the net loss to the revenue would be £28,000. Thus, in the present year only forty six articles remained on the tariff, and only forty-four would remain in 1861. The tariff would be relieved of all its remaining deformities. He had proposed to take up hop and malt credits, which would give $1,400,000 to the Treasury in the present year. The account then stood thus for the coming year; expenditure, £70,000,000; income, made actual law, £60,700,000. From this deduct loss by remission of duty, which would reduce it to £58,592,000. But he proposed to retain the present tea and sugar duties, which raised the income to £60,002,000. This leaves a deficit of nine millions and a half. Against this there was the £140,000 of the malt and hop credits. To provide for the remainder, he proposed an income tax of 10d. in the pound on incomes above £150, and of 7d. on incomes under that sum, which would produce £8,481,000, and thus completely fill up the deficiency. This tax, and the present duties on tea and sugar, to continue only for the year. He concluded by a warm eulogium on the blessings of improved laws and a well regulated finance. A formal vote for imposing a duty upon chicory was then proposed.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Introduction of the British Budget.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Introduction of the British Budget.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f20c055e-be70-5066-b2d9-85df3ada58e0,2324,nyt://article/f20c055e-be70-5066-b2d9-85df3ada58e0,

Little more than three years ago Mr. TEFF[???] sailed for Europe. He was then in excellent health, and had the promise of a fine career before him. In early boyhood his taste for architecture attracted the notice of his friends, and he was placed under the tuition of Messrs. TALLMAN & BUCKLIN, of Providence. While under their care he found, or rather made, an opportunity for the study of the Greek and Roman classics, with other branches of collegiate study, and graduated at Brown University in 1851. Already he had made designs for several public buildings, and before he had attained his twenty-first year the Depot in Providence was erected from one of these, and has ever since been considered one of the handsomest edifices of which that city can boast. ""Later in life,"" writes one of his numerous friends, ""he designed and superintended the erection of numerous edifices, public and private, and in many of the villages of the State (Rhode Island) will be found the graceful spires of churches and attractive school houses, built under his direction, and which are always referred to as models of good taste. He lived in a world of art, and it was the study of his life how best to promote a love for that which to him was so worthy of devotion."" Several public buildings in Massachusetts, and at Richmond, Virginia, were erected by him. But his ambition tempted him to higher achievments, and to complete his architectural education, he resolved to study the cathedrals and temples of the greatest masters in the Old World.",T,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Thomas A.

"Soon after 10 o'clock on Saturday night, John J. Wagner, the night watchman employed in the silk and fringe warehouse of Messrs. Dexter, Lambert & Co., No. 540 Pearl-street, was alarmed at hearing a noise in the upper part of the building. Suspecting that burglars were at work, he secured the assistance of Officers Huggins, Maguire and Porcher, of the Sixth Precinct, who, on making investigation, found two men overhauling the goods on the second floor of the warehouse As soon as the thieves were aware that they had been detected, Charles Murphy, one of them, endeavored to escape by jumping from a window to the sidewalk. Officer Huggins ordered him to surrender, and as he refused to do so, discharged one barrel of his revolver in the direction in which he stood, with the object of intimidating him. At this Murphy darted up stairs, and reaching the upper story, got through the skylight to the roof of the building, which is 80 feet above the ground. Louis Bernowski, a Pole, the other burglar, who had been secured, united with the policemen in advising Murphy to descend from the roof and submit to arrest. He would not heed them, however, but jumped from where he stood, a distance of 30 feet, to the peaked roof of the adjoining building, and sliding down, was precipitated an additional distance of 50 feet, to the ground, striking upon the pavement, in an alleyway between the two stores. The officers, on searching for him, found him lying on the pavement, perfectly insensible, with his right thigh fractured in such a manner that the bones protruded from the flesh at right angles, his left leg broken near the knee, and his race and head shockingly cut. He was at once removed to the Hospital, where he lies at present in an extremely precarious condition. The surgeon says that it will be necessary to amputate both his legs, and that it is probable he will not survive the operation. The injured man is represented by the Police to be a desperate character. He is a Canadian, and not more than twenty-two years of age. His confederate Bernowski was taken before Justice OSBORN, by whom he was committed to prison. In the possession of the prisoners were found a loaded five-barreled pistol, a dirk knife, a gold watch and chain, two large ""jimmies,"" a brace and bit, a dark lantern and six skeleton keys. An examination of the premises showed that entrance had been effected through the basement, the door of which had been forced, and that by cutting away the heavy plank of the floor above an aperture had been made large enough to admit the body of a man. The goods on this floor had been thoroughly overhauled by the burglars, but none seemed valuable enough to them to pay for the trouble of removal. To get into the hallway from Messrs. DEXTER, LAMBERT & Co.'s store the thieves had broken through a slight partition and forced the door of Messrs. HAMILL & BOOTH's store in the floor above, where they selected about $4,000 worth of silk goods which were packed ready for removal.

Mr. Superintendent WILEY has just rendered to Gov. ELLIS the annual report of the School Department -- a document perspicuous and sensible enough, so far as it relates to the educational interests of the State, and full of pleasant reports of the joy of apt scholars and the gladdened hearts of satisfied teachers. But Mr. WILEY goes a step further than ordinary School Superintendents usually do. He addresses the Governor a long homily upon the questions at issue between the North and the South, indulges in flights of fancy, and rounds his periods with the skill of an accomplished rhetorician. ""This report,"" he says, ""is made to your Excellency at a time of trial, to you and to all patriotic guardians of the public interests."" He portrays the agitation of the popular heart, deplores the bitter hatreds and fraternal strifes of the day, and finds cause to apprehend a general split of society into ""innumerable hostile fragments,"" and the ""setting of every man's sword against his fellow."" After painting a gloomy picture of the chaos toward which he considers the country to be rapidly tending, he calls upon the Governor to ""adhere to those principles of benevolence which have governed us in the past, and to remember that though our race is a fallen one, it is not forsaken by a gracious Creator, nor wholly abandoned to its evil instincts;"" and, with a passing allusion to Harper's Ferry, winds up with a generous laudation of North Carolina and a special puff for his Excellency the Governor -- whom Mr. WILEY regards as one of the wisest and purest of living statesmen.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Aspiring Superintendent.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Aspiring Superintendent.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9a46ed29-cb5b-57a5-ae80-905cd41b7b4d,491,nyt://article/9a46ed29-cb5b-57a5-ae80-905cd41b7b4d,

Instead of demanding a sum of $5,000,000, from the Legislature, the Commissioners, in their report of Feb. 7, 1860, asked for a sum ""not to exceed $2,500,000,"" and to be expended in accordance with specifications fully and clearly set forth. The cost of maintaining the Park, moreover, which seems likely to be treated as a new and fearful drain upon our resources by hasty enthusiasts in search of a new economy without the smallest reference to its eventual effects on the public service, has up to the present time been comprised in the cost of construction, no separate provision having been made for it whatever. Nor should it be forgotten, when the actual expenditure thus far made upon the Park is contrasted with the limit of cost set forth in the original act creating the institution, that the real question is not whether the Commissioners have kept within a certain arbitrary limit of price, but whether they have been expending the public money in such a way as to secure the best present and future for the Park at the lowest reasonable cost. The original act, it must be remembered, was drafted by legislators necessarily inexperienced in the practical work of making a Park. The actual Commissioners are men of character, representing all parties, enjoying the confidence of the community, and working in harmony with a tried and efficient Superintendent. No sensible person will claim that the author or authors of the original act were so specially inspired for the express purpose of estimating the cost of Parks, as that their perfectly arbitrary and theoretical notions must outweigh the deductions of men who have been doing what they only thought about. The people of New-York do not care in the least how much their-Park costs, provided it costs no more than it fairly ought to cost, the final result being considered, and provided also that the expenditure is so made as in nowise to increase the burdens of taxation. In point of fact both of these provisions have been met in the management of the Central Park as it is. A cheaper Park would unquestionably have cost us more; and this apparent paradox will be perfectly intelligible to any citizen who will consider for a moment whether he would rather own a dwelling-house on Union-square or on the Battery, at the present day. Had the Park been carelessly and cheaply laid out and carried on, it would have sunk into the condition of a mere job; no speculation would have been attracted to its vicinity; land about it would not have risen in value, and the burden of its cost would have fallen upon an unchanged valuation of real estate. As it now is, the emphatic rise in the valuation of real estate which the City Comptroller traces to the excellent reputation and consequent influence of the Central Park improvement, really squares and more than squares our account for us.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Cost of the Park.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Cost of the Park.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'CENTRAL PARK (NYC)', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/109e290d-774c-5080-93bc-52db22f28d79,547,nyt://article/109e290d-774c-5080-93bc-52db22f28d79,

The inquiry naturally arises, why do these two powers throw obstructions in the way of an enterprise designed to be of such incalculable benefit to the civilized world? It is plain enough to every one familiar with European politics and diplomacy, that the refusal of Turkey to satisfy the contract entered into by the Pasha of Egypt and France, grows out of the interference and opposition of England, acting through her Minister at Constantinople. But after the various powers of Europe least interested in the Canal have given in their adhesion, not only to the project, but the terms on which it is to be carried out, the reason why England, whom it would benefit beyond all other nations, should be so hostile to it, is not so clear. LESSEPS with his corps of engineers is already on the ground -- terms satisfactory both to the French Government and the Pacha of Egypt have been agreed upon; and yet everything is held at dead lock by the British Government. This canal, which it is proposed to make capacious enough to admit vessels of the largest size, and which, if completed, will shorten the voyage from England to her East India possessions from 9,000 to 12,000 miles, and be a saving to her of millions a year in the transportation of merchandise alone, she stubbornly opposes. As far back as 1856, the English tonnage that passed the Cape of Good Hope amounted to 1,771,781 tons per annum. This, of course, has largely increased since. The whole amount going to Europe by this route is estimated to be three millions of tons. The opening of China and Japan will increase this amount vastly. This estimate of the advantage to accrue to England leaves out entirely the value of time to her, not merely in transporting merchandise but troops, as was painfully exhibited in the recent rebellion in India. What objections can England urge as an offset to these immense advantages? The English Press denies that they are of a political character, and scouts the intimation that the construction of the canal would ""pierce the cuirass of England."" The chief reason is, doubtless, to be found in the morbid suspicion and jealousy she cherishes towards all other nations which seek to share with her the commerce of the East, and especially of France, the moment she turns her eye in that direction. When the Indus formed the western frontier of the India possessions, the Company saw in all the troubles between Persia and Affghanistan the workings of French and Russian emissaries, and there was ever present to its diseased imagination the terrible apparition of French legions pouring through the frightful Koord Cabul and Khyber passes and laying waste its possessions beyond the Indus. This made England again and again go to war with Persia right in the face of solemn treaties, and finally invade Affghanistan with which she was at peace. The total destruction of an army of 16,000 men in one of these gorges -- the Sikh wars with the evils that followed, were the fruits of this groundless fear. It is this same vague, indefinable fear that makes her now oppose the French project of a canal across the isthmus of Suez -- a work so imperatively demanded in the present advanced state of civilization. It being common property, as each nation is to bear its proportion of the 200,000,000 of francs required to construct it, renders it impossible for France to monopolize it for her own aggrandizement, while going as it does from sea to sea, it is too paltry to pretend that it is a rival route to the little railroad running from the Nile, at Cairo, across to Suez.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Suez Canal.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Suez Canal.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Suez Canal', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/209f5af4-deaa-5357-8444-0eddd640fc9a,1305,nyt://article/209f5af4-deaa-5357-8444-0eddd640fc9a,

"GRACE HEENAN, employed as cook in the family of Rev. J.C.

Visions may have arisen in his mind of the horrid gibbeting of his powdered bones, -- wrought into various-moulded forms, -- on the head tray of some ragged Italian exile. The break-neck races in which rival coaches enter, over the frost-roughened pudding-stone pavement of Fulton-street, would save such imaginings from every imputation of undue nervousness of body or mind on the part of those who entertain them. The attempted transfer of the institution of horse-racing from the Bloomingdale road, where it belongs by prescription, to the blooming dales and hills of the Central Park, has recently been nipped in the bud by the legal pincers. This is very well if it shall be followed by the use of the legal forceps for the removal of the more deeply-rooted coach-racing nuisance. It certainly seems unjust, that while a man in his own vehicle, risking chiefly his own neck, is checked by the brakes of the law, the drivers of coaches, freighted with the public, should be allowed to dash on, at almost steam engine speed, through the City's busiest streets.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-02-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0db2b64a-35c4-55b6-ae0f-a809a1fdf6e5,1588,nyt://article/0db2b64a-35c4-55b6-ae0f-a809a1fdf6e5,

"Right Rev. Dr. SPALDING, of Louisville, Ky., delivered a lecture in the main hall of cooper Institute last evening, before the Catholic Library Association. The platform was occupied by CHAS O'CONOR and a number of Fathers in the Catholic Church, and besides, the Association there was a very good and a very appreciative audience. The subject of the reverend lecturer was ""European Civilization before the Reformation."" Civilization he defined, to be liberty reclaimed from barbarism; and as apparent, among other things, in refinement and gentleness of manners. The date of the starting point of all civilization he fixed from the fall of Rome; and from that he would speak, first, of Roman Pagan civilization, and, second, of modern Christian civilization. Pagan' Rome, he said, did not know even the definition of humanity, charity, or mercy. It enriched, itself by impoverishing others, and sought its own aggrandizement in the abasement of those against whom it fought. Christian civilization lifted up and humanized, and for that Christian civilization they were indebted to the Catholic Church. Modern Christianity arose and came gradually over a sea of barbarism. They all knew how in the earlier times the barbarian hordes went forth and laid waste the whole face of Europe; and they knew, too, that the old Roman Empire was crushed -- they knew also that the was then in the world that which should never be prevailed against -- [applause] -- and that the living Church, which had for a time to lend its head to barbarism, at length conquerors the conquerors of Rome. [Applause.] From the fifth to the twelfth century that living Church sent out missionaries of her faith throughout Europe. First to Ireland, where she sent her first end best, (St. Patrick.) and for three centuries afterwards Ireland was the centre of civilization. After Ireland, missionaries were sent to the nation of the Franks, to England, to Scotland, and so on until the cross was planted and the cross revered where the Roman eagles had never been. The Northerns became Catholics, but they were rude and uncultivated -- they were neither refined nor gentle; and yet ere five centuries had passed the Church had reduced the wolves who came down to devour her to the gentleness of the lambs of her own flock. [Applause.] It had been said that the priests of the Church rushed into power -- grasped in from the people -- but the fact was, and there was excellent authority for asserting it to be so, that power was thrust upon the priests -- that they were asked to take it. It was the priests who originated deliberative bodies, and through them improved the barbarian mind. It was the Church that broke down the Feudal system, under which border war was the rule and peace the exception; it was the Church that, when they were engaged in the destruction of each other, proclaimed the truce of God. Then came the development of the spirit of chivalry to protect the weak against the strong, and particularly the weaker sex against wrong from the stronger. And when in jousts and tournaments there were injury and death, it was the Church that proclaimed either a great modification in their conduct, or their either abolishment. [Applause.] At the time of which he was speaking, it must be borne in mind that the great mass of the people were serfs, who could be slain by their masters for the most trivial crimes; and, as a provision against that, it was the Church that proclaimed the asylum to which they could flee, and where, once within its walls, no one dared to molest them. [Applause.] It was through the instrumentality of the Church, too, that the serf system was broken down, and that it in the main had ceased during the fourteenth century. In Russia such was not the case, for Russia had separated from the Catholic Church in the eleventh century. They opposed the Pope, and they are serfs still. In fact, so strongly were they opposed to him, that, when he changed the calendar, as astronomy and intelligence dictated, they refused to accept the change, and ever since had been twelve days behind. Such was a part of the civilizing influences of Christianity in what some were pleased to call the Dark Ages. It was not exactly the civilization we were getting now. Now we were being civilized down, into coal mines, and gold mines, and so on; it was not upward to God, as was the civililization of the so-called Dark Ages. [Applause.] All Europe was even now strewn with the monuments of the Christian refinement and benevolence of those ages. [Applause.] It was through the Church, and at that time, that literature and art were developed. There were three prominent causes that contributed to the development of literature and art. The first was the preservation of the Latin language in the Church service; second, the monastic institute, and third, pilgrimages. The Church service being in Latin, the priests must learn the Latin language. In the monasteries the monks copied the Bible and the valuable literature of the time; and by pilgrimages valuable knowledge was acquired and spread abroad. He would make an assertion which, to some, might seem hazardous, but which he believed to be fully true; and that was, that during the three centuries that preceded the Reformation, there were more great inventions than during the three succeeding centuries. Cotton paper was known and used in the tenth century, and linen paper in the fourteenth. Clocks were made by monks in the tenth century, and watches in the fourteenth. Musical notes were written in the twelfth century, and organs were made at the same time. And there were three other inventions to which he would call special attention. First there was the discovery of gunpowder: second, the mariner's compass, and, third, the art of printing -- and all these in the Dark Ages. [Applause.] Gunpowder itself had changed the face of the world. It had changed entirely the art of war. Formerly men rushed at each other with the sword, and the struggle ended only with the life of one or the other of the combatants. Since the discovery and use of gunpowder in war, the average of deaths in battle had not been one to five. Then, was it not owing to the discovery of the mariner's compass that they were sitting there that night? -- was it not by the manner's compass that new lands were discovered -- that this land of ours became known to Civilization, and our great Republic reared. [Applause.] Where could they point to an invention that had been as gigantic, as grand in its good results? The electric telegraph was a great invention, but it could not compare with the mariner's compass. Then, the art of printing, which was said to have been understood as early as the 11th century, might well outweigh in importance all the inventions since the Reformation. [Applause.] He would ask what the condition of Europe was at the time of the Reformation? Why, it was the second Augustine Age. It was in that age that ERASMUS cams forth in his brilliant, classical style, to lash vice, and sometimes virtue. It was then that other ornaments of literature arose and mind was improving; and it was then that the so-called Reformation came, and set men to grumbling and fighting, instead of improving. In the first great literary epoch -- the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries -- Catholic Spain produced a CERVVNTES and Catholic France excelled in literature, but it was not until the eighteenth that England produced her ADDISON and others. And Germany made no advance until the middle of the last century. Talk to him of the light that had been shed over the earth by the blessed Reformation. [Applause.] Under the third division of his discourse he spoke of civil liberty, the current theory in relation to which was, that it did not exist during the so-called Dark Ages. In the first place, there was the Crusades, which in the twelfth century did what had not been done before they united Europe. It was then that the maxim was laid down which had been so well spoken by our own WASHINGTON -- ""United we stand, divided we fall."" And it was to Pope URBAN that they were indebted for that. [Applause.] It was Pope URBAN who told assembled Europe: ""You are wasting each others lives, while the Mahomedan is marching upon us."" It was Pope URBAN who told them to bury their enmities and unite that the Cross might be strong against the Crescent -- and they gathered beneath the Cross and triumphed. If we were not Mahomedans or the children of Mahomedans we owed it to the Popes and to the Crusaders. The very possibility of being free, then, we owed to the Popes. [Applause.] It was when BARBERASSOA came down upon Italy that the Italians called on the Pope to save them, which he did by driving the Northmen back again over the Alps. It was then that free cities and Republics sprang into existence, which were subsequently, under the name of liberation, menaced by the first NAPOLEON; and he feared that the liberty of the present NAPOLEON was nearer akin to the liberty of the first than the relationship of the present NAPOLEON to his uncle. [Applause.] The Republic of San Marino had stood for 1,500 years in the centre of the Papal dominions, and under the protection of the Popes, and he doubled much whether now that little Republic would like to trust itself to the protection of the present NAPOLEON. In conclusion, he said England had her Magna Charta and Runnymede, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the principle of no taxation against the consent of the people, three hundred years before the Reformation; while with it arose the first Absolute Monarchies and standing armies. And, finally, he claimed that in the best of our own Generals of the Revolution as many Catholic names would be found as any other. The Reformation, he said, had never founded a Republic; the most that could be said of it was that it had a share in founding ours.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/29/archives/civilization-before-the-reformation-a-lecture-by-right-rev-dr.html,,"Right Rev.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/29/archives/the-genesis-of-crime-lecture-by-rev-henry-w-bellows-dd.html,,"Rev. Dr. BELLOWS delivered a lecture last evening, by invitation, upon the subject indicated in the title, before the Brooklyn Sanitary Association, at the Tabernacle Church of Rev. Mr. BARTLETT in Fulton-avenue. After a few remarks by Dr. BELL explanatory of the objects of the Association--the promotion of the public health of Brooklyn--the lecturer was introduced to a large and respectable audience by ex-Mayor HALL, the President. Briefly apologizing for his inability, through want of time, to prepare an address more pertinent to the objects of the Society, he said he proposed to speak of crime subjectively -- its origin in the qualities and infirmities of our nature; inquiring not merely how it does arise, but how it must arise under certain conditions, while our constitution remains constant to itself. Man is a creature of universal wants. ""I want"" -- ""I want,"" is the ceaseless cry of the human organization; and with every want supplied, new wants arise. Satisfy the stomach, and the palate puts in its claim, and that is ten times more difficult to satisfy; satisfy blind cravings and seeing desires arise; satisfy curiosity and you arouse inquiry; indulge inquiry and you awaken speculation; meet wants, and you are called upon to meet wishes, and then fancies, and then whims; feed mind, and imagination opens its mouth; feed imagination, and you arouse the poet, the artist, the seer -- all notoriously hungry creatures, crying like so many Italian beggars for food. Thus man is a Chinese ball of wants within wants, only the ball is ever larger as you go inwards. But the wants of man arouse his powers. Want is the consumer, power the producer; and although wants and powers are on the whole well enough balanced in the world at large, yet they are by no means well balanced in the individual. There is a natural reluctance in man to rectify this inequality between wants and powers. Humanity tries every device to satisfy its wants by some other means than by putting forth its powers to supply them. It tries to consume without producing; it begs, borrows, steals, before it works, and this simply because wants, being older than powers, and having first lived on gratuity, hold to the natural prejudice that they are entitled to a free living. Thus in spontaneous climates man is spoiled, because Nature is over kind. In the earlier stages of social being, wants are kept down by reluctant powers; there is little evasion of labor, because no superfluity of want. There is, therefore, little crime, which in its essence is a desire to escape effort. If, then, in civilized society, where alone crime is greatly possible, we can find out who work and who do not work, we can determine who are the criminal class, for we know the non-workers must either beg, borrow, steal or starve. Now there are three classes of persons who do not work. First, the incapacitated -- the children, the aged, the sick, and the insane. Second, the independent or priviliged non-workers -- heirs of wealth accumulated by their ancestors. This class represent work that is already done, and live on labor that anticipated their leisure. They are not wrongful wasters of what properly belongs to society; and, although it is doubtless a serious misfortune to belong to this class -- since those who need not work to live, live but in the feeble enjoyment of their energies, appetites and capacities -- yet we cannot fairly make these privileged non workers the source of criminality. Third, the indisposed or willful non-workers. From this class is furnished the criminal element of society. They also get recruits from every grade of society in which a non-working spirit prevails, even though working habits may from necessity exist. Every person, whatever his position, belongs to the dangerous and non-working class, if his wants greatly exceed his willingness to work. The man who wants to do by speculation what can be properly done only by industry and toil, who would make his luck stand for his service in society, is really a member of the non-working class, and will naturally enough slip into the criminal class, if not swerved from it by pride or position. The criminal element in highly civilized countries, is divided into two classes. First, those who make crime a business, and, second, casual and accidental criminals, resorting to it only when pressed, or betrayed into it by indolence, want, and passion. In the old countries the first class is very extensive. In this country it is not, as yet, discouragingly small. The basis of all crime is the resistance of the savage nature, to the laws, restraints, and conditions of social existence. It takes two forms, assaults upon persons and upon property. In its essence, however, there is only one crime, which is robbery. It consists in taking social rights without paying for them -- whether it be the right to property, or the right to life, security, and peace. Society says, ""Pay for what you want, and want only what you pay for."" But in what coin? In labor. which is the only current coin in the social mart. Half the social education of a good citizen consists in learning not to want what he can't pay for. Some things cannot be paid for -- the right to take life, to injure the person, to molest the peace, or to corrupt society. But most of the wants of man can be paid for in labor. Labor has been elevated by the Creator to the rank of a virtue. Christianity has made it a sort of prayer. The speaker dwelt at length upon the rights and duties of the citizen in society, and also the duties of society to the citizen. When society fails to find employment and sources of happiness to the citizen, they find a criminal. From stagnant powers is bred the violence of society; from stagnant affections the vices and immorality; from stagnant sympathies the malice, hatred and revenge -- a very social Cain. Abel was a good citizen, because he had the respect and esteem of society. Cain was a murderer, because from his birth he was an outcast.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE GENESIS OF CRIME.; Lecture by Rev. Henry W.
