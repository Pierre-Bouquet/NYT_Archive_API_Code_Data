"The fear of secession, our correspondent telegraphs, was not so strong yesterday at the Federal Capital as it had been previously. Many of the Southern members of Congress who have arrived, have brought their, families, which is considered as indication that they intend to remain.

The opinion appears to be pretty generally received that early in the session, before the assembling of the South Carolina Convention, the leading Republicans in Congress will bring forward some measure calculated to reassure the South, which, if it will not prevent the secession of South Carolina, will at least prevent any other State from following her. Indeed, it is asserted that a compromise measure is actually in the course of preparation, which, will cover the entire sectional issue, and leave no State the shadow of an excuse for wishing to leave the Union. It is now stated that Secretary COBB will not resign his position in the Cabinet until after the assembling of Congress and the delivery of the President's Message. It is expected that Messrs. COBB, FLOYD and THOMPSON, will then issue a manifesto disclaiming the sentiments of that document, and that this will lead to a rupture with the President and other members of the Cabinet.

The debate was finally postponed. Yesterday, the Legislature chose Presidential electors. The Breckinridge ticket received 173 votes, the Bell ticket 54, and the Douglas ticket 8 -- about 70 members not voting. We publish this morning a variety of correspondence and newspaper extracts bearing on the subject of secession, which will be found highly interesting.

"Our dispatches from Washington this morning will be found exceedingly interesting, in view of the fact that Congress assembles to-day. It is understood that the President's Message will not be delivered until to-morrow. This delay is thought best by Mr. BUCHANAN, in order to allow time for the preparation of some measure of compromise, before the exciting topic of secession shall be introduced by the reading of his views upon the subject. The President will, it is asserted, deny the right of any State to secede, but will admit that there is no power in the Constitution to force her to remain in the Union, and will declare his purpose to veto any force bill should Congress see fit to pass one. He will not recommend a general Convention of the States, but will suggest that such a Convention might concert measures to restore quiet. Meantime, it is believed in some quarters that a plan of permanent reconciliation will come from a committee of both Houses, to be composed of a Senator and a Representative from each State, to whom shall be submitted the President's Message without debate, and who shall report an amendment to the Constitution, to cover, all the ground of difficulty. This plan, however, may be defeated by the Secessionists, who have, it is understood, already prepared a resolution, which will be presented to-day, declaring the right of a State to secede at will. Such a resolution would undoubtedly be overwhelmingly rejected, which would give the South Carolina members a pretext for withdrawing immediately, when they might be followed by those of other States. There is undoubtedly, however, a strong Union sentiment among the Southern members. Such men as LEACH of North Carolina, BOULIGNY of Louisiana, ANDERSON of Missouri, ADAMS and BURNETT of Kentucky, and NELSON and ETHERIDGE of Tennessee, are open in their condemnation of the secession movement. It is expected that the Republicans will make an attempt to push the Appropriation bills through before the discussion commences, and for this Mr. SHERMAN, the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, is fully prepared. Senator DOUGLAS was complimented with a serenade on Saturday evening, and took the occasion to express his most unqualified condemnation of the secession movement, and his unalterable devotion to the Union. He declared his intention to bury all animosities, and labor only for the preservation of the country. This declaration has had the effect of rallying around him many who have quite recently been his bitter enemies. Our dispatches from various points in the South do not vary much in their character from those previously received.

The team was what is known as a stone truck, and was drawn by ten horses. Swung to the truck was a piece of marble about nine feet long and three feet square at the end, weighing about sixteen tons. The truck-master, instead of crossing the centre of the bridge, as advised, attempted to cross on one side. As the team got upon the draw, the chains supporting it gave way -- the draw sank down one side, and upset the truck and four horses into the river. A man in charge of the wheel-horses had one of his legs broken in two places, by getting caught between the team and rail of the bridge. He was attended by Dr. S.K. SNELL, who does not consider his injuries of so serious a character as to be necessarily fatal. The horses were got out of the river alive, but all of them were more or less injured -- one or two seriously. The cart and stone are yet in the river, and it will be a nice job for somebody to recover them. The Company owning this bridge is defunct, it is said, but there is a toll-house on the spot, and it is understood that the toll-taker keeps the bridge in repair for the fees he receives. An interesting legal question may grow out of this case, as to who is responsible for damages, should the owner of the team feel disposed to sue somebody. This bridge has never been considered a very strong one; but as soon as the team was capsized yesterday, the draw sprung back into place, so that travel over it was not interrupted. It sags a little on one side -- that is all.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56a5fbaa-77e2-5126-9f30-4c55e0f65ce9,865,nyt://article/56a5fbaa-77e2-5126-9f30-4c55e0f65ce9,

"The President's Message was delivered to both Houses of Congress yesterday at noon, and we print the document in full elsewhere. In the House, after the reading of the Message had been concluded, Mr. SHERMAN moved its reference to the Committee of the Whole. Mr. BOTELER, of Virginia, however, desiring to present a resolution, the motion was withdrawn, and the resolution read. It provided that so much of the Message as relates to the present perilous condition of the country be referred to a Special Committee of one from each State, with leave to report at any time. Mr. MCCLERNAND, of Illinois, moved an amendment, rehearsing the causes of difficulty, and proposing that the Committee be instructed to report by bill, or by amendment to the Constitution, and more particularly as to whether any further legislation is necessary to insure a more prompt compliance with that provision of the Constitution relating to the rendition of fugitives from service or labor. Mr. BOTELER, however, declined to accept Mr. MCCLERNAND's amendment, and also one offered by Mr. SHERMAN, proposing that the Committee be limited to fifteen. At the suggestion of several members Mr. BOTELER modified his resolution by striking out the words ""with leave to report at any time;"" after which Mr. MORRIS, of Pennsylvania, proposed an amendment, which was also rejected, pledging the members to sustain the Union at all hazards. The ground of objection to this resolution was that Mr. BOTELER's resolution was distinctively before the House. After various other suggestions, none of which were thought available, a vote was taken on Mr. BOTELER's proposition, and it was adopted, 145 to 38. Before the vote was announced, a number of Southern members, who had not voted, gave their reasons for declining, which were generally that their States had called Conventions to consider the same questions proposed to be discussed by the Committee, and that the people would decide them for themselves. Mr. MILES, of South Carolina, went further, however, and declared that his State was out of the Confederacy, except as to the there form, and that therefore her delegation took no interest in the question. The House did nothing else of importance, and adjourned at 3 o'clock. In the Senate, after the reading of the Message, Mr. CLINGMAN, of North Carolina, in moving its publication, opened the discussion upon the disunion question, and expressed strong secession views.

"Hon. J.R. FLOYD, Secretary of the War Department, reports that the actual and authorized strength of the Army remains substantially the same as last year. The troops available for service against the Indians have been engaged in campaigns of the greatest activity, and the Army has been constantly in the field, and upon an active war footing. The Department of Texas has been restored to tranquility; the Rio Grande frontier from Fort Fillmore to Fort Brown is well protected, and a very active campaign has been carried on against the Kiowa and Comanche Indians, upon the head waters of the Arkansas and the Canadian, resulting in breaking them up and dispersing them in every direction. To chastise the Indians in New-Mexico a large part of the troops have been stationed in Utah southward to New-Mexico, and there seems to be every prospect that they will meet with the punishment which they deserve. Allusion is then made to the battle with the Pah-Utes in Carson Valley, in which Mr. ORMSBY was killed, and to the subsequent overwhelming defeat of these Indians by Col. HAYS. The Snake Indians in Washington Territory, on the road between Forts Bridger and Walla-Walla, have been hostile during the past season, and have not yet been reduced to subordination. All these operations have been carried on when the appropriations were made only to maintain the Department on a peace footing, and have rendered necessary an unforeseen expenditure of about half a million dollars. Secretary FLOYD urges the necessity of restoring the superintendence and control of the Indians to the War Department, since it is impossible to keep them in subjection in any other way than by a display of military power. He thinks much might be saved to the Treasury by devolving on officers of the Army duties which are now discharged by others at high rates of compensation.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/06/archives/the-war-department-report-of-hon-jr-floyd-secretary-of-war.html,,"Hon.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/06/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The question of disunion was still further debated in the Senate yesterday. After some unimportant preliminary business, Mr. GREEN, of Missouri, introduced a resolution instructing the Judiciary Committee to inquire into the propriety of establishing an armed police in border States, to maintain the general peace and to execute more effectually the Fugitive Slave law. On motion of Mr. CAMERON, of Pennsylvania, it was made the special order for Monday next. This resolution was suggested by the new troubles which have broken out in Kansas. Mr. HALE, of New-Hampshire, then moved the reconsideration of the vote by which the President's Message was ordered to be printed, and proceeded to comment in severe terms upon its inconsistencies. He thought the President should have pointed out some rule for guidance in the present difficulties. He had failed to meet the question boldly, and now the only thing which can avert a civil war is a resort to the ballot-box. Mr. HALE was followed by Mr. BROWN, of Mississippi, who considered disunion inevitable, and by Mr. IVERSON, of Georgia, who declared that five States would be out of the Union before the 4th of March; that the true policy of the Slave States was to leave the Confederacy, and that no power under Heaven could prevent it. He believed that the next twelve months would find the Southern Confederacy the most prosperous and powerful which ever existed. Mr. IVERSON's language was very violent, and special pains were taken by him to declare that the seceding States would be ready to fight for the position which they would seek to assume: Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, hoped the Message would be printed, and deprecated threats. Mr. WIGFALL, of Texas, asserted the right of each State to act for itself, and compared the violation of the laws by the States to the breaking of treaties by foreign powers. He declared his inability to comprehend the purport of the Message, and believed that the President would precipitate the very trouble which he intended to avoid, He concluded by declaring his intention to introduce at an early day a resolution to ascertain whether any order had gone out from the Departments in reference to Federal authority in those States proposing to secede. Mr. WIGFALL was followed by Mr. SAULSBURY, of Delaware, who made a strong speech for the Union. He declared that Delaware was the first State to adopt the Federal Constitution, and would be the last to countenance any act calculated to lead to a separation of the States. His remarks were warmly applauded. On motion of Mr. HAMLIN, the Senate adjourned at 2 1/4 o'clock. In the House, the secession question was not touched upon. Mr. GROW succeeded in calling up the Homestead bill, and it was finally passed, 132 against 76. The Pension Appropriation bill, and that for the support of the West Point Military Academy, having been reported by Mr. SHERMAN, from the Committee of Ways and Means, were also passed.

"Robert E. Curtiss and others vs. Geo. Marshall. -- This cause came on for trial in May, 1860, before Judge WOODRUFY and a jury, in which the plaintiffs recovered the sum of $500 for a refusal on the part of the defendant to perform his contract. A motion for a new trial was argued at Special Term. It before Judge HOFFMAN, and the motion denied. It appeared on the trial of this cause that Hiram Curtiss, in the Spring of 1857, made a contract with defendant by which Marshall was to receive at his lumber-yard in this City, and Curtiss was to deliver 100,000 feet of pine lumber, to be delivered during that year as Marshall should require, monthly. During the Spring and Summer of that year 38,000 feet were delivered under this contract, for which Marshall gave his notes. During the Fall Marshall desired Curtiss to suspend delivery for a short period. Curtiss, it appears, had on hand 60,000 feet of lumber for delivery to the defendant.

Curtiss and others vs. Geo. Marshall. -- This cause came on for trial in May, 1860, before Judge WOODRUFY and a jury, in which the plaintiffs recovered the sum of $500 for a refusal on the part of the defendant to perform his contract. A motion for a new trial was argued at Special Term. It before Judge HOFFMAN, and the motion denied. It appeared on the trial of this cause that Hiram Curtiss, in the Spring of 1857, made a contract with defendant by which Marshall was to receive at his lumber-yard in this City, and Curtiss was to deliver 100,000 feet of pine lumber, to be delivered during that year as Marshall should require, monthly. During the Spring and Summer of that year 38,000 feet were delivered under this contract, for which Marshall gave his notes. During the Fall Marshall desired Curtiss to suspend delivery for a short period. Curtiss, it appears, had on hand 60,000 feet of lumber for delivery to the defendant.

"THE HOMICIDE OF LEONARD GANDER. -- Coroner SCHIRMER yesterday investigated the circumstances connected with the affray which occurred on Sunday evening last, at the lager-bier saloon No. 142 Essex-street, when LEONARD GANDER, a young German, residing at No. 148 Essex-street, was mortally wounded by another German, named XAVIER HOCKREITER. It appeared from the evidence that GANDER and some friends had been carousing together in the bier saloon, and that the former went out for a few moments upon the sidewalk. Presently his companions heard angry words passing between him and two other men named XAVIER and CHARLES HOCKREITER, father and son, who came along the street. What occasioned the dispute, however, did not transpire, and when the other persons came out of the saloon, XAVIER HOCKREITER was chasing GANDER around a wagon, which stood in the street, and finally succeeded in stabbing him with a dirk-knife which he carried in his hand. HENRY KLOTZ, one of GANDER's friends, ran up to assist the latter, and he knocked HOCKREITER into the gutter. CHARLES HOCKREITER then went to his father's assistance and struck KLOTZ, who also knocked him down, but he regained his feet and stabbed his antagonist. The police by this time came up and arrested the HOCKREITERS who were taken to the Station-house, and the injured men were conveyed to their respective homes, GANDER's death occuring on Tuesday morning from the effects of the wound. Dr. BOUTON made a post-mortem examination of the body and found that deceased had received a stab in the left side, cutting into the stomach, and sufficient, in his opinion, to cause death. The jury declared upon the evidence that deceased had died from exhaustion, consequent upon hemorrhage from the wound, and charged XAVIER HOCKREITER with having inflicted the injury with some instrument to them unknown. The accused was then committed to the Tombs, pending action by the Grand Jury. He said that he was a native of Germany, 47 years of age, and a turner by trade. With reference to the charge, he stated that it was not true that he had inflicted the stab, as he had no knife to do it with.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/08/archives/ejectment-from-property-formerly-a-public-highway-superior-court.html,,"Austin Shuman vs. Michael McKeon. This is an appeal to the General Term of this Court, from a judgement in ejectment. The action was originally tried before Judge Pierrepont, under whose direction the jury found a verdict for the defendant. The original action was to eject the defendant, as lessee of George Harrison, from certain premises on the southeast corner of Bleeoker and Grove streets, in this City. It seems that these premises were originally a part of Grove street, and that in 1836 proceedings were taken by the corporate authorities of this City to open a public place between Grove, Christopher and Fourth streets, and to improve Grove-street, between Fourth and Bleecker, by widening the same on the northerly side, and by closing a part of the said street on the southerly side. Application to the Supreme Court was made for that purpose, and Commissioners were appointed, who made their report in 1837, by which, among other things, it appeared that a gore of land lying in Grove-street, on the southerly side, (including the premises in question,) was required for the purpose of being closed, and vested the same to the use of the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City. The Commissioners assessed the Corporation for the land so taken, (including the premises in question,) in the sum of $5,125. The property at the time of this proceeding was in the possession of one Oakley, and by subsequent grants it finally came into the possession of George Harrison, to whom the corporation subsequently granted, making his title perfect. It was admitted on the trial that defendant was a lessee of Harrison. It appeared on the trial that the lot in question lay in the public street after its widening, and before Oakley got his title to the adjoining land. It is contended by counsel therefore that whatever interest in this lot he ever had must have been derived solely from the fact that he was the adjacent owner. Oakley, it is contended, was divested of the title to this property in two different ways, first by the foreclosure of a mortgage which he had given to the executors of one Gerret Gilbert. In March, 1839, however, Oakley conveyed to one David H. Robertson whatever interest he had in the premises. It appears to be well settled, as contended by the counsel for respondent, that the fee of the street as far as the middle is vested in the owner of the adjoining lot, and that the same title will pass to the grantee, unless expressly excluded by the terms of the deed. In this case there do appear to be words in the grant to Harrison which would seem to exclude the street, and it seems that in the grant of Oakley to Robertson these premises are described as the same which were granted to him by the Manhattan Company. It is, therefore, contended that if the defendant is not entitled to possession, or if the plaintiff rejects and denies the effect of the proceedings to close a portion of Grove-street, the gore in question is remitted to its former state of a public highway, and the plaintiff has shown no right to possession thereto, Decision reserved.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Ejectment from Property formerly a Public Highway.; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.

"The quiet neighborhood of Twelfth-street, near University-place, was profoundly shocked yesterday morning by the discovery of a murder which has seldom been paralleled in circumstances of atrocity, boldness, mystery and horror. The victim is Mrs. SARAH SHANCKS, a widow who, for many years past, has kept a small lace, embroidery and furnishing store in the Fifteenth Ward. She was a native of Boston, about 50 years of age, but much younger in appearance and in manner. Among her acquaintances she was esteemed as a person of good reputation, and her daughter is the wife of Mr. WILLIAM SMEATON, principal of the Fifteenth Ward Grammar School. For about a year past she had occupied the lower part of the two-story frame building No. 22 East Twelfth-street as a store and residence. By thrift and economy in the management. of her business she had accumulated a few hundred dollars, most of which, however, she seems to have unfortunately lost through over-confidence in the honesty of some male acquaintances. It appears from what has been learned of her history, that Mrs. SHANCKS was susceptible to flattery, and through this weakness of character had been more than once made the dupe of designing men, who, under professions of regard and promises of marriage, had persuaded her to loan them the savings of her industry. Generally, she has had a girl living with her to assist her in business, who occupied the same sleeping apartments, but for some days past she had been living alone Recently she lost the sight of one eye from sudden cold, and had since been partially disabled from business, during which time she obtained her meals from a boarding-house near by, and her food was brought to her by a little girl, a daughter of one of the neighbors.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/08/archives/another-metropolitan-mystery-appalling-murder-in-twelfthstreet-a.html,,"The quiet neighborhood of Twelfth-street, near University-place, was profoundly shocked yesterday morning by the discovery of a murder which has seldom been paralleled in circumstances of atrocity, boldness, mystery and horror.

"Upon the presentation, last year, of the Annual Report of the Secretary at War, we took occasion to comment upon the rapid and inexcusable growth of expenditures in that department of the public service. From a fraction less than $12,000,000, as they existed in 1851, they had risen to a fraction less than $30,000,000; and, upon examining the objects upon which the money was lavished, we predicted that if the same ratio of progression continued, before 1865 they would reach the enormous sum of $60,000,000; or two-thirds of the entire outlay of the Government. We are happy to state that the tendency to increase has at least been suspended. The present report of Mr. FLOYD indicates that the figures have fallen from $28,000,000,in 1858-59, to $19,000,000, in 1859-60 -- a saving of one-third. It is true, the expenditures for the three months ending Sept. 30, being the first quarter of the current fiscal year, ascend to about $6,500,000, prefiguring an enhanced aggregate for 1860-61; but before this year expires the present Administration will have retired from office, giving place to successors who will be bound by every consideration of self-interest to bring the expenses of the Government far within the limits indulged by the actual Cabinet.

We have the satisfaction of knowing that he received a similar reception from a number of prominent firms on Chambers-street.

Messrs. _____, No. -- street sell their diamonds and jewelry to the South -- have made their money out of Southern merchants, yet Mr. _____ votes for ABRAHAM LINCOLN for President, Mr. ______, of the above firm, told us that he wanted the 'Southerners money.' Will our Southern friends still continue to lavish upon this Black Republican house their money? Mark this house. In our January edition we intend to publish every Black Republican house in New-York that sells to the South."" To the surprise of this enterprising publisher the exhibition of this document did not have the least effect on the nerves of his victim. The merchant coolly informed him that he had missed his mark entirely; that he had no fear of such threats as he was making, and that he would not allow his advertisement to go in the Guide on any terms. At this unexpected rebuff the publisher remarked, ""Well, if you are not with us you are against us,"" and left the store. We have the satisfaction of knowing that he received a similar reception from a number of prominent firms on Chambers-street. If the roll of bills which he boastingly displayed to some on whom he called, were not largely counterfeit, he must have found some weak-minded merchants, who forgot that this dodge has been tried so frequently that Southerners by this time know perfectly well that money is the touchstone by which these black and white lists are made up. Those who feel any interest in ascertaining who refused to respond to this swindler's claim for money are referred to the January number of the Guide, where they will find them figuring as Black Republicans.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Old Dodge Revived.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Old Dodge Revived.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea1ad40a-d5b6-5185-b99a-9534fd176e7a,467,nyt://article/ea1ad40a-d5b6-5185-b99a-9534fd176e7a,

During the adjourment of Congress speculation turns upon the House Special Committee on the Condition of the Union, and the probable course which will be pursued by it. It seems to be generally understood that the members of the Committee will act simply as spokesman for their respective delegations, and under their advice. It is believed that all those appointed on the Committee will serve, with the exception of HAWKINS, of Florida, and BOYCE, of South Carolina. The other members from the extreme Southern States will not decline to act, although they have been strongly urged to do so. As indicating the exact condition of affairs in South Carolina, and corroborative of the statements in the private letter which was published in the TIMES of yesterday, the views of a planter and slaveholder of that State, at present in Washington, will attract attention. He believes that the State will inevitably secede, but that she will Just as inevitably come back into the Union again in a short time, when the leaders in the present revolutionary movement will find that they have signed their own death warrants. This gentleman, our correspondent says, is a member of the Legislature and a delegate to the State Convention. Our dispatches from the principal points in the South continue of about the same character. The disunion feeling in Texas seems to be approaching a culmination. A circular has been issued by a member of the Legislature, calling upon his fellow, members to meet sometime in January whether Gov. HOUSTON chooses to call them together or not; and it is asserted that the Governor has signified his willingness to do so, provided he can be satisfied that a majority of the people of the State desire it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc717446-d9d0-5485-9216-eb6a65fbcae9,1258,nyt://article/fc717446-d9d0-5485-9216-eb6a65fbcae9,

A large majority, according to our correspondent, considered it too late to save the present Confederacy, but they expressed the belief that a new one would be speedily formed. They do not seem to have given any opinion as to the basis on which it would be constructed. Persons recently arrived at Washington from the South report the excitement there as intense. At Charleston, if we are to believe the statements which reach us, a misunderstanding has already arisen between the Federal authorities and those of the city or State. Major ANDERSON, commanding Fort Moultrie, has been refused the privilege of sending to the Arsenal for supplies, and his messengers have been sent back without them, simply because among the articles desired were some percussion caps. The Government, it is understood, has been appealed to to send an additional force, as Major ANDERSON has at present only sixty or seventy men, poorly upplied; but the Administration has absolutely refused to do so. In connection with this refusal, vague rumors prevail that a formal notification will soon be given by South Carolina that she intends to capture the fort, when the Government will order it to be evacuated without a contest, to avoid a civil war. Of course, it is impossible to tell how much truth there may be in such rumors. Secretary COBB, it is asserted, has already resigned, and will vacate his post to-day -- in which case it is believed he will be followed by the Representatives from South Carolina and others. There is one thing, however, which may serve as a check upon too hasty action, and that is the character of the advices from England. The sympathy expressed there for the Federal Government, on the reception of the first reports of the secession movement, somewhat surprises the Disunionists, and they have no hesitation in saying that it is not what they expected. As a measure of financial relief to the Government, the House Committee of Ways and Means, it will be seen, have resolved upon the issue of Treasury notes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ef582ef-4d28-58e3-9453-80acef71c8ca,1029,nyt://article/2ef582ef-4d28-58e3-9453-80acef71c8ca,

The wagon was struck by the locomotive and completely demolished, and Mr. STURMAN was thrown some distance. Upon being taken to the drug store near the corner of Washington-street, Dr. QUIDOR was called, and upon examination, found that the left arm was badly crushed between the elbow and shoulder, and there was also a bad scalp wound on the back of the head, six or seven inches in length. After the wounds were dressed the injured man was sent home, and it is thought will recover, although it is possible that he may lose his arm. Mr. S. states that he neither saw nor heard the train, nor heard any whistle sounded or bell rung. It is also stated that there was no flagman at the crossing at the time of the accident. The horse had his left fore leg broken off at the ankle and one eye put out, and in this condition the poor animal was allowed to remain in the street for a number of hours.

"Novels are numerous this week, and the pile upon our table is pyramidical. First on the list, because the most bulky of the brood, comes Harrington, written by a prolific author, and published by THAYER & ELDRIDGE, of Boston. The book is entitled A Story of True Love; but a glance at the opening pages prompts the conviction that A Story of True Terror would have been its better name. What could the author have been thinking of when he dedicated such a volume to his wife? If that unfortunate lady be of a nervous temperament, she has our heartfelt sympathy. We trust the tale has never been unfolded in the family circle, since its effect on the younger members would certainly be disastrous in the extreme. Slumber would be driven from their eyes for an indefinite period of time, and chains and whips would, rattle about their ears instead. Even the youngest and best loved ""pledge"" would shudder so convulsively that its cradle would need no other rocking. The scene of the story opens at the South, and the plot throughout is skewered together with the iron terrors of Slavery. In the initial chapter we are introduced to a planter and an overseer, who only lack tails of being Satanic -- to an abused wife and a tortured negro. The horrors which such a concatenation of elements evolves in the course of five hundred and fifty odd pages will suggest themselves to the most unimaginative mind, and save the trouble of reading the book. A nonreader, however, will lose some very rare specimens of stilted style and lofty description. Thus, in chapter XVI., where we have glimpses of the moon after this fashion: ""The gibbous moon hung midway down, the zenith over the vast and sleeping city, a lob of spectral light in the cold, blue heavens, over a fantastic brood of dreams."" If the poets who are given to apostrophising Dian and projecting odes at the Pale Queen of Night, ever consent to forgive this man who styles her a ""lob of light,"" they are a more forgiving race than is generally supposed. ""Lob of light,"" is good. But to speak seriously on a serious subject, the evils of Slavery are many and manifold enough to be discussed in sober truth. When imagination ventures to deal with them a very prudent hand must guide the open, or the writer defeats his own purpose, since many who reject the preposterous pictures of fiction will not thereafter be disposed to believe even the plain and simple truth.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/11/archives/new-publications.html,,"Novels are numerous this week, and the pile upon our table is pyramidical.

The suspected person had arrived upon an emigrant train from this City, and several employes at the railroad depot, who had been informed through the newspapers and by telegraph, of the tragedy, observed him leave the train. As there were bloodstains upon his clothing and bandages upon his hands, it was suspected that he was the fugitive murderer. His confused manner and strange actions also increased the suspicions which had been excited, and, after a little consideration on the part of the persons at the depot, it was decided that his arrest should be effected. Accordingly, the town constable was sent for, and the man was taken into custody. After his apprehension, his hands were examined, and they were found to be badly lacerated -- the wounds being such as might have been caused by the broken bottles which the assassin of Mrs. SHANCKS had shattered upon her head and face. The prisoner was closely questioned by his custodians with reference to his knowledge of the murder, and his answers were such that little doubt is felt of his guilt. He stated that he was generally known by the name of ALFRED BUCHANAN, and that he had come to Susquehannah to see one THEODORE SPRINGSTEEN, with whom he was acquainted, and at his house he wanted to stay on Sunday night. He told many different stories about the manner in which he received the injuries to his hands -- but he finally admitted that he had committed the murder. When he made this admission he cried bitterly and said that he knew he should be hung. He added that his mother had told him he had better give himself up as that would be the best he could do for himself, but that his father had advised him to escape from the City, and he had adopted the latter course. Capt.

Believing him to be drunk, the Policeman conveyed the man to the Police Station, where he was placed in one of the cells. Next morning the attendant, on going to the lock-up for the purpose of arousing the prisoners, found that BENATUS could not be awakened, and a closer look at him showed that he was dead. Coroner SCHIRMER was notified to hold an inquest, and subsequently a post-mortem examination having been made, it developed the fact that the man had died in consequence of a terrible blow upon the head which had fractured his skull. As soon as the cause of death had transpired, Capt. SILVEY dispatched officers to inquire as to the manner in which the injury had been given. In prosecuting their investigation, the police yesterday ascertained from JAMES AIRY, a boy nine years of age, that on Saturday night, about 7 o'clock, while making purchases in the grocery and liquor store No. 11 Albany-street, kept by a man named PHILIP COLLINS, he saw deceased there, quarrelling with the proprietor of the place, who struck him upon the head with a club. COLLINS was, therefore, arrested, and subsequently a sailor named HENRY SMITH presented himself at the Station-house and made a statement corroborating that of the boy. He said that deceased and himself had called at COLLINS' store to drink, and a dispute arose with reference to the price of the liquor. After bandying words for some time, COLLINS finally snatched up a club and struck deceased upon the head, knocking him down, while he, (SMITH,) fearing for his life, ran out of the place and went to his boarding-house, without waiting to see how much his companion had been injured. In addition to the arrest of COLLINS, the apprehension of his wife and other parties, who are said to have been present when the affray occurred, was ordered by Capt. SILVEY, and these persons are in confinement. The Coroner will go on with the investigation to-day.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MURDER OF A SAILOR.; The Alleged Perpetrator in Custody.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MURDER OF A SAILOR.; The Alleged Perpetrator in Custody.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4fbb17fe-02c0-5aae-884f-bac894eb379b,355,nyt://article/4fbb17fe-02c0-5aae-884f-bac894eb379b,

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. If there were any consistency in an operatic public, it would seize with avidity the opportunity to hear a gay and lively opera like ""Stradella,"" on a wet and dreary night like that which awaited its production yesterday evening.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/11/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- If there were any consistency in an operatic public, it would seize with avidity the opportunity to hear a gay and lively opera like ""Stradella,"" on a wet and dreary night like that which awaited its production yesterday evening. But base considerations of dampness and discomfort have their dire influences, even when it is clearly proper to check them with the pleasant antidote of a jolly and agreeable work in one of the brightest opera-houses of the world. Thus it happened that there was a bad attendance -- a very bad attendance -- indeed, altogether too bad for hopeful reflections. We will turn, instead, to the performance, which was excellent ""Stradella,"" although not so popular with the masses as ""Martha,"" is in many respects a superior work. It contains an abundant supply of melody, several well-developed ensembles, and any quantity of strongly-flavored and more or less musical rhythms, which, if they fail to catch the ear, are sure to employ the heel. The plot, too, although lackadaisical in some respects, is enlivened with a vigorous vein of rascality. Barterino and Malvolio are agreeable villains, and much more acceptable than many of their betters. They were impersonated excellently last night, by Mr. FORMES and Mr. QUINT. The other parts were rendered most efficiently. Mme. FABBRI -- who seems to be equal to the entire repertoire -- was admirable; and we have seldom heard Signor STIGELLI to greater advantage than in the second and third acts of this opera. Indeed, in all respects the performance was more than an average one, and, under the genial circumstances of a good house, would have commanded a repetition. As it is, we think it might safely be reannounced. DONIZETTI's opera of the ""Daughter of the Regiment"" will be played here on Wednesday, with a cast which may be regarded as absolutely perfect. It is seldom that this agreeable work can be heard with three such artists as FABBRI, STIGELLI and FORMES.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62f6264f-46f8-556e-91c2-02ff57a26f76,330,nyt://article/62f6264f-46f8-556e-91c2-02ff57a26f76,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/11/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The session of Congress, yesterday, was attended with far less excitement than we were led to anticipate, from the tenor of our dispatches of Sunday night. The discussions upon all topics connected with the subject of secession were conducted with calmness, and altogether a decidedly better feeling was exhibited on every side. In the Senate, the Standing Committees of the last session were continued; Mr. LATHAM's resolution relative to the Overland Mail was referred to the Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads; a memorial from THADDEUS HYATT, presented by Mr. SUMNER, relative to the suffering people of Kansas, was referred to the Committee on Territories; and the Homestead bill was read the first time. Mr. POWELL, of Kentucky, then called up his resolution, presented on Thursday, relative to the present condition of the country, and made a few remarks expressive of his views. Mr. COLLAMER, of Vermont, made a motion, which was agreed to by Mr. POWELL, to strike out everything from the resolution excepting that which referred to Federal affairs, and that it be referred to a Special Committee. During a discussion which intervened, Mr. LATHAM, of California, said that his State would remain with the Union under all circumstances -- intimating that she could otherwise never secure that great desideratum, a Pacific Railroad. Mr. FOSTER, of Connecticut, said the management of the country for the present was with the Democrats, but he should support the resolution. Mr. DOUGLAS hoped that there would be no more talk of party until this grave question was settled. Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, did not regard the proposition as one promising a good result. Several other speeches were made on the subject, among which was one by Mr. DIXON, of Connecticut, who combatted the idea that it is impossible for the two systems of free and slave labor to exist in the Confederacy, and the Senate adjourned at a late hour. In the House, Mr. HAWKINS, of Florida, proceeded to give additional reasons for asking to be excused from serving on the Special Committee on the Perilous Condition of the Union. He concluded by a warning that Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were certain to secede, and to be followed by Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. The tone of his remarks, however, was rather more moderate than was expected. Mr. VALLANDIGHAM, of Ohio, in a rather ill-conceived speech, argued in favor of excusing Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. MCCLERNARD, of Illinois, was unwilling to excuse him. Mr. SICKLES, of New-York, believed that the power to deal with the pending political question rests with the Republican Party, and he desired that the Legislatures of the Northern States might be convened in order that they might deal with it. The vote, on Mr. HAWKINS' request, was not taken, -- the discussion being interrupted by the introduction, from the Committee of Ways and Means, of a bill authorizing the issue of ten millions in Treasury notes, for the relief of the Government, The bill was passed after a brief debate, and the House adjourned.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/caab42e4-59ee-54e9-8907-47d55ceea191,1968,nyt://article/caab42e4-59ee-54e9-8907-47d55ceea191,

"The slave bark Cora arrived at this port on Saturday, and anchored at the Navy-yard at 4 o'clock P.M. The day of the week and the lateness of the hour of arrival prevented the formal surrender of the prize and of the prisoners to the United States Marshal. Accordingly, Sailing master EASTMAN and his officers, who came home in charge, retained nominal custody of the vessel and of the three mates, intending at the first opportunity on Monday to hand them over to the United States authorities. What amount of restraint, if any, was practiced towards the prisoners during the day does not appear, but at night they were placed in close quarters below. FREDERICKS, the first mate, was locked in a stateroom on Sunday night. On Monday morning when the door was opened it was discovered that he was gone. It is stated that he made his exit through the port-hole or side-light which ventilated and lighted his state-room. That he should have attempted so hazardous an experiment as to swim ashore in the icy state of the water, seems incredible, but, it is said, no strange boat was seen alongside during the night. The vessel is anchored some two hundred yards from the nearest wharf. A small boy was passed through the hole, which is considered as evidence that the prisoner might have gone that way.

The day of the week and the lateness of the hour of arrival prevented the formal surrender of the prize and of the prisoners to the United States Marshal. Accordingly, Sailing master EASTMAN and his officers, who came home in charge, retained nominal custody of the vessel and of the three mates, intending at the first opportunity on Monday to hand them over to the United States authorities. What amount of restraint, if any, was practiced towards the prisoners during the day does not appear, but at night they were placed in close quarters below. FREDERICKS, the first mate, was locked in a stateroom on Sunday night. On Monday morning when the door was opened it was discovered that he was gone. It is stated that he made his exit through the port-hole or side-light which ventilated and lighted his state-room. That he should have attempted so hazardous an experiment as to swim ashore in the icy state of the water, seems incredible, but, it is said, no strange boat was seen alongside during the night. The vessel is anchored some two hundred yards from the nearest wharf. A small boy was passed through the hole, which is considered as evidence that the prisoner might have gone that way. Report of the escape was made to the authorities, and Marshal RYNDERS, during the day, took WILSON and OLSEN into custody, and they were committed to the Tombs.

"The investigation relative to the circumstances connected with the murder of Mrs. SARAH SHANCES, on Friday last, was resumed yesterday before Coroner JACKMAN, at the Fifteenth Ward Station-house. Two o'clock in the afternoon was the hour which had been fixed upon for the inquest to go on, and long before that time a great many persons had assembled to hear the testimony, or to obtain a sight of ALFRED BUCHANAN, the young man who is in custody on suspicion of being the murderer. The prisoner was brought into the room about 2 1/2 o'clock, and his appearance caused a deep sensation. Accompanying him were his father and brother, both of whom remained at his side until the close of the proceedings. As soon as the young man took his seat, he buried his face in his hands, and for some moments sobbed bitterly; then becoming more composed, he looked vacantly around him, until the examination was commenced. Afterwards, for the most part, he seemed to take great interest in what transpired, keeping his eyes fixed upon the witnesses as they rendered their testimony. When his mother was called to the stand, he again burst into tears. Upon entering the room, she went up to him, and throwing her arms about his neck, she kissed him several times, then looking him earnestly in the face, she said, ""Oh, my son, my son, God have mercy upon you. If you are guilty, I implore you to confess it."" In reply, he called upon God to witness that he was innocent, repeating the expression two or three times. This scene affected all who were in the room, many being unable to restrain their tears, and frequently during the time that the almost heart-broken woman was giving her testimony, her emotions were such that she would for a time be unable to proceed. Her evidence, and that of the other witnesses, corroborates in the main the report which we published yesterday, with reference to the grounds of suspicion against the prisoner, but no point stronger than the exhibition of his wounded hands, was elicited. No efforts had been made by the Police to ascertain the truth of what the prisoner had said in regard to the manner in which he had been hurt, and testimony on that point being considered important, the case was adjourned until to-day, in order that it might be procured.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/13/archives/the-twelfthstreet-murder-proceedings-before-the-coroner-interesting.html,,"The investigation relative to the circumstances connected with the murder of Mrs. SARAH SHANCES, on Friday last, was resumed yesterday before Coroner JACKMAN, at the Fifteenth Ward Station-house.

"James R. Wolf Kiel vs. The Sixth-avenue Railroad Company. -- This was an action brought to recover damages for injuries received on the defendants' road in August, 1859. There appears to be somewhat of a conflict of evidence in this case. The evidence on the part of the plaintiff, however, appears to slow that the plaintiff and his friend went down Twenty-ninth-street, from Broadway to Sixth-avenue, for the purpose of taking the cars. They saw a one-horse car coming down the avenue and hailed it, and then ran to meet it. The car stopped and both plaintiff and his friend attempted to get on ton; plaintiff's friend succeeded in doing so, but while the plaintiff was trying to get to the top of the car his foot slipped off the step, and was caught and crushed between the wheel and the track. The defendants show that the driver at the time of the accident was engaged in making change for the passengers seated at his side and saw nothing of plaintiff or knew nothing of him until he felt the car jolt as if it had passed over a stone. That the car was then stopped and the plaintiff was found holding on to the car with his foot badly hurt. The evidence shows that the plaintiff is seriously and permanently injured.

The good fortune of our country is an almost unlimited extent of fertile territory, and proportionally great demand for industrious hands to cultivate it. But on the other side, immigration, with attendant ignorance and poverty, gathers together in the large cities multitudes of strong men and hard-working women, who each season lose a certain portion of their employment and become dependent on charity. If a Winter of business revolution or panic occurs, this evil is vastly increased. Each year, people who look beyond the temporary assistance of the unfortunate, ask why they should forever be called upon to fill these leaky vessels of the poor, when there is bread enough and to spare for them, and to be earned by honest labor, in our country districts.

FLETCHER's last lecture the cap-sheaf of the Course, at Cooper Institute, last evening, was as large as those which the announcements of his previous public discourses have invariably called together the exceedingly cold weather to the contrary notwithstanding. Those who gave ear to the caution whispered by the icy Winter's wind, and stayed at home to keep them warm, reckoned without their host. The stirring theme and burning words of the lecturer were (better than a fire, and as he warmed to his subject, he kindled in the hearts of his hearers a more generous flame than that which blazed between the jambs of their own narrow firesides. For ""Italy and GARIBALDI"" was his theme -- the story of Liberty's release and the despot's overthrow. Mr. FLETCHER, after briefly expressing his thanks for the very cordial and gratifying reception which has been accorded to all that he has said by the many whom he has addressed, proceeded to deliver his lecture, of which, barring the pressure on our space, we should be happy to give a more extended report. Peninsulas, he said, had always been seats of power. The causes were evident, In them communication was easy and frequent -- everything tended to concentration. Athens, Rome, Granada thus became great peninsular seats of power. Italy had for ages been a giant crushed and held down by petty despots, as Gulliver was pinned down by the Lilliputians. The Peninsula had been distracted, divided, kept under the sway of petty tyrants. But though through long ages there had been no United Italy in politics, in language and in literature there had continued to be a United Italy. The strong Lombards, in the ancient time, had endeavored to make Italy a united kingdom, but had been overcome by the instrumentality of ""the Papal king,"" as GARIBALDI termed the Pope. Then in the Fourteenth century RIENZI, ""The Last of the Tribunes,"" had conceived the idea of a united Italy, but as soon as he touched the power of the ""Papal King,"" so soon had he fallen. In the seventeenth century the Neapolitan. fisherman MASANTELLO -- one of the lowest class, the Lazzaroni -- aroused by the impositions of a foreign soldiery, struck, conquered, was crowned king, and -- beheaded. His name lived still. AUBER had embalmed it in music, and the people of Italy to-day united in singing the liberty hymns of his opera, the performance of which was interdicted in Russia and Austria, It was but a short time ago that VICTOR HUGO had exclaimed, ""Oh, Italy, Italy, of all that is beautiful, thou art but the shadow of thy former self!"" And, at another time, ""Italy, that has taught the world how to read, to-day knows not how to read!"" But that was changed. The Waldenses -- that people which had never been dignified by the name of Italy -- that people which had been hidden away among the Croatian Alps, and whose motto was ""Lux lucet in tenebris"" -- that despised and persecuted people, had been the feeble instrumentality by which a united Italy had been brought forth. Eighteen months ago the chances of Italian liberty had seemed dark indeed. How had this land rejoiced in seeing Italy united. Should that Italy now see us flying to pieces? There was quite as much prospect of it apparently as there was eighteen months ago that Italy would be united. But the same God who made it a united Italy could prevent us from becoming a dis-United States. [Applause.]",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ITALY AND GARIBALDI.; A Lecture by Rev. J.C.

It Would be a strange coincidence if the same year should witness the accomplishment of Italian unity under a constitutional monarchy and the disruption of a far mightier Union under the dislocating agency of Federal Republicanism. WASHINGTON, like ALEXANDER, troubled in his last days by misgivings as to the solidity of his own workmanship. He had found American patriotism strong enough to brave in a good cause the armies of GEORGE III., but would it be proof against the selfishness of prosperity, the meanness of party and personal interests, the fierceness of provincial jealousies? Could the dignified and statesmanlike moderation of the founders of liberty be transmitted to their successors, or would later growth develop those harsher and vulgar qualities which too often appear in the Anglo-Saxon character? We dare not say that the experiment is yet complete. Two generations have amply sufficed to confirm and transcend the experience of antiquity as to the expansive energies of a Democracy, but its capability of cohesion still remains open to question. At a crisis like the present the centrifugal seems more than a counterpoise to the centripetal force, if we are to take the Southerners at their word. The proud traditions of the great Western Republic, the ties of laws, language, religion and national character, the dictates of a higher and more comprehensive self-respect, and the respect of European Powers, are to be cast to the winds when they conflict with local prejudices and the salaries of a class of gentlemen who took their appointments subject to this uncertainty. The enemies of Democracy have always asserted that it cannot rise to the conception of a great national idea, and that for want of this vivifying principle it carries in itself the germ of its own decay. The opponents of cotton have even denied the assumed liberality of the commercial spirit, and retorted that, if circumstances were changed, merchants and manufacturers would not show less blindness or selfishness than farmers and landlords. It has been reserved for the ""fire-eating"" slave owners of South Carolina and Georgia to verify this taunt, and to seek for precedents of party warfare, not in the history of the United States, but in the continental system of NAPOLEON, in the Berlin Decree, and the English Orders in Council.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISUNION AS VIEWED ABROAD.; HOW ENGLAND AND FRANCE WILL REGARD A SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.

At the expiration of a week he deposited $100 with the book-keeper of the establishment on account of his board, and since that time he had frequently absented himself for a day or two from the house. On Thursday, about 1 o'clock, he summoned one of the servants to his room, and represented that he was very sick. Mr. LELAND was informed of the fact, and he sent for Dr. QUACKENBOSS to visit him.

"Our dispatches from Washington this morning are in the highest degree important. Gen. CASS, in despair at the condition of the country, has resigned his position as Secretary of State. Mr. TRESCOTT, the Assistant Secretary, as has already been announced, resigned on Thursday, -- consequently, the State Department is at the present time without any responsible head. A successor to Gen. CASS has not yet been decided upon by the President, but rumor points to Hon. DANIEL S. DICKINSON, of New-York, as likely to be called upon to assume the responsibilities. It is also positively, stated by our correspondent that Secretary THOMPSON will resign, probably on Monday; and it is believed that other members of the Cabinet will follow. It is even very strongly suggested that President BUCHANAN himself may retire, and leave the management of affairs between now and the 4th of March in the hands of Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. The House Special Committee had another meeting yesterday, but it does not appear that anything of special importance was effected. Mr. CORWIN, the Chairman, submitted a proposition giving the people of a Territory the exclusive right to elect their officers and to make their own laws, subject, of course, to the Constitution of the United States. This, however, was opposed by several of the Republican members, as carrying Slavery into all the Territories under the decision in the Dred Scott case, and, without voting on the proposition, the Committee adjourned until Monday. It is believed that a report will be made early in the coming week, probably on Tuesday. Meantime it is asserted, on what is considered reliable authority, that Senator DOUGLAS intends, on Tuesday, to deliver his expected speech, in which he will take strong ground in favor of coercing seceding States. Mr. WADE, of Ohio, it is known, will take that ground in the speech which he is to deliver on Monday. The effect to be produced by these speeches is a matter of grave speculation. The Secessionists, of course, contend that they will precipitate an immediate collision in South Carolina, and strengthen the disunion feeling throughout the South; but this view of the case is susceptible of some doubt. Advices received in Washington from the Cotton States are somewhat contradictory. Louisiana is represented to be ripe for secession; while in Alabama, which has been strongly counted on to follow South Carolina immediately, the conservatives think they will be able to carry the State. MILES, of South Carolina left for home last night, and the rest of the delegation from that State, it is understood, are to withdraw formally in a body.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/15/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Our dispatches from Washington this morning are in the highest degree important.

It is incredible that he could believe it possible to effect a change in the Constitution, by which Slavery is to be made the fundamental law for all the territories of the Union; and in urging such a proposition upon the attention of Congress and the country, he could only have been actuated by the desire to stimulate the Southern Ultraists to demand what he knew would never be conceded, and thus to increase the difficulty of harmonizing the country. He was aware that the Democratic Party of the nation, in convention at Charleston, in April last, though thoroughly Pro-Slavery, and ready to buy Cuba, or conquer Mexico, in order to extend the system, could not venture to incorporate this proposition of a Slave code for the territories in their platform of principles; and that the Northern delegation, rather than sanction a measure which they knew would overwhelm them with defeat at home, held out against it to the last, though the delegates from seven or eight Southern States seceded in a body. He was aware that this very issue caused the permanent dissolution of the party; that the two factions into which it was divided went into the Presidential canvass under different banners, and with opposing candidates; that a third candidate was before the people, who represented the Southern opposition; that Mr. LINCOLN beat them all by an overwhelming majority; and that Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, who alone was in favor of a Slave code for the Territories, was literally distanced in the race in the Free States by the least formidable of his competitors.

It appeared from what transpired yesterday betore Judge QUACKENBUSH at the Jefferson Market Police Court, that some time since, Ruyter, who is a carpenter, was engaged by Hughes to do some repairing at his house. The bill for doing this work amounted to $3, but Hughes said it was exorbitant and declined to pay it. This fact caused ill-feeling between the men and their respective families, and on Saturday evening Mrs. Ruyter and Mrs. Hughes fought together, the latter while the fray went on receiving assistance from her husband. At a later hour Ruyter heard of what had taken place, and to avenge his wife's black eye, he called at Hughes' house and commenced an attack upon him. Hughes defended himself with a small hammer, and having used the instrument several times upon the German's head, the latter was glad enough to escape the blows by running away. He, however, soon returned, bringing with him a gun, and having dared Hughes to come out of the house, the latter, after a time, presented himself. Ruyter at once fired, the ball taking effect in Hughes' thigh, inflicting a wound of a very serious character. The injured man was conveyed to the Twenty-first Ward Station-house, where Ex-Coroner CONNERY administered to his relief. Officer McBride had meanwhile taken Ruyter into custody, and Justice QUACKENBUSH yesterday sent him to prison.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; SHOOTING A PROCRASTINATING CREDITOR.

Sixtyfive men, under a gallant and loyal officer, constitute its only garrison, and are instructed to hold it against assault. South Carolina has for months threatened secession, in the event of LINCOLN's election, and the seizure of that fort is an indispensable incident of secession. Six weeks before the election a force of three hundred men was collected, for the purpose of being sent to reinforce that garrison; but just as they were ready to start, Secretary FLOYD, -- for reasons which he may possibly explain, -- countermanded the order, and they were sent to California. From that day to this nothing has been done to strengthen the garrison. A month ago Gen. SCOTT addressed directly to the President, an elaborate paper representing the absolute necessity of sending reinforcements to all the Southern forts, and designating the number needed for each, and the posts from which they could be obtained. No notice whatever has been taken of this urgent-recommendation. Col.

She has especially studied the constitution and wants of this numerous class; and, as a result of this effort and practical knowledge, obtained in a lifetime spent as nurse and physician, she has compounded a Soothing Syrup for children teething. It operates like magic -- giving rest and health; and is, moreover, rare to regulate the bowels. In consequence of this article, Mrs. Winslow is becoming world-renowned as a benefactor of her race; children certainly do RISE UP and bless her; especially is this the case in this City. Vast quantities of the Soothing Syrup are DAILY sold and used here. We think Mrs. Winslow has immortalized her name by this invaluable article, and we sincerely believe thousands of children have been saved from an untimely grave by its timely use, and that millions, yet unborn will share its benefits, and unite in calling her blessed.

"The splendid new steamer John P. King, which had just been completed for Messrs. SPOFFORD & TILESTON's Charleston line, made a most successful trial-trip on Monday, preparatory to her going upon the line. She returned from the trip down the Bay at 4 o'clock P.M., and came to at pier No. 4 North River. The peformances of the King gave the highest satisfaction to all who were on board, including her builders, the constructors of her engines and machinery, her New-York owners, and a large number of merchants. Having landed her guests, the vessel was surrendered to the custody of her officers and a watchman for the night, the Captain going to his residence in Brooklyn. At half-past 4 o'clock yesterday morning, the attention of the police on West street was attracted by smoke which was seen issuing from the funnel of the new steamer. The alarm was immediately given, and the persons on board of the King called up. A slight inspection below revealed the fact that the wood-work surrounding the engine-room was in a blaze, the fire having already made considerable headway, and the flames mounting from the forward hatch of the engine-room. The cause of the fire was unknown, but was supposed to have resulted from the over-heated wood-work around the boilers. The nearest hydrant was unscrewed, and by the aid of the steamer's hose a stream of water was poured below, and upon the fire. In a short time the firemen arrived, and brought powerful streams to bear upon it from their several machines. It was soon apparent, however, that the fire was beyond control, and efforts were made to scuttle the vessel. The flames now had gamed fearful headway, and messengers were dispatched to the Union Ferry Company for the assistance of the ferry-boats with their Worthington pumps to aid in extinguishing the fire. The ferry-boat Whitehall was soon alongside, having the steam-engines J.G. Storm and Mary Ann, No. 8, which did good service, the Worthington force-pump from the ferry-boat throwing a continuous and powerful stream into the hatchways of the burning steamer.

When the new Board comes into power, they think, will be time enough for the Mayor to look after the removal of Messrs. SMITH and DELAVAN.

Those who profess to be posted in Aldermanic secrets, openly ridicule the attempt as an absurd and impossible one. The Mayor, they say, cannot get more than four out of the seventeen votes requisite for the removal of Capt. G.W. SMITH; and no matter how many Aldermen may enter his caucus, when it comes to the sharp push of voting, there will be found a solid phalanx of thirteen in favor of allowing things to remain as they are in the Street and City Inspector's Departments, until after the 7th of next month. When the new Board comes into power, they think, will be time enough for the Mayor to look after the removal of Messrs. SMITH and DELAVAN. There was intense excitement yesterday upon the subject, and doubtless the proceedings of the Board this evening will be attended by large outside delegations from the threatened Departments. There is not much immediate fear that the Charley Devlin regime can be restored to power. Those favorable to such a proposition, will (as Ald. BOOLE says,) ""have to watch long before they can prey.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Aldermanic Caucus.; THE STREET COMMISSIONERSHIP AGAIN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Aldermanic Caucus.; THE STREET COMMISSIONERSHIP AGAIN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/048fbaa5-e3af-54bd-a67f-c10ef0b26b05,269,nyt://article/048fbaa5-e3af-54bd-a67f-c10ef0b26b05,

"WINTER GARDEN. -- ""Romeo and Juliet"" was played here last night, Mr. BOOTH sustaining the part of the hero, and a ""young lady of this City,"" that of the heroine. The interest of the occasion centred, of course, upon the latter. Miss ELLIOTT, the debutante, possesses a good figure, fine eyes and a pleasing stage presence; her movements are unembarrassed and graceful. Beyond these requisites, which she brings to a profession demanding these and many others, we noticed much quiet and thoughtful purpose, and a meritorious modesty, which, while it was embarrassing to the lady herself, was not the less her friend with the audience. There is no royal road to acting, and the future excellence which is promised by this initial performance must depend on patient heroism, willing drudgery, tedious minuteness of study, and unflinching strength of purpose. The first triumph has been gained, but scarcely the first victory, for Miss ELLIOTT has yet everything to learn.

"The Alabama Whig publishes an address made at Eutaw, on Dec. 6, by Hon. JOSEPH W. TAYLOR. He argues, in the first place, that the election of Mr. LINCOLN is constitutional, and should be acquiesced in. He can do the Southern States no harm. Separate State secession he condemns in general, because it is disunion of the South, and in the case of Alabama particularly, because, if it were peaceable, the State could not maintain its position as an independent nation. She could set herself up as champion of the peculiar institution, and would draw upon herself the hostility of the nations who are opposed to it. Such a course would furnisn no remedy for the grievances of which she complains; neither would it give her security for the future, or be making resistance to the election of Mr. LINCOLN, or to the aggressions of the Republicans. To speak plainly, such action would be submission, but in a new form, to most grievous wrong and injustice, for she would be giving up, voluntarily, all light and light to her possessions in the Union. These objections apply equally to the secession of a few States. Mr. TAYLOR then proceeds to the consideration of the remedy which is to be found for the grievances of Alabama in the cooperative action of the Southern States. He defines this as ""joint conference and joint action by the Southern States within the limits prescribed by the Constitution."" The first great argument in favor of this is that it seeks a union of the South for the protection of the South. By it all wrongs may be redressed in the Union; or, if it should be refused, the Southern States would occupy a favorable position from which to appeal to the world. Then he thinks that an overwhelming majority of the Southern States and of the Southern people prefer the cooperative policy. Then Mr. TAYLOR demonstrates that this course is not too dilatory, and that it is not submission in disguise. He acknowledges that it may preserve the Federal Union, and this is his reason for urging it. In conclusion, he suggests the following as the basis upon which an effort should be made to settle present dificulties:",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/21/archives/alabama.html,,"The Alabama Whig publishes an address made at Eutaw, on Dec. 6, by Hon.

"Gov. HOUSTON has addressed the people of Texas in a manifesto dated at Austin on Dec. 3. He repudiates the idea which he says has been industriously propagated, that he would submit to the violation of the rights of the people of the State by the Federal Government Because he would not urge a resort to revolution without a cause, he is not to be charged with advising submission to wrong. The people have the Constitution to maintain; and when that fails to give them their rights they may resort to revolution. The fearful calamity of disunion, now impending, calls for the united action of the Southern States, and, in this emergency, the rights of the Border States, which have so long stood as a bulwark against Abolitionism, should be regarded.

The people have the Constitution to maintain; and when that fails to give them their rights they may resort to revolution.

"Loomis Bullard et als., plaintiffs and respondents, vs. Ezekiel S. Lockwood, impleaded with Alexander Lockwood and Thomas Gill, defendants and appellants. -- This action was brought to recover damages for the loss of certain straw goods alleged to have been sold to Gill upon the fraudulent representations of himself and the Lockwoods. The defendant, Gill, was not served in this suit. It appears that Gill's place of business was in the same building with the Lockwoods, who were his references. Thus, it is alleged, that through the representations of one of the defendants to the plaintiffs, that Gill was a man up-stairs, who bought goods at auction on short credit, and sold them for cash to the country trade. That they, (the Lockwoods,) sold him on credit, and that he then owed them $3,000, and had always paid them at maturity. It seems to appear from the evidence on the trial of this cause, that the Lockwoods, as auction and commission merchants, were in the habit of advancing Gill money on his promise to return it or send in goods to cover it, but told him they would rather have the goods, as that was their business. The plaintiff's sale on Lockwood's recommendation was shortly after their reference to him, and the next day their straw goods were in Lockwood's catalogue. Their advances to Gill were all made on goods to be sold by them at auction, and with a margin of from 40 to 50 per cent. It appears that, after this transaction, Gill failed, and this action was brought against the Lockwoods for the causes as set forth above. On the trial a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs against the defendants, who now appeal to the General Term of this Court for a new trial, on the ground of alleged technical defects in the pleadings, -- a defect of parties, -- and that false representations cannot be properly alleged to be made by a firm. The main point, however, appears to be upon a question propounded on the trial to one of the defendants. ""State whether, or not, in the conversation you had with one. Williams in regard to Gill's affairs, you had any intent to deceive."" This was overruled on the trial as inadmissible evidence. The recommendation having been (positive and emphatic, and the plaintiffs having acted on it to their damage, it was irrelevant what their intent was; and the point is further taken by the counsel for plaintiffs, that one who, without knowledge of its truth or falsity makes a material misrepresentation of this kind; is guilty of fraud as much as if he knew it to be untrue.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/21/archives/recommendation-of-solvency-alleged-misrepresentation-common-pleas.html,,"Loomis Bullard et als., plaintiffs and respondents, vs. Ezekiel S.

It was shown by the testimony of R.C. JAMES, second engineer of the steamer, that while the boat was lying to just above Hell Gate, waiting for daylight on Wednesday morning last, the steam chamber of the starboard boiler exploded. Witness was in the engine-room and heard the noise, but not being aware of its cause, he was impressed with the idea that the vessel had run on the rocks. As nearly as he could recollect there were 16 inches of steam on at the time of the explosion. The boilers were inspected on the 2d of May, when a certificate was given that they were capable of carrying 35 lbs. The steam chamber he found, by examination, had burst at one of the caps in the lining of the steam chimney, and the weakness he believed had been caused by corrosion, JOHN FAULKNER, fireman, testified that he had found the deceased, shortly after the explosion, lying, near the galley on the larboard side of the steamer's deck. Deceased was asleep in his room near the exploded steam chamber when the accident occurred. Two other servants were with him, but they escaped uninjured. Witness also picked up several females who were scalded, and conveyed them to the ladies' cabin. On the arrival of the Commonwealth at this City deceased and seven other persons were conveyed to the New-York Hospital. Dr. TUTHILL, resident physician of the institution, testified that deceased had been under his care, and that he died from the effects of scalds, at 3 1/2 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon. The jury declared the explosion to have been accidental.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f40638b-3166-5f68-a9d8-7ef60bc8a48b,1187,nyt://article/0f40638b-3166-5f68-a9d8-7ef60bc8a48b,

The levy upon these goods was made by the Sheriff under attachments against the firm of Colgrove & Co., some time in February, 1856. It appears from the evidence in the case that Colgrove & Co. had bought this store something like a month before the levy, under the following circumstances: A person of the name of Lock, who was engaged in the vending of patent medicines, occupied desk-room with the plaintiff Bowers during the month of September, 1855. During the same month, Colgrove & Co. purchased of a Mr. Walters the store at the corner of One Hundred and Twenty-fifth-street and Eighth-avenue, for about $2,000 -- $500 of which was paid in cash, and the balance in Lock's notes, at from three to twelve months, with Colgrove's indorsement upon them. About two months after this transaction Colgrove & Co. bought another store from Mr. Gibbs, on the corner of One Hundred and Twenty-fifth-street and Fourth-avenue, which is the store in question, paying Gibbs $400 in cash at the time of the purchase, and their notes for the balance at thirty, sixty and ninety days.

These documents were signed by fifty-two members of the Legislature who were in attendance at the meeting. The preamble acknowledges the importance of the crisis, and the resolutions repudiate the idea that either of the Slaveholding States will prove untrue to her own interests or the common cause, condemn the plan of secession first and cooperation afterwards, since it would inevitably create domestic dissension and strife, while consultation would insure the success of whatever plan of redress may be agreed on. The address urges these same views at greater length, and invites the appointment of delegates to a Southern Convention. ""Our people,"" it says, ""must be united. Our common interest must be preserved. Our common movement must be successful. Common dangers must be avoided. Our equality, our honor shall be preserved. All these can devise a cooperation.

A margin would also be left for profit.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A FALSE REPRESENTATION.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A FALSE REPRESENTATION.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bc9d4b48-6211-5785-9bd3-4861286ac5a8,240,nyt://article/bc9d4b48-6211-5785-9bd3-4861286ac5a8,

The tide which they have so long been obliged to stem, now sets in their favor. We rejoice in the increasing popularity of this noble work, as a token of the world's progress; but while we do so, we should not forget the pioneers in the field, who have struggled in the past untiringly, through the obstacles which prejudice has thrown in their way, and whose heroic exertions have effected the change fat public opinion. Conspicuous among the number stands Mrs. WINSLOW, who for more than thirty years as nurse and physician, has followed her profession with unflagging application and industry. During this time she has compounded a Soothing Syrup, for children teething, which ought to immortalize her name. It is the most perfect thing of the kind, in our opinion, ever compounded, and one of the greatest discoveries in medicine of the age; it is of more importance to the human family than any other discovery made by the profession in the last hundred years. Common observation cannot fail to satisfy all who will take the trouble to look into the bills of mortality for any one year, that a very large percentage of children annually die during the process of teething, and a very much larger number of those who survive are greatly debilitated or diseased, so that they grow up weak both physically and mentally, and incapacitated both for study and labor. Now, we appeal with perfect confidence to thousands of mothers who will read this article, to corroborate our statement when we say that no such fatal consequences as those we have alluded to, ever occur from teething, when Mrs. WINSLOW's Soothing syrup is used IN TIME. That it is just the article needed is the testimony which reaches us daily from those who have tried it, and until some member of the Faculty can produce an article which shall equal in excellence the result of the long experience of a Female Physician, we hope we shall hear no more of woman's overstepping her sphere in entering the medical profession. -- Drawing-room Companion, N.Y.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FEMALE PHYSICIANS; REV.

The speech of Chancellor DUNKIN on Wednesday shows that one man at least saw the yawning gulf before the fatal plunge was made, but, swept on by the rushing tide, he made no effort to avert the impending catastrophe. He nevertheless told some wholesome truths to his colleagues of the Convention, the echoes of which seem to have made an impression -when it was too late. He told that body that, if the act of secession were to have the effect of turning the Collector of the Customs out of office, no vessel could leave Charleston freighted with Cotton or other products of the State, except at the risk of being seized as a pirate by the navies of the world; and hence, the commerce and business of the State would be paralyzed, and the people ruined. The resignation of the Postmasters, or the annullment of their official power by the act of secession, would in like manner, he said, seriously derange business by destroying the postal system. In this connection he aptly quoted a saying of MIRABEAU, that ""the fiercest insurrections were those which arose from the stomach."" ""People without bread,"" he continued, ""won't hear reason; their patriotism is dead.

"An entertainment of an entirely novel character is a thing so seldom enjoyed in New-York, that we feel much pleasure in calling attention to the debuts of the ""Zouaves"" on Saturday night at Niblo's Garden. The Zouaves it must be premised are veritable braves of the French army, and owe their present positions to an accidental talent discovered before the walls of Sebastopol, and since cultivated to a point of great excellence. Their piece, the ""Fille Terrible"" was first acted in the Crimea, and during the performance the Russians it is said made a sortie which compelled actors and audience to take to their arms. One of the former dressed in female attire was killed, and others, including some members of the present company, severely wounded. Incidents of this exciting kind brought the Theatre d'Inkerman prominently before the public, and when the war terminated there was a natural desire among civilians to see the men who could thus amuse others in the face of death. A prosperous career in France, and a repetition of the same in London, have brought the Zouaves to our shores, where the name, at least, is popular at this moment; whether the entertainment will be equally so, remains to be seen. The pieces played by our French friends are of the slightest possible character, and for that reason are eminently amusing and laughable. It is known, of course, that the female parts are played by men, but without witnessing a performance, it is impossible to believe how well and ludicrously the external characteristics of the sex are mimicked.

But this did not accomplish all that was needed. The consumers of this produce lay to the northeast, rendering necessary a circuit of some four thousand miles to reach districts separated only by as many hundreds. The people of our own State, consequently, set to work to open another outlet for the great valley -- in effect to turn its great river into their own magnificent harbor. With this view the Erie Canal was constructed; a work of small capacity in the outset, but still sufficient to accomplish vast results, instantly reducing the cost of transporting a ton of merchandise from Buffalo to New-York from $100 to $15.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Months of the Mississippi--Where are They?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Months of the Mississippi--Where are They?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4924cbc-f7ae-5fac-a23c-c75b5d33d293,1592,nyt://article/a4924cbc-f7ae-5fac-a23c-c75b5d33d293,

"WINTER-GARDEN. -- A new version of the immortal ""Rip Van Winkle"" was produced here last evening, and introduced Mr. JEFFERSON in the questionable character of ""a star."" It seems but the other day that we gave welcome to this gentleman as a desirable addition to Miss LAURA KEENE's Theatre, and now we find him alone and cold, and over-wrought, going through, the egotisms of a star engagement. He who was the spice of an evening's entertainment, has thus become the solid meat thereof, and is, we are bound to add, a little tough. Comedians seldom succeed as stars, and the reason is found not in the want of appreciation of fun on the part of the audience, but in the fact that the situations which cause that fun cannot be piled on one man's shoulders. A moment's reflection will convince us that in his new character Mr. JEFFERSON is incapable of reviving any pleasant souvenirs of his former triumphs; hence the necessity for a piece like ""Rip Van Winkle,"" which is in a way now, and demands but a single actor and a variety of supernumeraries. Of its kind it is good enough, but we object to its kind, and regret the occasion which has brought Mr. JEFFERSON from the enviable position of the first stock actor of the Metropolis to the ""lower range of feeling"" of a more comic star. His performance last evening was as good as any man could make it, but the applause was hollow, and will not, we fear, contribute to the fortunes of the engagement. The piece is well put on the stage, and whatever the result, no one can question Mr. JACKSON's judgment in giving us a short holiday taste of merriment after so long a supper of tragic horrors.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/25/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER-GARDEN. -- A new version of the immortal ""Rip Van Winkle"" was produced here last evening, and introduced Mr. JEFFERSON in the questionable character of ""a star.""

"Our readers probably remember the general interest excited three years ago by the mysterious disappearance of young DE FORREST from the Metropolital Hotel, -- and the utter failure of all endeavors to detect any trace of him. He had very respectable connections, was of good habits, and it was impossible to account for his sudden absence. The general belief was that he had been murdered, -- or had fallen into the river during some momentary attack of insanity. The last Australian mail, however, has brought letters which place beyond doubt the fact that he is alive, and in his right mind. His experience, as related by himself, is most interesting, and in a condensed form we present it to our readers. Coming to this City he put up at the Metropolitan Hotel. While there he became oppressed with the feeling that his friends no longer loved him or cared for him, and that they would be glad to know of his death. Having ample means with him he procured a passage to San Francisco under an assumed name, and departed thither, leaving behind him his entire wardrobe and all the money he had over, to the amount of $500. While on the passage, he found to his infinite terror that he was an object of notice from several persons whom he had known in early life as factory hands in his native village, and deeming that he had been discovered, he reassumed his own name and ever after retained it. He landed at San Francisco with nothing to do, with no friends, and without money. Consequently he suffered much, not only from privation, but from the inclemency of the weather, and was heartily glad of an opportunity to earn his board and lodging on a ranch at some distance from the city. Not content, however, with this life, he made a successful attempt at teaching school, and as he was a graduate of Yale College, it is fair to presume he found the employment more congenial. At that he continued a year, by which time he had saved sufficient to enable him to buy a passage ticket for Australia, to which point he had determined at the outset to go. He at once found employment in the High School at Melbourne as a Professor, referring the Trustees to Yale College for his identification. During all this time his mind was terribly exercised and his heart most keenly lacerated by the thought that his friends rejoiced in his departure. Supposing that those who had recognized him on the steamer would have written home, he watched carefully the Eastern papers for advertisements, but seeing none, concluded that he was indeed forsaken by all whose affection he prized.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/25/archives/the-mysterious-disappearance-of-mrs-de-forrest-heard-from-at-last.html,,"Our readers probably remember the general interest excited three years ago by the mysterious disappearance of young DE FORREST from the Metropolital Hotel, -- and the utter failure of all endeavors to detect any trace of him.

"It is evident, from the present state of Italy, that to realize profitable results from a victory indicates more ability than to gain it. It is a fine thing to become ""master of the situation,"" but a much finer to turn it to account.

The two Select Committees on the State of the Union held meetings yesterday, and the results arrived at is the House Committee will probably have an important bearing on the ques tions at issue between the two sections of the country. An ""Enabling Act"" for the Territory of New-Mexico was proposed by Mr. ADAMS, of Massachusetts, and will be adopted, which allows, by express provision, the establishment of the institution of Slavery, provided the people desire it. In the Senate Committee no conclusions were arrived at. An inquiry was made of the Southern members as to whether Mr. TOOMBS' proposition, that the Constitution should recognize the right of property, in man, was to be considered as the Southern ultimatum, but a satisfactory answer could not be obtained. The Commissioners from South Carolina have arrived in Washington, and taken private quarters. It is expected that they will communicate with the President to-day, either verbally or in writing when a message will be sent to Congress, giving the purport of the communication, whatever it may be. The trouble at the Alleghany Arsenal at Pittsburgh, it is understood, is giving the Administration a great deal of uneasiness, and messengers have been sent there, to see what can be done to prevail upon the people to allow the guns to be forwarded to their destination without molestation. The proceedings in open session of the South Carolina ""Sovereign"" Convention were somewhat interesting yesterday. A resolution was offered requesting the Governor to communicate to the Convention all the information in his possession relative to the condition of the fortifications in the harbor of Charleston. It was laid on the table for consideration in secret session. A resolution was offered -- what disposition was made of it is not stated -- that all citizens of the United States living in the State of South Carolina when the ordinance of secession was adopted, be declared citizens of that State. The gentleman who offered the resolution gave assurances that he did not contemplate making involuntary citizens of those who happened to be residing in the State at the time referred to. An attempt was made, to adjourn over until the 18th of January, or subject to the call of the President, but it failed. Mr. RHET[???] offered an ordinance providing for the holding of a Convention of the Slaveholding States, to form a Southern Confederation and frame a Constitution for its government, which he desired to have laid on the table without reading, It was decided, however, that this could not be done, as it would be against parliamentary usages, and it was accordingly read. It provides for a Convention to be held at Montgomery, to be attended by delegates from all seceding States, and recommends the adoption of the Constitution of the United States as a suitable basis on which to form the proposed new Government. The Convention then went into secret session and adopted an ordinance on the subject of Commercial Facilities.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/92f664da-a26e-5a1b-b1e5-43952ced82c4,1540,nyt://article/92f664da-a26e-5a1b-b1e5-43952ced82c4,

"ATTACK UPON THREE LADIES, THREE GENTLEMEN AND A POLICEMAN -- ARRESTS. -- At about 9 o'clock on the evening of the 25th inst., three gentlemen, accompanied by ladies, were walking along Fulton-avenue, and upon reaching Classon-avenue, seven inebriated ruffians made an unprovoked attack upon the party. The gentlemen defended themselves to the best of their ability, but they were unable to cope with the superior number of their assailants. Fortunately, Officer NATHAN SWEETZER, of the Ninth Precinct Police, was near the spot, and promptly went to the assistance of the assailed party. In attempting to arrest one of the most violent of the party, he was seized from behind by two of the ruffians, who held him, while a third twisted the club from his hand. A severe struggle ensued, but Officer SWEETZER, after receiving some pretty severe injuries, succeeded in releasing himself from their grasp. Having lost his club, he ran a short distance, so as to have time to get at his pistol. The roughs pursued him, screeching and yelling, until he got his pistol out, and then he turned upon them. The three pursuers then became the pursued. He chased the ruffians pretty sharply until he found that all were likely to escape, when he commenced firing his pistol at them. Four barrels were discharged without doing any serious damage, when the officer secured one of the party and took him to the Ninth Precinct Station. There the prisoner furnished the officer with the names of those who were with him, and warrants were issued for their arrest. Another of the party was arrested yesterday, and the missing ones will probably be secured within a short time. This is the second time within two weeks Officer SWEETZER has had a severe encounter with ruffians in this District, and received severe injuries. On the occasion previous to this he attempted to arrest three men who were fighting. They turned upon him, knocked him down, beat and kicked him until they supposed he was insensible, if not dead. But he was only playing ""possum."" As soon as they started to leave, Officer SWEETZER, quite refreshed, sprang to his feet, knocked down the nearest man to him, seized a second, and conveyed the two to the Station-house. The third man escaped.

It is presumed that he was not specially pleased at the removal of Mr. PLATT, with whom he had a prolonged interview. Up to 3 o'clock of yesterday Mr. DEVLIN, the newly-appointed Chamberlain, had not filed his bonds, but on Wednesday afternoon he presented himself at the Mayor's office to be sworn in. Col. BURNHAM, to whom the application was made, declined to fill up the constitutional oath, bill tendered a blank form, which being filled up by a friend at hand, was signed and sworn to before the Acting Mayor. The mere act of taking the oath does not, however, confirm the tenure of office, the filing of the bond being by some deemed a necessary preliminary to the assumption of office, where security is required. Mr. Devlin will file his bond to-day, and that they will be ample to meet any amount which the City or County may require, will not be denied. Mr. Platt, however, does not intend to resign his office and its perquisites as readily as did his predecessor. He holds the purse-strings of the City, and the purse contains at present over four millions of dollars, -- which is certainly worth a law suit, especially as, in any event, the City must foot the bills.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""MAYOR'S OFFICE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""MAYOR'S OFFICE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-12-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e189e2b6-084f-5b21-afb3-a8cafa5809af,348,nyt://article/e189e2b6-084f-5b21-afb3-a8cafa5809af,

"A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN ATTEMPTS TO ELOPE WITH A YOUNG MISS -- THE PLANS FRUSTRATED -- MARRIAGE. -- Quite an excitement was caused in Jersey City on Saturday, amongst certain circles, consequent upon an attempted elopement of a young Southern gentleman with a blooming young Miss of fifteen Summers, an adopted daughter of Mr. ISAAC WOOLFE, of No. 17 Grand-street. Mrs. WOOLFE, who is the sister of an Ex-Judge in New-York, is said to have planned the elopement without the knowledge or consent of her husband, and very nearly succeeded in her plans. The knowledge of the affair coming to the ears of a friend, he at once repaired to Williamsburgh, where Mr. WOOLFE is engaged constructing a city railroad, and informed him of what was about to take place. Mr. WOOLFE hurried at once to Jersey City, and consulted with Counselor JELLIFFE, when it was decided that he should proceed to the ferry and wait for the runaways. Hardly had he arrived there when a cart, containing a large box and some trunks belonging to the Southern gentleman and his fair one, came up. After some talk it was decided, in order to prevent the matter becoming public, to have the baggage removed to Mr. GAFFNEY's stable, there to await further action. The indignant father, the gentleman from the Sunny South, and Mr. JELLIFFE, then repaired to the office of the latter, and two hours were occupied in consultation. The father was very angry -- refused to be reconciled to the union, and it is said, used some very strong language. The young Southerner protested that his intentions were honorable, and in the elopement affair he was merely carrying out the plans laid by Mrs. WOOLFE. Mr. WOOLFE was finally prevailed upon to give his consent to the marriage, which he did after examining the baggage. The box contained an outfit, consisting of bedding, &c., which had been furnished by Mrs. WOOLFE, and the trunks the young lady's wearing apparel.

The evidence showed that deceased and JOHN O'FLAHERTY, a sailor belonging to the above vessel, went ashore on Christmas Eve to make some purchases for presents to a girl named RANDELL, living in Maine, to whom deceased was engaged to be married. After making the purchases, and on their way back to the vessel, they met five young men, unknown to them, who attacked them, and after knocking down and brutally beating the deceased, they robbed him of $40 in money, and then ran off. O'FLAHERTY was also struck by them, but managed to escape without serious injury. The deceased lay upon the pavement nearly all night insensible, and the following morning was found by the police and taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he subsequently died of his injuries. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the above evidence, and after they were discharged, Officer IRVING, of the Twentieth Precinct, brought in a young man named JEREMIAH FLYNN, on suspicion of being one of the five who murdered SUTCLIFFE. He was immediately identified by O'FLAHERTY as one of them, and locked up to await examination.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/12/31/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Our dispatches from the Federal Capital this morning are again of a highly important character, and indicate still further complications in the already sufficiently entangled knot of difficulties. Secretary FLOYD resigned his position as the head of the War Department on Saturday, the resignation to take effect immediately. Although this event has been anticipated, still the ostensible cause for it has been unexpected. It seems that the movement of Major ANDERSON in evacuating Fort Moultrie and occupying Fort Sumter, was directly contrary to the spirit of assurances which had been given by Secretary FLOYD, with the President's consent, to the authorities of South Carolina, that no change should be made in the disposition of the Government forces in the fortifications in Charleston Harbor, until the State Commissioners could arrive in Washington and have a hearing. As soon as the action of Major ANDERSON became known, the Commissioners called upon Secretary FLOYD for explanations. Mr. FLOYD disavowed the act, but the Commissioners, would not be satisfied with anything short of the withdrawal of the troops from Fort Sumter. This, it appears, Secretary FLOYD was willing to agree to, and he accordingly asked the permission of the President to issue the necessary order. The Cabinet had a very long discussion on the subject; but, finally, the weight of the Cabinet being against complying with the demand of the Commissioners, Secretary FLOYD felt himself called upon to resign. It is intimated that Secretaries THOMPSON and THOMAS may resign today; but there appears to be no certainty about it. It is further intimated that President BUCHANAN may, after all, come to the conclusion to comply with the demand of the Commissioners; but this will be considered hardly probable under existing circumstances. This demand is understood to be the ultimatum of the gentlemen from South Carolina.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-12-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/276da9b4-081b-5769-808e-033d3811e1fa,1125,nyt://article/276da9b4-081b-5769-808e-033d3811e1fa,
