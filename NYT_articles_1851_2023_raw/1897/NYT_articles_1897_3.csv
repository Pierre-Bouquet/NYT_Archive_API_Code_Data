It was ""The Sketches from the Diary of a Sportsman"" that particularly excited her attention. It was to the Russian novelist that, in 1872, she dedicated her story, ""Pierre Bonnin.""

Mr. Allen severely criticised the trusts and combinations which, he declared, reaped the main advantage of tariff taxes.
