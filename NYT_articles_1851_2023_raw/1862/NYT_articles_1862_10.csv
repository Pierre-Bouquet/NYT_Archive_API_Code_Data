Morgan; Proclamations by NYS Gov,"From the depth of National affliction we come, with stricken hearts and chastened spirits, to own our dependence upon the Most High, and to render, with grateful sense, our thanksgivings for His mercies, countless in number and infinite in extent. A year fraught with the heaviest sorrow has yet, in the merciful plan of Providence, been distinguished by the most conspicuous blessings. Although it is numbered among the dark periods of history, and its sorrowful records are graven on many hearthstones, yet the precious blood shed in the cause of our country, will hallow and strengthen our love and our reverence for it and its institutions, while the bitter sorrows of the year will discipline us into humility. Whatever was passionate in the earlier period of the war has given way to a deep and subdued conviction of duty in defending the integrity of the Union. Reflection has made clear our obligations, and the issues of the momentous struggle present themselves in more definite form. Our National aims have been elevated, and our sacrifices have made us less selfish; our Government and institutions placed in jeopardy have brought us to a more just appreciation of their value. Looking beyond the wicked leaders, who have precipitated this great calamity of civil war upon us, we see that the people in arms against the Government possess the higher qualities of our national character, and though their minds have been perverted by passion and prejudice, yet on many occasions their prowess and devotion to their cause have been such as to win our respect. We are permitted to see that the war is developing the manhood of the nation; and when peace shall return, we have faith that the American Republic will be more powerful, the Government more permanent, the elements of society more perfectly blended, and the people more firmly united than ever.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THANKSGIVING IN NEW-YORK.; Proclamation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THANKSGIVING IN NEW-YORK.; Proclamation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Thanksgiving Day', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'BY Edwin D.

Many persons may be inclined to doubt the truth of this report. From the operation of numerous causes, the rebel Government, if left to its own resources, seems in no condition to strengthen its naval arm. Already, according to official statements, fifteen millions of dollars have been wasted in the vain attempt. And the chief result in which the enterprise has culminated, is to prove that ricketly old hulls, roofed with railroad iron, and armed with a beak, are not the highest possible ideal of naval architecture in the nineteenth century. For their terrible rams, and other novel sea-monsters, have contracted an awkward habit of injuring themselves as much as their opponents, or of foundering in the most unhandsome manner, and going to the bottom when least expected.

"Two months of the operation of the Tariff Act of 1862 have passed and no diminution in the amount of duties received has yet been apparent. The estimate mark, when the last Congress was in session, that the duties could be made to reach the sum of $100,000,000 for the next fiscal year proves not to have been nearly as incorrect as many then prophecied it was. On the supposition that the new tariff would yield the above-named sum the law was framed and the Tax bill passed. The statement that under its operation the amount received would approach that sum was dorided in Congress by some members, and was thought by many to be extravagant. It appeared probable that if the war should continue, the importations would diminish, and in consequence, the receipts for duty be less instead of greater than before. It did not seem rational to believe, when the condition & the country was already unfavorable to the importation of foreign goods and merchandise, that the passage of a tariff law levying higher duties than the ones already imposed, would increase the receipts. It appeared last Spring and Summer as though the importing trade must suffer on account of the encouragement afforded domestic manufactures, and from the unsettled state of the country. But strange to say, though the nation has been and still is involved in its most gigantic war, the people seem to have plenty of money and to expend it more freely than ever in purchasing articles of foreign growth and manufacture. The receipts at our Custom-house in July were unparalleled, but for this there was a good reason, namely, that importations were increased in anticipation of the new Tariff, to take effect on the 1st of August, and that the withdrawals of goods from bond to escape the new duties were very great. It appeared evident to all then that the next month must be a dull one, that the importations must be small, and the receipts greatly inferior to those usual at that season. It did not seem in the least probable that importers would make large purchases abroad at the beginning of the operation of the new tariff, especially when they had been afforded ample opportunity to anticipate it and enter such goods as they were in need of under smaller rates. It seemed that the importations must be small till the stock already on hand should have been consumed. But when the month had passed, the official returns showed that the receipts, though inferior to those of July, were nearly $5,000,000 -- a sum larger than that received in any month of 1860 or 1861. But a reason could be assigned for this by those who believed that importations must decrease. The new tariff had been in operation only one month, and the heavy receipts might have been due to the arrival of goods shipped by owners who believed the merchandise could reach this country before the 1st of August. Falling in this, the new duties must be paid; this reason could have been assigned with some appearance of validity, but another month has passed, and instead of falling off, the receipts have been greater than in August. For September, they were about $5,300,000.

Wise men ventured to question the prediction. There Was plausible reason for believing that an accessof irritation in that quarter was simply an impossibility. Popular passion had been wrought up to so extreme a pitch, that another degree of elevation was unattainable; and besides, the ignorant whites who compose the bulk of the population, had so often been assured that the sole object of the war was to free the slaves, that an official announcement to that effect, signed and sealed by ABRAHAM LINCOLN, would hardly excite a fresh emotion.

The programme was selected with excellent taste and judgment, and gave general satisfaction and delight. Mr. GOTTSCHALK played three pieces on the piano in his most dashing, sparkling manner, of course receiving enthusiastic applause and demands for repetition. As a finale he performed for the first time, a burlesque on the French air, ""Marlbrook,"" better known to the American student of harmony as ""He's a jolly good fellow."" This plan of finishing up with something having a dash of lively humor in it is one of the most attractive features of Mr. GOTTSCHALK's system. In the programme on Thursday were two classical works, admirably executed by Messrs. NOLL, REYER MATZKA and BERGNER, a Fantasia for the violin by Mr. THEODORE THOMAS, an exquisite cornet solo by LOUIS SCRIBNER, and singing by Mrs. JENNY KEMPTON and Mr. J.R. THOMAS. Mr. J.R.

Dispatches from Washington,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/05/archives/obituary-2-no-title.html,Dispatches from Washington," -- Edward O. Wright, Second Lieutenant in Company H. Fifth Regiment New-York State Volunteers, (Duryea's Zouaves,) died in the Fairfax Seminary Hospital, near Alexandria, on Sept. 26, of a wound received in the second battle of Bull Run, Aug. 30. Lieut. Wright enlisted as a private in the Seventy-first Regiment, N.Y.S.M., on April 20, 1861, but as he was among those whom that corps was obliged to reject, because it was so full when it left this City for the seat of war, he enlisted, on April 22, in Duryea's Zouaves, which was then forming. During the stay of the regiment at Fort Schuyler, its encampment in the vicinity of Fortress Monroe, and at Fort Federal Hill, Baltimore, he discharged his duties with zeal and fidelity. In the battle of Big Bethel, on June 10, 1861, he bore himself with great bravery and coolness. Although he was always foremost in the succession of battles and skirmishes before Richmond in which the Zouaves won such distinction. Sergt. Wright, for his services in the ranks had been rewarded with promotion, escaped without a scratch, and for bravery displayed in the battle of Gaines' Mills he was made a Second Lieutenant. In the battle of Groveton, or Bull Run No. 2, which was fought on Aug. 30, he was wounded by a Minieball, which struck his left arm near the socket, passed through his lung and finally lodged between his shoulder blades. Could he have received immediate attention his life might have been spared, but he lay on the field until the afternoon of the next day, when the ball was extracted. After submiting to this operation he dragged himself to Centreville, where he was paroled, and thence was sent within the National lines. He was promptly taken to Fairfax Seminary Hospital, but the excellent care which he there received came too late to revive his failing energies, and he died as we have already stated, on Sept. 26. During all his sufferings, which were at times intense, he gave a striking example of patience to those around him. His company, which had become attached to him as few companies are to their commanders, will miss him in camp and on the battle-field,and a wide circle of friends in this City, who knew and appreciated his worth, mourn his loss.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary 2 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary 2 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23d1ee7b-ead9-54b1-a9cd-3fab42f3095c,1057,nyt://article/23d1ee7b-ead9-54b1-a9cd-3fab42f3095c,

As the fated 23d of September drew ominously nearer and nearer, a corresponding desire was developed in hitherto recalcitrant rebel hearts to take the oath of allegiance; and it was observed that most of those who had been the noisiest in denouncing the Government then became the most clamorous to get in ""and take a swear."" But the most notable fact detected by our observant and reflective correspondent was that, as the portentous day approached, the responsibilities attached to taking the oath gradually lessened, until the general sentiment among the Secessionists became -- ""It don't amount to much, after all, and saves us from the effects of the Confiscation law.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Oath-Taking in New-Orleans.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Oath-Taking in New-Orleans.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32533e99-200c-5a31-ab1c-f9e3da8fc944,754,nyt://article/32533e99-200c-5a31-ab1c-f9e3da8fc944,

FLOYD and PILLOW, and from all I have been able to learn since, I am satisfied the information was correct. Among other incidents showing that the enemy had not only reoccupied their former ground, but extended their lines still further to our left, is the fact that OVERTON'S cavalry, following after FORREST'S, was cut off from retreat by an infantry force of the enemy at the point where FORREST had crossed the stream on the river road. When the information of our reinvestment was reported, Gen. FLOYD, Gen. PILLOW and myself were the only members of the council present.

Water will do that which hostile shot cannot; it will slowly, but surelyeat its way through the iron plates which compose the hull so as to fataliy weaken or destroy them ultimately. A method of copper coating these plates has been devised, however, which seems to afford effectual protection from corrosion. Copper is fused and heated to 1,600 degrees, when the iron plates, which are to be coated, are plunged into it and kept there until they are nearly white hot. Then partial fusion between the two metals takes place, and the plates, when withdrawn, are found to be much more effectually coated than is possible by the galvanic process, which has hitherto been employed. The severest tests which it has been possible to make of iron thus heated, have proved that it is perfectly protected from the action of the water, and as the cost of coating is comparatively small, it would seem as though the Government must follow the example of private builders, and adopt this method with the Monitors how in course of construction.

It was not at first accepted by the more ease-loving young ladies with avidity; it appeared eminently unlady like to be throwing bean bags ever each others' heads, and talking loud enough to be heard half a block off; yet the work went steadily on. The Ferris and Packer Institutes can show classes of readers that can speak for themselves in behalf of elocution as an accomplishment second to none. Since it is so new a thing to teach grown-up girls and boys to talk -- to speak plainly, in fact -- it is found impossible to find competent teachers for the charge of such department, and a growing taste is observable among the, more refined to perfect themselves for professorships. A fine opportunity for such students is in store in the readings, dramatic and otherwise, which will be the fashion this Winter. The first of these takes place on to-morrow, Tuesday evening, at Dedworth's lower hall, and will consist of the characterization of the most thrilling passages in VICTOR HUGO's great romance, Les Miserables. It is a good idea in our master elocutionist, Mr. VANDENHOFF, to dramatize as it were, and give form and life to the creations of the novelist whose work is in everybody's hands, and in everybody's mouth both in this country and in Europe. We shall have rekindled the enthusiasm with which all must read the scenes so truly drawn. We shall have Monsteur Myriot, Jean Val Jean, Jabert, Marius and the rest to live and breath before us. It will be a study worth the while of those who clamor for a vocal gymnasium, which great necessity for each and all our schools, must shortly be supplied, but first we must have well qualified teachers.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Taste for Vocal Gymnastics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Taste for Vocal Gymnastics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/334e32f7-5ea4-5f47-8fd4-a72de49a34b7,322,nyt://article/334e32f7-5ea4-5f47-8fd4-a72de49a34b7,

Attempts to revive them elsewhere have ended in disastrous failure, and Mr. WALLACK again finds himself, without further risk of competition, sole master of the field which they afford for the display of strongly characterized acting. At WALLACK's almost any piece is rendered enjoyable by the positive ability with which it is performed. Even the slowest example of the fossil standard-drama can be galvanized by Mrs. HOEY, Mrs. VERNON, Miss GANNON, Miss HENRIQUES, Mr. MARK SMITH, Mr. FISHER, Mr. GILBERT and Mr. LESTER WALLACK into liveliness and temporary brilliancy; and there are pieces of ancient origin, beside, which possess a good deal of inherent vitality. Other pieces, not new, but comparatively modern, (of the ""standard class,"" though,) have attractions of their own; yet the public cannot be induced to regard them with favor, except when they are presented by Mr. WALLACK, with the completeness which he alone, of all managers, seems able to achieve and maintain. This fact has been proved, beyond dispute since the commencement of the present season, and, in all probability, the question will not be very soon agitated again. To a great many people novelty would not be unacceptable, if for no other reason than that of affording the admirable performers just named opportunities of appearing in original parts; but Mr. WALLACK cannot be expected to go to the trouble and expense of putting fresh pieces on the stage when those he has in stock are sufficient to fill his theatre every night. He indicates the preparation of something new, it is true, and we shall no doubt know what it is all in good time. For a week or two longer, however, a continuance of the old comedies is announced, and large enough audiences will be thereby influenced to warrant their repetition.

The present object, however, is the control in the Tammany General Committee. The CONNOLLY party claim the Chairman, ELIJAH F. PURDY, and a majority of the Committee (which is composed of 121 members) as their supporters. They say the choice of delegates to Albany proved their superior influence. The BOOLE party say no contest was made on that point, but that they triumphed at the meeting of the Committee last Thursday night, by reversing, for the first time in the Chairmanship of Mr. PURDY, one of his derisions, and in deciding upon an enlarged and elected Committee of Conference instead of one appointed in the Committee on Organization.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; THE WAR IN THE CITY HALL.

It was built for the Warren railroad, being part of the line of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad, and was commenced in 1854, by RUTTER & DU PUY, contractors, and was finished some months since, by Messrs. MCALLISTER & WIESTLING, both of the latter having been interested in the work since the commencement. The rock is of a syenitic formation, and during the progress of the job almost every form of underground operations proved necessary. From the hard, seamless rock, offering the most stubborn resistance to construction, every degree of formation was encountered, to quicksand, with an unusual quantity of water.

SPENCER, formerly a merchant of this city, but for the last two years a resident of Savannah, Georgia, which place he left a week ago last Friday, arrived here two days ago in the United States transport George C. Collins, and has kindly favored us with the following authentic information with regard to the present condition of affairs in that rebel city. The population of Savannah, usually about 25,000, is at present something less than 15,000, and business is almost at a stand still. Two out of five of the stores and other places of business are closed, and those remaining open have a very meagre stock of goods, and are doing next to nothing in the way of trade. The blockade of the city he considers almost perfect, and does not think it worth while for the Government to spend another cent to make it more effective. All manufactured and imported goods are extremely high, and scarcely to be had at any price. Ordinary boots bring $30 a pair, and $20 is charged for footing old ones. Coats worth in New-York $15, bring from $40 to $50, and pants from $20 to $25. Tea is worth $10 per pound; coffee 75 cents; butter $1, and other things in proportion. Flour is $42 a barrel, with a limited supply on hand, as the wheat crop of that region has proved almost a total failure. The crop of corn, however, has been good this season, and it is now selling in Savannah at 50 cents a bushel; though, previous to the gathering of the new crop, it brought $2. There is great suffering among the poorer classes of the city, and their prospects for the future are daily growing worse, as the contributions of the wealthy for the support of the soldiers' families, which were freely given at the beginning of the war, are now greatly diminished, from the inability of the contributors, and from the fact that many of them have been themselves forced into the army through the conscription act. The conscription has been very thorough, and almost every ablebodied man, from 18 to 35, is now in the army. The second conscription, which is to include all between the ages of 35 and 45, had not been enforced when Mr. SPENCER left, but he thinks it will add one-third to the fighting force of the Confederacy, which he estimates at present to be about 400,000 effective men.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MATTERS AND THINGS IN SAVANNAH.; Present Condition of the City Defences Completed and in Progress The Floating Batteries ""Georgia"" and ""Fingal"" Obstructions in the River-Feeling of the People with regard to the War Probable Effect of the Emancipation Proclamation,etc., etc.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MATTERS AND THINGS IN SAVANNAH.; Present Condition of the City Defences Completed and in Progress The Floating Batteries ""Georgia"" and ""Fingal"" Obstructions in the River-Feeling of the People with regard to the War Probable Effect of the Emancipation Proclamation,etc., etc.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5ff85cd-bfa2-5b59-8a2a-3f1e3a592070,1691,nyt://article/a5ff85cd-bfa2-5b59-8a2a-3f1e3a592070,

But let us see how he condemns the rebellion. ""We charge,"" says Mr. SEYMOUR, ""that this rebelbellion is most wicked, because it is against the best Government that ever existed."" That starts off very well. It seems explicit and emphatic. But Gov. SEYMOUR proceeds to enlarge upon the point. ""Rebellion,"" he says, ""is not necessarily a wrong; it may be an act of the highest virtue."" Possibly, then, there may be some extenuation for this rebellion. ""To resist a bad government is patriotism, -- to resist a good one is the greatest guilt."" Here, then, is the test which Mr. SEYMOUR proposes to apply. If our Government, in its actual and practical workings when the rebellion broke out, was a good one, then the rebellion was wicked. If not -- not. Now what has Gov. SEYMOUR to say on this point? ""Our Government and its administration are different things; -- but in the eyes of the civilized world, abuses, weakness or folly in the conduct of affairs go far to JUSTIFY RESISTANCE.""

Editorial on current military movements in Kentucky sees no cause to fear for Nashville safety,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/08/archives/safety-of-nashville.html,Editorial on current military movements in Kentucky sees no cause to fear for Nashville safety,"There is, we think, a wholly unfounded apprehension entertained in some quarters of the safety of Nashville, Tenn. It is assumed that Gen. BUELL, by marching his army to Louisville and getting in front of BRAGG, left the way open by which he entered, and that BRAGG had only to move back over the same road and fall with crushing force on Nashville, now stripped of its usual defensive force. It seems to be overlooked in this view of matters, that Gen. BUELL did not leave the road unprotected that he marched over. On the contrary, not only Nashville, but Munfordsville and Bowling Green, two very strong key positions on the road between Louisville and Nashville, are held in force by BUELL's men. From Bowling Green we had an account yesterday of reconnoissances beyond Glasgow, far cast of BRAGG's supposed route back upon Nashville, showing the Union troops to be masters of that line of travel.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Safety of Nashville.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Safety of Nashville.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c3ef439-c117-57d5-9c75-3756a0dc0066,548,nyt://article/4c3ef439-c117-57d5-9c75-3756a0dc0066,

Mr. TOMLINSON thought it would be improper to leave arms permanently in the possession of the citizens, when not in legitimate use, but to store them where they could be readily obtained by the proper authorities, and yet be secure from the reach of violent mobs.

LEE's army is retreating, or preparing to retreat, southward from Winchester; and the statement we obtain this morning from Washington by telegraph, to the effect that Gen. Jo. JOHNSTON is moving a large rebel force over the Rappahannock in the direction of the Manassas Gap Railroad, and that he has already taken possession of Warrenton, Bristow and other points lately occupied by our troops, does not make it any less likely. It is probably his intention to attempt with his army to capture and hold Manassas, Thoroughfare Gap, and the whole line of the railroad to Strashurgh, which, if once effected, would render a rebel retreat from Winchester to Richmond comparatively easy. Or, if JOHNSTON fails to effect this, he can at least hold Warrenton and the line of the Rappahannock, by which action the rebels would be enabled to cross the mountains by way of Sperryville, and strike the railroad at a safe point south of the Rappahannock. It seems incredible, as some reports say, that the rebels are preparing to move their whole army up the Shenandoah Valley as far as Staunton. Either of the routes to Richmond which we have indicated, and others also, are infinitely more practicable; and if JOHNSTON has as large a force as is stated, it does not seem but that the rebels might conceive that either of them can be made effective. We had supposed, however, that we had men enough in front of Washington to prevent any such attempts on the part of JOHNSTON; and as SIGEL and HEINTZELMAN are, or were a short time ago, in command of them, we know that, so far as they are concerned, all that skill and courage can do will be done to prevent it. In case JOHNSTON attempts to advance any further on his present line, or even if he attempts to hold with force the positions he has just been permitted to occupy, we may soon look for an important action near the scene of our first great battle, and the scene of Gen. POPE's unstrategical manoeuvres. If he be allowed to seize the Manassas Gap road, drive our troops near there forward to Washington, and thus secure a comfortable rebel retreat from Winchester, we shall have to confess that our Washington strategy is sadly at fault.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Signs of Movement in the Rebel Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Signs of Movement in the Rebel Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f34954e3-7a1c-51a7-b675-d8c6ccad5049,723,nyt://article/f34954e3-7a1c-51a7-b675-d8c6ccad5049,

HALLECK does not propose that MCCLELLAN shall pursue it, or that SIGEL and HEINTZELMAN shall block its pathway, we shall take it as an inevitable indication that it is HALLECK's intention to maintain our army on the defensive before the Capital during the Winter. For if, holding the points our forces now do, at Harper's Ferryand at Centreville, it be considered impracticable? to attack with success a retreating army, it will certainly be much less practicable to attack that army when it is stationary and planted behind defensive works at Manassas or at Richmond. The present Autumn weather in Virginia is splendid weather for military work -- good roads, bracing air, bright skies. But, as we said before, it will presently come to a close. Our correspondent at Antietam wrote on Monday last: ""This splendid Fall weather with its invigorating air and excellent roads inviting to activity, will soon give place to storms and muddy thorough fares, which will forbid us to move. By the time the Potomac has been swollen by rains, which will secure 'My Maryland' against another rebel raid, the roads, by the same natural agencies, will have been rendered impassable. We shall then be ready, I suppose, to go into Winter quarters, where the army will waste away by sickness and inaction, and be ready (?) for active operations in the Spring."" We earnestly trust that this will not be the case, and that no such programme has been drawn up by Gen. HALLECK. The country demands action, the army demands it; and if it be delayed till next Spring, we may look forward to another Summer of disasters.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WEATHER FOR WORK', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WEATHER FOR WORK', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97aeae16-7e0e-5c79-93b8-bee8d53e3c31,383,nyt://article/97aeae16-7e0e-5c79-93b8-bee8d53e3c31,

There is nothing the soldiers dread so much as delay nothing they fear so much as inaction and Winter quarters. They leave worked hard during the hot months; they have fought splendidly, and achieved memorable victories. But they, as well as the nation, see and feel that their past triumphs have been indecisive; and they all believe that with brave and wise leadership they can speedily utterly conquer the enemy. ""With them,"" writes one of our intelligent army correspondents, ""time is everything; and with a certain class -- not, I hope, the best or largest -- every hour's delay makes them more and more indifferent as to how the fighting ends, so that it ends. Remove the legal restraint which holds the army together, and half of them would go home to 'see their parents' to-morrow -- the other half would vote to send Commissioners to Richmond, or to welcome propositions from the rebels for winding up the struggle -- rather than drag through another Winter campaign in the swamps of the Chickahominy, or in any other part of Virginia. But give them the word 'Forward,' and with the needful leaders and reinforcements, they will not stop until they have chased the rebels into the Gulf. I mention these things,"" continues he, ""not willingly, but for the purpose of showing the temper of the army, and the absolute necessity of keeping their energies employed and their minds easy."" We trust our gallant and splendid army will not be disappointed in its desires and hopes, but that it will at once be allowed to assume the offensive against a foe over whom, when on the offensive, it has always been victorious.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TEMPER OF THE ARMY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'TEMPER OF THE ARMY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9eb6b003-4439-5a04-92da-b13319558529,301,nyt://article/9eb6b003-4439-5a04-92da-b13319558529,

A large concourse of spectators were in attendance at the opening of the Court, the popular interest in the trial, doubtless, being heightened by the fact, previously announced, that the celebrated English lawyer, Edwin James, Esq., had been engaged for the defence. The District-Attorney, A. Oakey Hall, Esq., appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. James was assisted in the defence by his associate partner, Thos. Dunphy, Esq. Mrs. Real entered the Court-room a few minutes before the opening of the trial, accompanied by three lady friends, all attired in deep mourning. Her friends, with the exception of one lady, who sat with her by the side of her counsel, occupied seats upon the platform, at the right of the Judge's desk. There were several other ladies seated in various parts of the audience, among whom we noticed the popular feuilletonist, Ada Clare, who occupied a chair within the railing. The brother of the deceased, Mr. Real, also occupied a seat within the bar. The appearance and bearing of the prisoner was that of unaffected, not to say shrinking, modesty, and her countenance bore the marks of much and long suffering.

THOUVENEL, concerning the Roman question. It was written as long ago as May last, but has only now been given to the public, when the subject assumes a new and graver interest from the recent movement Of GARIBALDI. The letter, like every literary emanation of NAPOLEON the Third, is full of broad philosophical generalizations, great political liberalism, adroitness, indirection and skill in stating and balancing, without settling, the claims of opposing parties. His policy toward Italy, he avers, has always been the same: ""to second the National aspirations, to invite the Pope to become their support rather than their adversary -- in a word, to consecrate the alliance of Religion and Liberty."" At the same time the new Kingdom of Italy has enemies, and the Holy See also has enemies; the enemies of the new State are ""all men of order;"" the enemies of the Pope are ""all that is liberal in Europe."" It is necessary that the new Kingdom be reconciled with the Pope; and it is the interest of the Holy See that the Pope should be reconciled with Italy. ""This double end would be attained by a combination, which, in maintaining the Pope master in his own domain, would lower the barriers which now separate his States from the rest of Italy."" And the somewhat indefinite imperial conclusion of the whole matter is that on the one hand the Italians shall engage to recognize the States of the Church; and on the other, that ""the Holy Sec. recurring to ancient traditions, should consecrate the privileges of the municipalities and the provinces in such a manner that they should, so to speak, administer their own affairs. Then the power of the Pope, soaring in an elevated sphere above the secondary interests of society, would disengage itself from that responsibility, always heavy, and which a strong Government alone can support.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE POPE AND THE EMPEROR Among our foriegn excerpts,this mornig will be found a very remarkable documen', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE POPE AND THE EMPEROR Among our foriegn excerpts,this mornig will be found a very remarkable documen', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-10-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bc32518b-e910-596e-b592-cc6610228024,846,nyt://article/bc32518b-e910-596e-b592-cc6610228024,

LEE will again attempt offensive operations, or the invasion of loyal territory, this Fall or Winter. The rebels threw their whole available strength into Maryland, and marched up to the very borders of Pennsylvania; but they were driven from Maryland soil and across the Potomac with great ignominy and loss, and without having achieved a single object of any importance. If ever an army entertained great expectations, or was stirred with glowing hopes, it was the rebel army when it entered Maryland. And if ever glittering prospects were utterly crushed, it was when that army turned its back upon Washington, upon Baltimore; upon Philadelphia, and turned its face toward the dismal deserts of Eastern Virginia. It owned itself disappointed, overmastered, repulsed and discomfited. It acknowledged that the Union army was too strong, its courage too great, and its leaders too skillful, to successfully cope with. It will not be likely to try the same thing over again, as if has already failed under the most favorable auspices and circumstances.

The Police authorities allege that the prisoner is, and has been for the last six years, one of the most shrewd and successful domestic thieves who have ever attempted to ply their trade in this City; and, although only about 21 years of age, she is already far advanced in crime, if all the accounts given by the authorities be true. Her general plan has been to obtain situations as nurse, chambermaid, &c., by means of advertising. She always had a large number of certificates of character from the first families in the City, and in this way she could generally secure situations whenever she desired them. Her plan was to stay in a place long enough to learn where the jewelry, plate, &c., were kept, and then, after taking all she could conveniently carry away, she would be found missing some morning when the family came down to breakfast. The Police have been upon her track for the last eighteen months, but not until yesterday were they able to effect her arrest. When she was taken into custody she had just robbed the wife of Lieut.-Col. DAVIS, in Bleecker-street, of $700 worth of jewelry. Col. DAVIS is at present with the Union army, and his lady was under the necessity of appearing at the Police Station yesterday for the purpose of making a complaint against the offender. ELLEN is a woman of good address and quite intelligent; she has consequently been admitted into some of our first families as a companion and an equal. All parties who have suffered through her operations are requested to call at Police Headquarters to-day, and take a look at the prisoner.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d04b1e51-074a-545d-81c4-fa8f9a776a1c,550,nyt://article/d04b1e51-074a-545d-81c4-fa8f9a776a1c,

How many realize the fact that in less than ninety days from this time sixty or seventy thousand of our friends and brethren may be stricken down in battle -- thousands to find soldiers' graves, and more, by their wounds and sufferings, to become the objects of an anxiety and solicitude which shall sadden thousands of households. When our relatives are about to go forth to the fight, we are clamorous in our demands that they shall be armed and equipped with all the appliances of sturdy soldiers. Government gathers its stores of food, clothing and ammunition, and distributes them by the usual avenue.

Kelley and Staff were passing through a village up in the mountains, in pursuit of the rebels, when they stopped at a house to get something to eat. As the party was quite large, and as the General was in something of a hurry, his negro servant, Wilson, together with the servant of Capt. Geo. W. Harrison, called Granville, were sent into the kitchen to help the women of the house prepare the meal. It was not long before an abundant repast was placed upon the table and all of the officers, including the General himself, helped themselves heartily. After the meal was thus discussed the General walked out to the front part of the house and observing Wilson and Granvillle, told them to go back in the kitchen and get something to eat. The boys hesitated and made no reply, when the General assured them that if they were hungry there was no objection to their eating as much as they wanted. The boys then thanked him and said they had something in the wagon. An hour or so after the party got under way the General observed the two negro boys knawing ravenously at some hard crackers and flitch in the wagon. ""Wilson,"" said the General, in a somewhat angry tone, ""why didn't you and Granville get your dinners back at B.?"" Well, to tell do God's trufe, General, it was too -- dirty.""

Editorial urges women make warm clothes for soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/12/archives/patriotic-work-for-women.html,Editorial urges women make warm clothes for soldiers,"-- The women of the United States have done nobly since the war opened, in working for the soldiers. They began by making havelocks, scraping lint, putting up delicacies and comforts for the sick and the well: they have volunteered for nurses, and for hospital service, and in every way conceivable they have served those who were suffering for their country. This work is still actively kept up all over the land; and to each appeal of the army medical authorities, or the Sanitary Commission for aid of any kind, a prompt response has always been made. Cold weather is now coming on in Virginia as well as here; and the Sanitary Commission makes a request that the energies of the patriotic ladies of the land be now turned to the knitting of socks and the making of underclothes for the soldiers. Of lint there is enormous quantities on hand, and havelocks have long been discarded. Warm socks, warm undershirts, and warm drawers, are the things that are now wanted. Let every fine lady, young and old, let every mother who has a son, every sister who has a brother, every maiden who has, or expects to have a beau in the army, let every woman in the country and in the city, who has days or hours or minutes to spare, and who loves her country, devote their spare time to this patriotic work. Our army is now somewhere between a half a million and a million strong; and every soldier in it should have at least two pairs of warm woolen socks. This, as will be seen, will require close on two million pairs --which is sufficient to keep active all the knitting needles in the country for a long time. Every man should have a couple of woolen undershirts, and a couple of pairs of drawers. A million of each of these articles are needed. Government will of course do what it can; but, if the soldiers have to depend entirely upon the Government, many of them will have to go without socks, or with poor cotton trash and hundreds of thousands of them will shiver all winter without underclothes. Ladies, women all knit and sew -- and great will be your reward.

"We receive assurances from Washington that the rebel raid into Pennsylvania is not considered important there; that the disposition of the Na- tional forces will compel a hasty retreat of the enemy, and that their movements must be rapid to escape capture.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/12/archives/news-of-the-day-the-rebellion.html,,"We receive assurances from Washington that the rebel raid into Pennsylvania is not considered important there; that the disposition of the Na- tional forces will compel a hasty retreat of the enemy, and that their movements must be rapid to escape capture. Gen. MCCLELLAN telegraphed to the War Department yesterday that not one of the rebels in Pennsylvania should return into Virginia. It is to be hoped that this promise will be fulfilled. Meantime we give elsewhere such facts relating to the movements of the rebel force as have reached us by telegraph. Yesterday morning they destroyed a large amount of property at Chambersburgh, including the machine shops railway and rolling stock of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company at that place, and burned the railroad bridge at Scotland, five miles to the eastward. They also seized about five hundred horses, and a large amount of Government clothing -- exchanging the latter at once for their own dilapidated garments. At about 10 o'clock in the morning a portion of the force moved in the direction of Gettysburgh, with the intention, no doubt, of destroying a bridge at that place to prevent the approach of troops. The rebels, it now appears, crossed the Potomac near Clear Spring, early on Friday morning, and entered Pennsylvania by Blair's Valley. How they propose to get back again does not clearly appear, and Gen. MCCLELLAN's promise that they shall not escape is likely to be made good.

Full accounts of the National victories in Maryland had been received in England, and the journals, in commenting upon them, paid high compliments to Gen. McCLELLAN for his vigor and energy in defeating the rebels. The Times, however, insists that the cause of the North is not advanced one step by its ""unexpected victory."" The Paris correspondent of that paper states that a report is current in political circles that the British Government is no longer so entirely averse to the recognition of the Southern Confederacy, as it has heretofore been, and that there is a probability of the question soon becoming the subject of deliberation in Ministerial councils. Eminent men, of almost every European nation, assembled at the Social Science Convention at Brussels, are said to have signed an address to President LINCOLN in favor of a truce preliminary to negotiations for peace. The U.S. steam frigate St. Louis had left Lisbon, supposed in search of the rebel steamer Alabama, or ""290,"" before reported to be destroying American whaling vessels off the Azores. The reports of her depredations are fully confirmed by an arrival in England. It was fully expected in Paris that by the 1st of November the French army would be in possession of the City of Mexico. The latest accounts of GARIBALDI's health are said to be satisfactory. Rumors were again current of an amnesty in his case.

On Saturday morning they destroyed a large amount of property at Chambersburgh, including the machine shops, railway and rolling stock of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company at that place, and burned the railroad bridge at Scotland, five miles to the eastward. They also seized about five hundred horses, and a large amount of Government clothing -- exchanging the latter at once for their own dilapidated garments. At about 10 o'clock in the morning a portion of the force moved in the direction of Gettysburgh, with the intention, as was thought, of destroying a bridge at that place to prevent the approach of troops. They did not go to Gettysburgh, however, but when within three miles of that place turned to recross the South Mountain, striking the Cumberland Valley at Waynesboro, and proceeding toward the Potomac at Edwards' Ferry. They stopped at Monrovia, on the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, tearing up a small portion of the road to prevent the passage of troops. They then proceeded to Urbanna, through which place they passed, encumbered with, about a thousand horses, which they had captured during their progress, together with unknown quantities of boots, shoes and other necessary articles. They were soon followed through Urbanna by a large force of our cavalry, and afterwards heavy firing was heard on the line of rebel retreat, in the direction of Point of Rocks, indicating some opposition to the progress of the mauraders. Our latest dispatches, however, lead to the belief that almost the entire force escaped across the Potomac with their booty.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a4d46a4-a1c8-547e-a9c0-1beab835dfc2,1097,nyt://article/4a4d46a4-a1c8-547e-a9c0-1beab835dfc2,

The character is one in which he has always been severely criticised; yet there is no character he plays that he has tried more conscientiously to elevate from melo-dramatic energy to something like intellectual refinement. He has always taken a more philosophic view of the part than usual with tragic actors, making Richard politic and unscrupulous, rather than boisterous and cruel. He does not make Richard kill King Henry, and the infant princes out of sheer sanguinary malice, as very often apparently done; but he puts those victims out of the way because they are obstacles in his path to power. In short, he kills them from a self-imposed necessity, and not out of diabolical pastime. In his love making to the Lady Anne he also present a greatly improved version of that tender passage in the tyrant's turbulent career. It might be supposed that he really had such a passion for the lady as any man of ardent impulses could feel toward a woman whom he desired to marry; whereas the impression generally conveyed by other actors is that of an ogre, seeking to fascinate the unfortunate young woman for the sake of ultimately smothering or otherwise feloniously disposing of her. Mr. FORREST falls into the common mistake of too visibly betraying his agitation to his subordinates in the tent scene, but perhaps the situation would be less effective if it were rendered with more quiet naturalness. The last act Mr. FORREST plays with wonderful vigor, and with less tendency toward rant than even the language which he has to use would seem to warrant.

"-- By our latest advices from England, we learn that the London Press had got the details of the news of the rebel defeat and retreat from Maryland. They discuss the movements, as will be seen by the telegraphic abstracts given this morning, with varied intelligence and spirit. The fact of a substantial Union victory seems to be admitted on nearly all hands. The Times, of course, does not directly admit it, though it incidentally allows us a victory; but, as it cannot possibly claim a Confederate triumph at Antietam, it states the battle and its result in this oddly indefinite way: ""The Confederate army measured its strength with the army under Gen. MCCLELLAN, and the former did not succeed in beating the latter."" A great point, however, is made in our favor by the same journal when it admits that the contending armies have now, by this battle, been brought to an equality. We have been so long spoken of as hopelessly inferior to the rebels, and their continual and inevitable success in every engagement and movement has been so much harped upon, that it is comfortable to learn that it is now admitted that Antietam has brought us up at least to an equality with them. We have no doubt that, when Gen.

The case in point is the arrest of MOSES B. CHAPMAN, mock-auctioneer, and ZENO BURHAM, his agent. The former held the license, but the latter was known as the responsible party in carrying on mock-auction furniture sales, principally at No. 48 West Sixteenth street. Their mode of selling gaudy and glazed furniture belonging to ""a family about to depart for Europe,"" is too well known to need description. BURHAM had long defied law, and had more than once blustered defiance to the officers of the law, in the Mayor's office. His last complaining victim was THOMAS D. GREEN, who was not so verdant as his name, as he set his his case before the Mayor, and showed so positively that BURHAM & CHAPMAN had cheated him of $360, that BURHAM was forthwith arrested, and gave bail for trial in the sum of $1,000. CHAPMAN could not be found, but his license was revoked, and his bond sent to the Corporation Attorney for prosecution and forfeiture of $1,000. Yesterday he was arrested and bailed. From the success that has so far attended the efforts to suppress the mock-auctions, it is quite probable that the case will slip through the courts on technicalities of some sort.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8d2efbaa-be83-53b8-90de-a7cef096629f,1219,nyt://article/8d2efbaa-be83-53b8-90de-a7cef096629f,

Starvation has not only looked into the windows of its poor, but has actually entered their doors; and to a community thus distressed and desperate, it seemed safe to go with the arguments with which the agents of secession are always ready to stimulate popular dissatisfaction with the American war, and urge the British Government to intervention.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOYALTY OF THE BRITISH WORKINGMEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOYALTY OF THE BRITISH WORKINGMEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b476389-dbfb-58e8-bdef-570f666ff104,467,nyt://article/9b476389-dbfb-58e8-bdef-570f666ff104,

"We see that it is said that the Court-martial sitting to investigate charges preferred against Gen. MARTINDALE by Gen. PORTER will probably result in favor of Gen. MARTINDALE.

McDOWELL, which showed clearly that he ought to prefer charges against that General or be tried by Court-martial himself; and Gen.

There was time enough for such an inquiry during all the long months spent in the trenches on the Chickahominy. There has, surely, been time enough, since the rebel army left our forces in safety on the banks of the Potomac, to have held investigations into the charges made by POPE and MILROY.

Editorial on J Van Buren remark on capturing Richmond and then letting Confederates go,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/17/archives/let-them-go.html,Editorial on J Van Buren remark on capturing Richmond and then letting Confederates go,"Take Richmond, and then, if they insist, let them go, argues Prince JOHN, next to Mr. SEYMOUR, the principal speaker at the Ratification Meeting. And yet these same leaders affect indignation when then loyalty is questioned. They seem to take it for granted that the people have neither the wit to discern, nor the spirit to resent. In ordinary times, such presumption would be incredible. But when rebels are so monstrously infatuated, it is not strange that rebel sympathizers should also display uncommon folly. Nobody can be deceived in the meaning of this speech. If we are to let the rebels go, after taking Richmond, why not before? What care we for Richmond, but as a vantage ground against the rebellion? Why spend blood and treasure in gaining the rebel Capital, if, when gained, we are to give the Confederacy option whether to keep its power or not? No man in his senses can believe that our encampment on Shockoe Hill would make the rebel leaders love us better than before. It would only humiliate and embitter. If option is to be the word, it had better be spoken on the Potomac. In either case it is certain that the rebel managers would not for an instant entertain the idea of returning to the Union. They know full well that such return would be their political annihilation. Every calculation and every instinct would impel them to stick to the Confederacy. Rebel option means national disunion -- nothing more or less. Mr. VAN BUREN's exhortation to ""let them go if,"" is simply an exhortation to let them go anyhow. The locality where the alternative is presented is nothing. Whether at Washington, or Richmond, or Charleston, or New-Orleans, the offer would amount to a recognition of Confederate independence. It would give the rebels all they ask for. We say then that it is absurd for these men to protest adhesion to the war. Follow their counsel, and there is nothing left to fight for. It is just as absurd for them to claim loyalty. This language rivets and clinches every charge of disloyalty.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Let Them Go.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Let Them Go.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c7c8ed1-50b5-5008-a9d6-e1e24af04e67,769,nyt://article/1c7c8ed1-50b5-5008-a9d6-e1e24af04e67,

GEO. A. LEAVITT & CO., Nos. 21 and 23 Mercer-street. The attendance was quite as large as in former years, though the South was not very largely represented among the buyers. Orders from the rebel States will probably be deferred until after the 1st of January next, when the Emancipation Proclamation of President LINCOLN will have gone into effect, and the rebels will have time to turn their attention from war to literature. If the opening day may be relied on as an indication of what is to be expected in the way of sales, a larger number of books will be disposed of than were last year. There is no reason why the sales should not foot up to a most astounding sum. True, books will probably command higher prices than hitherto, owing to the rise in paper, caused by Secretary CHASE's immense consumption of it in making Treasury notes. But the unimportant addition of forty or fifty per cent. to the price of books, or anything else, can scarcely be felt while the supply of money to the popular pocket is only limited by the supply of paper, the energy of engravers, and the power of the Treasury's presses. No indication of hard times can be found in the table which the liberal Messrs. LEAVITT & Co. provide for their customers at noon-time. For I must be known that book-buyers out as well as other men. Not as in the good old times, indeed, before [???] and exchange rose beyond the reach of the [???] and white imports were subject only to [???], is the table spread with chickens and champagne.

By 10 1/2 A.M., a goodly number of distinguished churchmen, both clerical and lay, had asembled at the hospital. The little steamer employed in plying between the institutions on the adjacent islands was in readiness, and about 11 o'clock, the company of guests, preceded by the Right Rev. Bishop POTTER, of this Diocese, and the Hon. SIMEON DRAPER, Chairman of the Commission of Public Charities and Corrections, embarked. The party numbered in all 100 persons, including a fair representation of the ladles of the Church. The upper decks of the miniature steamer were densely crowded, and shortly after the craft got under way, a very serious accident was narrowly escaped. Right Rev. Bishop POTTER had, with a few pertinent remarks, introduced Mr. DRAPER officially to the company, and the latter had just replied and was proceeding to point out and describe the various institutions on the beautiful islands past which the boat was gliding, when, with a crash, a portion of the deck, some four or five feet in width, and reaching from side to side of the vessel, sank beneath the feet of the group crowded together to hear the Commissioner. In the first moment of alarm, all thought that the entire deck was giving way, and universal consternation prevailed. Had the weak shell, upon which scores of ladies and gentlemen were struggling, really broken through, loss of life and limb must have ensued. As it was, fortunately only a depression of some inches resulted, and the dangerous region was carefully avoided for the rest of the trip. This would have been gay and pleasant, had not a cold, drizzling rain marred the occasion. The same drawback existed throughout the greater part of the day and impaired its gratifications.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Episcopal Convention They Visit Our Charitable Institutions.; CONFIRMATION SERVICES AT THE ALMSHOUSE REVIEW AT RANDALL'S ISLAND A COLLATION ADDRESSES, ETC.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/17/archives/brooklyn-news-fire-in-public-school-a-fearful-panic.html,,"A NUMBER OF CHILDREN INJURED. -- Yesterday afternoon, as the children in Public School No. 20, in South Fourth-street, E.D., were engaged in their studies, smoke was discovered issuing from the flues of the heating apparatus. An examination disclosed the alarming fact that the wood work was on fire, and in a few moments the greatest confusion prevailed. The children made a simultaneous and frantic attempt to escape from the apartment, numbers rushing to the windows for the purpose of jumping out, which one or two actually did. The teachers directed their efforts to getting the children out, and succeded in effecting the egress of nearly all of them uninjured. But in the desperate attempt to get out a number were trampled upon, crushed and more or less hurt. One boy named DAVIS, whose parents reside in South Fourth-street had his leg broken. A little girl named EMILY WASHBURNE, residing in South Eighth-street, sustained a compound fracture of the collar-bone. A boy, whose name our reporter could not ascertain, was suffocated with the smoke, and taken out of the building in an insensible condition. His recovery is considered doubtful. The above, it is believed, are all the casualties of a serious character that occurred. As soon as the alarm for the fire was given, it was responded to by the Fire Department in strong force. And when it became known that the school house was on fire, the greatest excitement, confusion and alarm prevailed. Mothers rushed to the rescue of their children, and hundreds of spectators were anxious to render aid. The firemen and the police rendered efficient and important aid, both in extinguishing the fire and rescuing the children. The origin of the fire is presumed to have been entirely accidental. The damage done to the building is estimated at $500. The building will not be fit for use for several weeks.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; FIRE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL A FEARFUL PANIC', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; FIRE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL A FEARFUL PANIC', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/60dc8b64-c7dd-57a0-93c8-9096e8f1b90c,963,nyt://article/60dc8b64-c7dd-57a0-93c8-9096e8f1b90c,

Editorial laments delays in completing Union iron-clad vessels,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/19/archives/our-ironclads.html,Editorial laments delays in completing Union iron-clad vessels,"-- We hear of great delays in the completion of our iron-clad vessels. Some which, according to the contract, were to be completed four or five months ago, will not, at present rates of progress, be finished for as many months hence. We were assured that fourteen or fifteen of them would be afloat by the 1st of this month; but our readers know how far the promise is from being yet realized. Of course, admirable excuses are made for this delay, and it is shown beyond dispute that it was quite impossible to do the work within the specified time. But we should have supposed that the contractors would have known all this before they undertook their jobs, and before the country had formed such hopes of a Fall naval campaign, which, it seems, is likely to be unrealized. We had hoped that our new-iron clad navy would give us all the rebel sea-coast cities worth taking before the setting in of Wintr, so that our civil and military Governors of those cities might spend the cool weather in pacifying the infuriated rebels. But if these hopes are to be even partially indulged, the Navy Department and its contractors will have to push night and day the work on each and all of the embryo iron-clads. We understand that a naval expedition, in which some of our new Monitors are to take part, is being gotten up now, and will soon be on its way. We hope it will be directed against a point on the enemy's coast of some value and importance, and that our other iron-clads will be finished and launched so quickly that the first blow may be followed up until the whole of the coast is in our possession. Then ships from every quarter of the globe, in approaching any part of our vastly extended sea-line, shall behold flaming against the sky, and floating from every fort and city, the glorious and blood-baptized emblem of the Republic.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR IRON-CLADS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR IRON-CLADS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32a65581-0862-5e18-947d-35e9f8129f5a,332,nyt://article/32a65581-0862-5e18-947d-35e9f8129f5a,

The Surgeon-General only intended to summon skilled surgeons. He had no thought of asking the presence of the quacks who disgrace the medical profession.

Many of them were men who would have disgraced the medical profession in the days when barbers monopolized the skill and science of the healing and surgical arts.

"Among the loyal general officers who fell in the late battle of Corinth, was Brig.-Gen. PLEASANT A. HACKLEMAN, of Indiana. Previous to the commencement of hostilities he was a lawyer and politician of much promise, and for nearly twenty years edited the Rushville Republican. In 1841 he was elected to the Indiana Legislature as a Whig, after which, for a number of years, he hold the office of Clerk of the Court in his county. In 1847 he was the Whig candidate for Congress, and in 1858 the Republican nominee, but in both elections was defeated. In the Chicago Convention he voted for Mr. LINCOLN, although his preferences were for CASSIUS M. CLAY, for whose character he had a, great admiration. In 1860 he was appointed by the Governor of Indiana a delegate to the famous Border State Peace Convention at Washington. On the outbreak of the rebellion he accepted the position of Colonel of the Sixteenth Indiana, although of Quaker parentage, and a man of Peace by conviction.

"The most surprising statistical information contained in the invaluable, directory of H.G. LANGLEY, now on the eve of issuance from the press, relates to our population. Of the more than thirty-four thousand names, thirty-two thousand are white males over 21 years of age. This is an increase over the number of last year of four thousand, or nearly nineteen per cent. For the consolation of old bachelors and widowers, we will inform them that the number of females in this city over 18 years is seventeen thousand five hundred; and of damsels ""mostly"" under this ripe age, over twenty-five thousand. This exhibits an increase of twenty-three hundred of maidens and matrons over 18, or upwards of fifteen per cent. Of girls under 18, the increase is nearly twenty per cent. The annual increase of children to our permanent population exceeds 5,000. According to the census returns of the compiler of the Directory, the total population of the City of San Francisco is set down at 91,825. These figures are founded on the most reliable data, and as the greatest industry and care has been taken to enumerate all the people living in our midst, we believe the returns are as accurate as could be obtained in any other way. The number of white males over 21 -- names in the Directory -- 32,000. The number of females over 18, 17,500. The number of males under 21, and females under 18, 25,000. Males, foreigners, and names refused, 4,200. Chinese, male and female, 3,250. Cofored, 1875. Besides these, there is our great ""floating"" population, larger, probably, than in any other city of this size in the Union. The number of transcient boarders, soldiers, fresh-water sailors, and others doing business on our Bay waters, besides some who live, like ""Bummer and Lazarus,"" on the town, must amount to at least 8,000, which added to the above figures, gives the [???] of our population at 91,825.

There would be a gathering up of skirts and a careful picking of way; conversation would be less lively, and the general air of pedestrians more subdued. As it is, the dead of the battle-field come up to us very rarely, even in dreams. We see the list in the morning paper at breakfast, but dismiss its recollection with the coffee. There is a confused mass of names, but they are all strangers; we forget the horrible significance that dwells amid the jumble of type. The roll we read is being called over in Eternity, and pale, trembling lips are answering to it. Shadowy fingers point from the page to a field where even imagination is loth to follow. Each of these little names that the printer struck off so lightly last night, whistling over his work, and that we speak with a clip of the tongue, represents a bleeding, mangled corpse. It is a thunderbolt that will crash into some brain -- a dull, dead, remorseless weight that will full upon some heart, straining it to breaking.

"--Mystery is the great staple of novel writers, especially of those of the female persuasion. These latter transfer the veil from their own faces to shroud the characters they invent.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/20/archives/new-publications.html,,"-- Mystery is the great staple of novel writers, especially of those of the female persuasion. These latter transfer the veil from their own faces to shroud the characters they invent. At every turn and corner of their stories they mystify the reader by all manner of weak devices, pointing in a different direction from that they actually intend to take, flitting before you with simulated lameness, like the lapwing, to lead you away from the nest where their young brood of callow secrets lie. Of this art, Mrs. HENRY WOOD is the high handmaiden. She moves in a more mysterious way her wonders to perform than our own FERNANDO does. Her characters go through her stories as ships in crowded seas glide around in a fog, ringing bells to keep out of each other's way and carefully avoiding a meeting. Her last work, very properly christined The Mystery, is published by PETERSON & BRO., of Philadelphia, from advance sheets, for which a fabulous price is said to have been paid. The story is an ingenious one, and well managed in the main. A murder is committed, without any adequate motive on the part of the murderer, and the blood is sprinkled around in such a mysterious manner, that it is difficult to fasten it to the skirts of any one. A little girl, in a very innocent manner, manages to be everywhere where she should not be, and to hear everything that was least intended for her to hear. Were she not more retentive of talk than most young ladies are, she might set a great deal of doubt and trouble at rest in the early part of the story; but she preserves a most remarkable reticence, and permits the characters to go knocking their heads against each other, as awkward people do in dancing the Lancers. She is a very remarkable little girl, indeed, and eventually a most exceptional young lady. Truth compels the admission that Mrs. WOOD weaves quite an exciting and interesting chain of narrative from what seems at first glance to be rather slender material, though most readers will guess what is behind the mask long before the authoress removes it.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76a6b079-4ff4-576e-991a-c2e65444774c,1491,nyt://article/76a6b079-4ff4-576e-991a-c2e65444774c,

In the inception of the rebellion, Northern weakness was counted upon as an element of Southern strength. It was very lightly argued that a divided North could not stand against a united South. Nor could it. But hitherto there has been no division among our people. They have been a unit in their opposition to rebellion -- twenty million hearts have beat as one. The only chance for division has now occurred. The installation of a Republican Administration, a professed distrust of its supposed policy -- these were the pretexts the South offered in justification of its revolt. Were New-York to proclaim by its November vote that it too differed from the Administration and elected to oppose its necessary measures, it would be regarded by the revolted States as the first outcropping of Northern sympathy, the first indication of that disunitedness upon which they relied more than upon their armies when the skeleton of secession was first chalked out upon the cabinet walls of a Pro-Slavery President. It would be regarded by them as a virtual acknowledgment of the right of their rebellion -- for they only differed from the Administration in a slightly greater degree, and proclaimed that difference with more boldness, than New-York would in making such an election.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Domestic Dissensions More to be Dreaded than Foreign Intervention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Domestic Dissensions More to be Dreaded than Foreign Intervention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ba43329-0854-5787-97df-d8e15973fe12,1077,nyt://article/7ba43329-0854-5787-97df-d8e15973fe12,

Mr. WALLACK has pinned his faith entirely on the old comedies, whilst at Niblo's and the Winter Garden there has been no variety but that afforded by a judicious nightly change from one legitimate tragedy to another. This is a very excellent and inexpensive species of success so far as the managers are concerned, especially when the public seems to be content as well as generously patronizing. Yet the interests of dramatic art demand the occasional production of original pieces, either native or imported -- the former in preference, of course, if they can by any possibility be obtained. Standard pieces are all very well in their way, but the drama, like all living institutions requires now and then an infusion of new blood to sustain its vitality and preserve it from stagnation. Mr. WALLACK, recognizing this fact, and, as usual, becoming the exemplar of an enlightened change of policy, this evening brings out a comedy never before acted in this country. Called ""Friends and Foes"" when first presented in London, it has here been rechristened ""Bosom Friends,"" the alteration of name being justified by the remodeling which the piece has undergone at the lands of Mr. [???] WALLACK.

"rioting reported at Hyde Park, Eng, pro-Garibaldi meeting",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/22/archives/garibaldian-riots-in-hyde-park.html,"rioting reported at Hyde Park, Eng, pro-Garibaldi meeting","Hyde-park yesterday was the scene of a riot far exceeding in magnitude and in its serious consequences that which took place on the previous Sunday. In consequence of the interruption there was to the meeting of sympathy with GARIBALDI by a body of Irish roughs, and who succeded in thwarting the object of its conveners, large bodies of working-men had given notice to the committee that they intended being present in the park yesterday and supporting them at all [???]. The committee, not feeling justified in incurring the responsibility of calling a second meeting for yesterday, when a collision was likely to ensue, determined to abandon their intention to hold the meeting, and during last, week issued a notice to that effect. The publicity given through the Press to last Sunday's proceedings, however, combined with the fact that the abandonment of the meeting had not become generally known, caused an immense assemblage in the park yesterday. Before 2 o'clock all the principal thoroughfares lending to Hyde Park were crowded with persons proceeding toward it, many of them carrying thick sticks, and by 3 o'clock the police on duty estimated that at least 100,000 persons had passed through the park gates. As on the previous Sunday, the mound of earth near the marble arch was the centre of attraction, and at an early hour of the afternoon it was taken possession of by a body of about three hundred Irish laborers, armed with bludgeons, who at once raised the cry of ""Three cheers for the Pope, and down with GARIBALDI."" immediately surrounding this mound were stationed about 500 more of the same class similarly armed, and who openly expressed their intention to oppose by force any meeting being held in favor of GARIBALDI. It soon became rumored through the crowd that the Committee did not intend holding any meeting, and while many approved of this decision, by far the the greater number expressed much disappointment. On its becoming known to the Irish party on and about the mound, they set up a loud shout, and began taunting the Garibaldian party for their cowardice. A working man who, unperceived by the Irish, had made his way on to the mound, here rushed to the front, and, waving his hat, and holding aloft a board with the name of GARIBALDI painted upon it, called upon the vast mass of people in front and around the mound to give three cheers for the Italian patriot, which appeal was responded to by a tremendous burst of cheering from the assembled thousands. In an instant a dozen of the Irish bludgeons rattled about the head of the Garibaldian champion, and he was hurled from the mound bleeding profusely. This was the first act of violence committed, and was followed by a desperate rush of the Garibaldians upon the Irishmen, who, from the advantageous position they held, their determination, and the free use of their gudgets, succeeded in beating back their assailants, but few of whom had anything but Nature's weapons at their command. Just at this time a body of powerful Irish laborers and others came upon the ground, all armed with sticks, and ought their way up to their country [???], who, thus reinforced, and emboldened by their recent triumph, with loud hurrahs for the Pope, made a desperate [???] the crowd, knocking down indiscrimination, men, women, and children, amongst others two or three soldiers of the [???] who seemed in especial object of dislike to the Irishmen. The Garibaldians, irritated at this [???] and ruffianly attack, and headed by about twenty soldier, who had [???] to the aid of their [???] fought their way up to the [???] did after a severe straggle with the Irishmen ranged [???] succeeded in obtaining a [???] upon [???] now became one of great excitement. The soldiers, who were armed with sticks supplied [???] the crowd, amid the cheering of the Garibaldians and the yells and shouting of the Irish, laid about them with unsparing vigor. The blows from the sticks [???] blood began to flow [???] from the leads of both parties. Each soldier had at least a dozen assailants to contend with [???] of whom were evidently expert at the use of their weapons, and possessed of sufficient bulldog ferocity to make them most formidable opponents. At least a dozen men were lying at this time bleeding and senseless on the top of the mound, and the soldiers were on the point of being overpowered by numbers, when about half a dozen of the Life Guards, about the same number of the Third Buffs, followed by a body of at least fifty working men with sticks and umbrellas, rushed on to the mound and turned the tide of victory. After a terrific melee of about five minutes the Irish gave way, and made a precipitate retreat from their position. One soldier of the Third Buffs, a short thickset man, armed with a piece of park rail, knocked down six of the Irishmen in succession, receiving in return a severe wound in the forehead. As the Irishmen were beaten from the mound, the people below seized upon those who had made themselves must conspicuous, and dragged them to the outskirts of the crowd, and gave them in charge to the policemen, several of whom were there stationed, but with orders not to interfere unless under the personal orders of the Commissioner. Those who were identified as having taken an active part in the first onslaught upon the people were at once taken off to the Station-house. The Garibaldians and the solders being now in possession of the mound, one of the soldiers was hoisted on the shoulders of his comrades, and said if any of the Committee were present who called the meeting last Sunday, and wished to propose a resolution in favor of GARIBALDI, the soldiers would form a circle around the mound, and guarantee them a hearing. No one, however, responded to this appeal, but it gave rise to one of the greatest bursts of cheers that ever resounded in Hyde Park, followed by more cheers for the army. The Irish, now driven from the mound, and rendered perfectly infuriate by their defeat in that quarter, formed themselves into several detached bodies of about 200 each, and forcing their way into the crowd in different directions, began striking at all within their reach. It was estimated that there was at this time 200,000 people assembled, and the wishes of one portion of the crowd to escape the blows of these ruffians, the determined stand made against them by other portions, the shouts of the men, the shrieks of the women, and the cries of the juveniles, presented a scene of the most alarming description. Sticks were being used, and stones were flying in all directions, and at least 2,000 people were battling in different parts of the park. In some cases knives were used, and several persons were taken off the ground who had been stabbed. About 500 soldiers were now mixed up in the crowd, great numbers of whom were fighting against the Irishmen, who at last were overpowed, and fled in all directions, many of them meeting with knots of Garibaldians, by whom they were severely maltreated. Sir R. MAYNE and Capt. HARRIS, the Commissioners of Police, now came upon the ground, and it getting dusk, and seeing the alarming state of affairs, dispatched a constable to the Wellington Barracks for a strong picket of the Fusileers, about fifty of whom, under the command of an officer, but without arms, speedily attended, one party taking cossession of the mound, and the other ordering the soldiers into barracks.

In matters social and economical this method of dealing with difficulties may not, perhaps, be absolutely ruinous, since man's incapacity may well prove, after all, to be Heaven's opportunity.

The abstract love of truth, the artistic passion which grows with practice, mere personal ambition, and the thirst for wealth -- all conspire to make acquiescence hopeless at any stage of scientific achievement. We may be certain, therefore, that, nothing being yet absolutely settled by the long duel between artillery and armor, everything put at issue in that duel must be regarded as absolutely unsettled, and we must be careful not to suffer ourselves to be lulled into the delusion that the astonishing results of our recent experience with the Monitor, the Merrimac, and the Arkansas, have done anything more than communicate a new impulse to the ancient conflict.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Artillery and Armor.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Artillery and Armor.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/282d9e54-dadc-5135-b162-cd08bb7c6ec9,871,nyt://article/282d9e54-dadc-5135-b162-cd08bb7c6ec9,

SCOTT'S letter to Mr. SEWARD has called forth from the illustrious old soldier a vindication of his position on the secession movement in its early days. The document will be found in full in the TIMES of this morning, and will undoubtedly attract universal attention. Gen. SCOTT shows clearly, by documentary proof, the extraordinary and untiring efforts he made as early as October, 1860, to put the nation and the Southern forts in such a position of military strength that the rebellion would be crushed out as soon as it reared its head. He He rose from a sick bed in December when South Carolina was about to secede, and went to Washington, where he personally urged his views upon FLOYD, ("" who,"" says Gen. SCOTT, ""did not concur in any of my views."") He begged FLOYD to procure him an early interview with the President, that he might make one more effort to save the forts and the Union; and with Mr. BUCHANAN he also unavailingly discussed the same topics. For months Gen. SCOTT continued persistently and earnestly to reason in person with the authorities, and to send them correspondence and memoranda, urging the placing of the forts and arsenals in such a condition that the rebels could not hope for success; for as the Richmond Examiner (quoted by Gen. SCOTT) said: ""The Southern States are full of arsenals and forts, commanding their rivers and strategic points; and had SCOTT been able to have got these forts in the condition he desired them to be, the Southern Confederacy would not now exist."" But Gen. SCOTT's long and earnest labors were all ineffective -- the treason of FLOYD and the mingled treachery, imbecility and vacillation of the old knave BUCHANAN defeating nearly every one of his great and far-reaching plans. We will not attempt to give an epitome of the document, for we doubt not it will be read by every one, as it will assuredly take its place in history as a paper of the first importance.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN.

An invoice of Bibles, offered by Mr. HARDING, of Philadelphia, on Monday, netted that gentleman $500 more than a similar invoice did at the previous sale. The demand for religious books is very marked, indeed, and indicates that serious preparations are being universally made for death. There also seems to be a great demand for miscellaneous books, novels and stories that move the mind to mirth. In this we recognize tne different dispositions and habits that go to make up a novel. There are people who become pious under the pressure of circumstances, to whom trouble brings thought, who, when the star of death rises grimly and terribly above the horizon, betake themselves to prayer-books. And again there are those who attempt to shake off care by shaking their sides, who seek a refuge from thought and dismiss death as though he were simply a dun. Thus it is that theatres, con- cert saloons, and gin shops, are doing a better busi- ness just now than they did in times of peace, when death seemed distant from every one as the stars -- a possibility but not a probability -- a nebulous uncer- tainty rather than a fixed and surrounding fact.

It will be found that the Times regards the Proclamation as a futile assault upon the Confederacy, which will have no force except where the National arms penetrate to give it efficacy; while the Star considers it well calculated to make good men the world over pray for the success of the Union cause, besides being an effective war agency in arousing the blacks against the rebels.

"IRVING HALL.--It has been maintained by experienced managers and artists of long suffering that the days of popular concerts were at an end; that three-decker programmes, with fantasias all over them like buttons on a page's coat, were no longer attractive to the public.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/22/archives/amusements.html,,"IRVING HALL. -- It has been maintained by experienced managers and artists of long suffering that the days of popular concerts were at an end; that three-decker programmes, with fantasias all over them like buttons on a page's coat, were no longer attractive to the public. Mr. HARRISON, in his admirable series of entertainments, goes far to upset this theory. In reviving the palmiest days of miscellaneous music, he has also restored to the concert-room its ancient reputation of being the most harmless place where worldly delights can be enjoyed. Profuseness and excellence were combined with admirable discrimination in last evening's programme. Mr. GOTTSCHALK has seldom been heard to greater advantage, being received, of course, with the usual fervor. A fragment from a Fantasia on ""Somnambula,"" by the Cuban pianist ESPADERO, was the principal novelty, but it hardly justified the expectations excited by its announcement. The composer is said to be a remarkable man, and certainly owes a reputation to Mr. GOTTSCHALK, who never hesitates to speak with enthusiasm of his gifts. The fantasia is sufficient to excite interest, but not to call for further remark. In his own pieces, Mr. GOTTSCHALK was, as usual, Inimitable. Mr.THEODORE THOMAS played a couple of solos with superb elegance and clearness, especially a Tarantette, by VIEUXTEMPS. Mr. EDEN was excellent in his flute pieces, and Mad. Dr. LUSSAN sang with her accustomed tact and skill. Not the least interesting event of the evening was the debut of Mr. WM. CASTLE, a young American tenor, who possesses an admirable voice, and is evidently destined to assume a leading position in musical circles. In a romanza by MERCADANTE, and a pleasing ballad by Mr. A. WOOD, (""Things that Never Die,"") the best qualities of his voice were displayed; both pieces were encored -- ""La donna e Mobile"" being substituted for the first, and ""My Pretty Jane "" for the second. The latter was the least successful of Mr. CASTLE's efforts, being somewhat too florid and inconsequential for the earnest outpourings of a balladic swain. The gentleman's success, however, was none the less marked and merited. His voice is fresh, powerful, and of good quality, and his future clearly rests with himself.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e35f35a5-13bc-50c1-92b4-ceefc8406b86,427,nyt://article/e35f35a5-13bc-50c1-92b4-ceefc8406b86,

He delivered another speech last night in Brooklyn; and there was a large crowd present to listen to him. On this occasion, the Ex-Governor seems to have rather changed his tactics, and made an effort to plant himself on the platform occupied by the successful Democracy of the Western States. He avoided, in great measure, the semi-secession utterances which characterized his Cooper Institute speech. He has discovered that this great and loyal State will not sustain him in making war upon the Administration while it is engaged in fighting for its life and the life of the nation. But his real sentiments came out very legibly in some of his remarks, and more especially in the spirit in which they were uttered. It was quite evident that he is as much an enemy of the Administration, and as bitterly opposed to its policy of using ""all means to crush"" the rebellion as he was ten days ago. His buncombe phrases and hollow rhetoric will deceive no honest and determinedly-loyal voter.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""SEYMOUR'S BROOKLYN SPEECH LAST NIGHT."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""SEYMOUR'S BROOKLYN SPEECH LAST NIGHT."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-10-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8eee402-88f3-503d-8541-37139ac2f5d3,307,nyt://article/a8eee402-88f3-503d-8541-37139ac2f5d3,

His usual plan was to approach men passing through unfrequented streets, at a late hour of the night, suddenly draw a dagger, and threaten them with instant death unless they delivered to him all their money and valuables. Large amounts of money, and quite a number of watches have, in this manner, been obtained by him from his victims, who valued their money less than their lives. The last man who is known to have suffered from this footpad, is Mr. FERNANDO ESTRADO, a merchant, doing business at No. 483 Broadway. A few evenings since Mr. E. was met by this colored desperado, on the corner of Mott and Broome streets. With a terrifying threat, and a flourish of his steel, he demanded Mr. E.'s money and watch, and in default of which he said he would take his life. Mr. ESTRADO having no money with him, gave the robber his gold watch and chain, with which the latter at once made his escape. The victim applied at Police Headquarters, where he gave a description of the villain's person to Sergeant YOUNG, and by this means Detective FARLEY was yesterday enabled to effect his arrest. The prisoner, upon being taken to the Station-house, gave his name as ANTONIO ISMAGO BARTOL. Upon being confronted by Mr. ESTRADO, he was instantly identified as the man who robbed him. The accused says he was born in Cuba, has been 18 months in this country, but only about six weeks in this City. He says he is a waiter by occupation, and resides at No. 100 Hester-street. He was committed by Justice CONNOLLY for trial.

It would seem from a recent article in the Richmond Whig that the final decision of the rebel Congress was to leave the whole matter to the discretion of JEFF. DAVIS, and as it is left to him, the Whig calls upon him to do something about it. And the measure which the Whig would have him adopt is to issue a proclamation -- not a proclamation of counter emancipation, as some of our friends have seemed afraid would be done, not a proclamation that the whole thing was nugatory and might be utterly disregarded, as those few among us who hate emancipation have so loudly declared would be the view the rebels would take of it -- not a proclamation quieting the apprehensions of the inhabitants and assuring the soldiers that they need have no fear of insurrections. None of all these things meet the views of the Whig.

However earnest the desire of the National Government to preserve to the loyalists in those States the rights which they have never forfeited -- and among these the right to hold slaves -- it will be found impossible, in the nature of things, to do so, in regard to this particular class of property. Slavery and freedom cannot exist in such contiguity. Long since, it became apparent that no slave could be held in any county bordering on a Free State, provided the slave had spirit enough to aspire to be a freeman. Hence, Slavery has not practically existed for years in all that belt of country comprising the northern parts of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky. Now, surround those States with free territory, in which thereafter no Fugitive Slave law can be enforced, and what will be the result? With the moral excitation on the subject that the war has brought, added to the causes that have thinned the slaves heretofore from the Northern border, it is clear that the institution must die -- as quickly and surely as a man dies who is set a-bleeding at every pore.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Liberated Slaves.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Liberated Slaves.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f58889fb-23f1-51a4-a201-af50f5bc4bd5,843,nyt://article/f58889fb-23f1-51a4-a201-af50f5bc4bd5,

Our readers know that the city has been in a critical condition for some time, with a rebel force in its vicinity small, but sufficiently impudent to have sent in a flag of truce demanding its surrender. Our army of defence, however, is quite able to hold it, so far as fighting is concerned, unless the rebel force is greatly increased; but the enemy seem rather to be making an effort to starve it into terms. The city is cut off from all communication with the North, and is seriously straitened for supplies. If now BRAGG's army advance against it, it will be in an almost hopeless condition. BRAGG will undoubtedly do something soon, and this is the work nearest to his hand.

Mr. Whitehead closed the summing up for the prosecution, after which Recorded HOFFMAN charged the jury, reviewing the evidence in detail, or such parts thereof as bore directly upon the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused. He said that in this case there was a direct contradiction in the testimony of witnesses for the prosecution and for the defence, upon material points; and the principal question for the jury to decide was which of the witnesses was entitled to belief. Two witnesses for the defence testified positively that Matthews had a dirk-knife in his hard when he attacked the accused, while two witnesses for the prostitution swore that they saw no knife, and the policemen who was called to the scene of the homicide both swore that they found Matthews lying on the ground with no knife in his hands, and that when he was taken to the Station-house the dirk was found sheathed and attached to a belt under his vest. The question whether Matthews used a knife in his attack upon the accused was of great importance, as showing whether the accused was in such imminent danger of his life from the attack as to justify the use of his own knife against his adversary. The Recorder laid down with great clearness the law governing justifiable homicide, and said it was for them to decide whether the facts in this case came within the rule. The prisoner was entitled to the benefit of any doubt resting upon their minds, but such doubt must be a reasonable one, and sufficiently strong to create such a balance in their minds that they could conscientiously find a verdict either way.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; THE HOMICIDE OF PAT MATTHEWS.

This statement was particularly incumbent upon him, inasmuch as he stands charged with faint-heartedness, if not false-heartedness in relation to the war. This charge has gained color from the undisputed fact, that up to the very time the war began, Mr. SEYMOUR publicly denounced coercion in the strongest terms, and from the fact, which we believe is equally undeniable, that, since the war began, he has steadily held aloof from all practical furtherance of it, either by gift of money or encouragement of enlistments. His antecedents bear very much against him. If they give him a position that is not really his, there was urgent necessity that he should right himself by defining his real position fully and precisely. This just expectation of the public was not met.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Seymour's Speech in Brooklyn."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Seymour's Speech in Brooklyn."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3c441b6e-cb6d-5f94-9f80-7aff0a350987,1177,nyt://article/3c441b6e-cb6d-5f94-9f80-7aff0a350987,

The World clamors for Opera without seeming to know that other lands than italian have done something in the cause of art. There are hundreds of works in German and French that could be transplanted successfully to this latitude, were managers more enterprising and the public less wedded to what is fashionable. Mr. ANSCHUTZ in his venture at Wallack's theatre, has thrown himself upon the genuine appreciation of the public. With a company, which all things considered is amply sufficient for his purpose, a good orchestra and a well selected chorus, he has offered from week to week a choice of works popular in German theatres but unknown elsewhere. No better musician exists in this country, and this circumstance accounts for a degree of completeness in the representations which could hardly be predicated from the known material of the establishment. The critic, who is not cramped by prejudices, detects in every performance something which raises it above the average of ordinary performances, whilst the amateur listens with pleasure to the careful interpretation of works that are, perhaps, entirely new to him. ""Johann von Paris,"" which was produced at the German Opera house on Wednesday, is a work that no longer possesses the bloom of youth, but so agreeably was it performed, and so pleasantly were its charming melodies offered to the ear, that it obtained a success such as the composer in his palmiest days might have envied. The principal parts were intrusted to Mme. JOHANNSEN and Mme. ROTTER, both of whom were more than equal to the demands made on them. HERR GRAFF, a respectable basso, was excellent also as the Seneschal, and HERR KROUFELD, an admirable comedian, kept the house in constant merriment as the overwhelmed innkeeper. The minor parts were cared for in the best manner, and a terpsichorean scene in the third act by Mile. THELEUR and Mons WIETHOFF brought down the house by its excellence. We have seldom, indeed, listened to an opera that in its manner of performance and placement on the stage, gave more genuine satisfaction, or merited greater praise. BOILDIEU's music is full of graceful, case and melodic charm. It is written with the freedom of a master, and with none of that over wrought effort which now passes muster for effect. The third act, which, displays the master's best characteristics, was received with a tumult of applause, and insured a triumphant success to the performance. Both Mm. [???] and [???] were encored in the [???] The opera is so pleasant, and the performance so good, that we shall be greatly disappointed if it does not crowd the cosy quarters of the Germans for many evenings to come.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.; GERMAN OPERA.

The witness Beaufort was still examined, and testified -- I never saw Horn on the vessel but once, but was at this office a number of times; Tilton was Captain of the vessel from here; Crawford was mate; I was second mate; Schomberg had general management of fitting her out; he was aboard nearly every day; I went to see Horn once about coal and he asked me when Schomberg had been there; he told me to go and order coal, and I did; I saw Schomberg pay money to the men; 26 or 27 persons left New-York in the vessel; we went to St. Thomas; Tilton left the vessel there, and Crawford took command; Curvelo and Mandillo went in the vessel from New-York; they went ashore at St. Thomas; I was ashore there 12 or 15 times; the vessel was there 12 or 15 days; I saw Curvelo ashore there; I was supposed to be first mate after we left St. Thomas; Flores acted as second mate; we took out six Spaniards from New-York, besides a Spanish steward; at St. Thomas we discharged part of the cargo; kept on board bread, beans, rice, bacon, mackerel, 60 or 70 barrels of bread, 25 or 30 barrels of beans, 25 tierces of rice, 1,500 pounds of bacon, 75 or 100 boxes of herrings, one barrel of palm oil, which was afterwards mixed with the negroes' food; we took on board cargo at St. Thomas; there was no change of crew at St. Thomas; no new persons went from St. Thomas; Tilton and Curvelo stayed in St. Thomas; we went from St. Thomas to Barcelona, in Venezuela; on our way there shooks were put up into casks; we took a few cabin stores there, and some water; from Barcelona we went directly to the coast of Africa, and made land near Cape St. Paul, on Tuesday, Aug. 7, 1860; we hoisted a flag as we ran within two miles of the coast -- a private signal; then we ran down the coast a short distance, and a canoe came on board with a man in it; this was in the Bight of Benin; we took on board between 500 and 900 negroes at Whydah; took them as soon as we let go the anchor; remained there from about 8 A.M. till about 8 P.M.; no one went ashore; one passenger came aboard -- a Portuguese, I think; the vessel sailed that evening, and came back to Cuba; at Cuba the negroes were landed; after that we got the ship under way and took her out to sea; ran out into 16 or 17 fathoms of water; I told the men to lower the boats and get into them; we stopped the ship, we got into the boats and abandoned the ship; Crawford and Mandillo were aboard and went ashore in one of the boats; the vessel and part of the crew were taken by a Spanish man-of-war; the men were afterward liberated by the Spanish Government, and were sent to Key West; I came in a steamer from Havana to New-York; I called on Horn next day after my arrival; he asked me about the ship, how many negroes we had on board, and how the ship came to be taken; I told him all the particulars, and he said it was a sorry job; he paid me $25 then, and $200 in all; I arrived here about Oct. 15 or 16; a year or so after I came back I was sick in the country; I was in Horn's office a dozen times; went into the country in May; I was informed by note from Mr. Horn's clerk that there was a warrant out for me; I was not at home when the note came; I saw Horn after I came back from the country; I met him on Broadway; he said, ""What are you doing here? don't you know you will be arrested?"" I said I was going back in the country: he said I had better go, and stay there; I saw him again on my return from the country the second time; he told me he had been arrested, and that I had better clear out, and not stay in New-York; Horn told me, after I came back from Havana, that he had lost a great deal of money by the ship, somewhere about $9,000; he read me a letter from Mandillo; he stated that he had paid the crew who were not taken some small sum of money; Horn stated that Mandillo said he would send me some money through Horn -- $600; it was to be paid to Horn's brother, in Havana; Horn said Mandillo said that for the negroes taken to land he had received the money for; about April I went to Horn, and asked him if the money had been sent from Havana, and he said ""No""; I went again and he said it had not come, and he did not think I would get it, as the merchants were failing there; he offered to buy my claim, and paid me $200 for it; he asked me to leave the City three or four times; I talked with Capt. Tilton before we left here about fitting out the ship; we were talking about the coast of Africa; he said he thought she would carry so many negroes; I differed from him; we spoke of what she would make if she did carry as many negroes -- some $300,000 or $400,000. Nothing was said about Horn's buying the vessel, nor of her being transferred to Crawford; on the voyage out to St. Thomas, I heard of her being sold from Tilton; he did not say what kind of a sale it was to be; at St. Thomas I heard that Curvelo and Mandillo were to purchase her and take title in Crawford's name.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Slaver City of Norfolk Trial of Horn.; UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OCT. 25, 1862.

After dwelling upon the importance of personal faith in God on the part of the soldier, he dwelt upon the value of faith in our country, and in the good cause in which we are engaged, and said in this connection: ""There is too little faith in our country, especially here at home. The soldiers in the field believed sincerely that the enemies of our land are yet to be overthrown; this I am convinced of after eighteen months' experience among them. It is the duty of every man and woman to have faith in our country, and to have faith in no one who has not faith in the country, for such as have no faith are demagogues. God is always with those who are fighting for justice and liberty; and I believe we are more right in these respects than our enemies.

November,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/27/archives/the-magazines.html,November,"-- Harper's Magazine for November is as crisp and cheerful as one of the brilliant Fall days which we are now enjoying. During the sleepy Summer months it dragged heavily now and then, for Harpers, as well as Homers, must sometimes nod; but the Twenty-fifth Volume, of which this number is the finis, closes with a rush and flourish such as marks the advent of a stage-coach into one of the towns along its route, where the horses are changed and the passengers fed. J. ROSS BROWNE opens the number with one of his graphically written and illustrated papers. This time he discusses Poland Over-Ground. December will bring us the antithesis, Poland Under-Ground. Mr. BROWNE bears the same relation to the present generation of travelers that BAYARD TAYLOR did to that now passing off the stage. The latter described countries which few had seen, and was interesting in spite of himself; the former goes over and under ground which has been written of for the last quarter of a century, and surprises the most blasc tourist by showing him how much he has left unseen. ""A Notable Congress"" tells us much that very few people know regarding insects which are nearly omnipresent. Dr. GUERNSEY condenses Capt. GRONOW's interesting hook, ""The Last of the Dandies,"" in a manner which will not diminish the desire to read the work itself. To be sure, it is no compliment to the members of a tribe which throngs Broadway on a pleasant afternoon to intimate that they are but imitators, and that the last of a race which they are feebly trying to perpetuate has passed from earth, or is very soon to take his conge, but Capt. GRONOW demonstrates the fact completely. Mr. LOSSING's sketch of the 'First Colonial Congress"" embodies no new facts and might as well have been written by anybody else; and nearly the same might be said of W. PARKER SNOW's paper on ""Arctic Explorations;"" but these articles will both be read with interest by those who insist on having the historical department of the magazine sustained. Miss PRESSCOTT's story of ""Madeleine Schaeffer"" is concluded. ""Romola,"" ""Orley Farm,"" ""Mistress and Maid,"" and ""The Small House at Allington"" we regard with more liking, as they nearer approach their respective end. It is a manifest improvement, however, to allow them to usurp but one-third the entire number of pages in a single issue; sometimes, when nothing better was at hand, they have been assigned one half of the whole number. It needs the genius of a MORPHY, or some one who can play half a dozen games of chess blindfolded, to keep distinct the thread of four or five serials in a monthly magazine, nor should the mental capacity of readers be taxed so cruelly. Of the Editor's Drawer not much can be said. Some jokes, which are not jokes at all, find a place. Those who feel an interest in the Drawer should drop into it a few grains of wit. The two illustrations. ""The Regatta on the Steamer"" and ""The Regatta on the Yacht,"" seem a little like an after-thought, for the scenes which they represent transpired more than four months ago, and will not recur until next June, but the excellence of the sketches, which are the best that have appeared in Harper's for a long time, makes this anachronism pardonable. The poetry of this number is very good. ""Non Respondet,"" by CLARENCE STICKNEY, is a nervous and spirited production; and Mr. SHEPARD's poem. ""Autumn,"" contains some very line descriptive lines.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Magazines.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Magazines.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Magazines', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b912b99-cdf6-5b91-aa64-df3aa199e982,1530,nyt://article/2b912b99-cdf6-5b91-aa64-df3aa199e982,

"The entire success of the musical and dramatic season has encouraged Mr. GRAU to complete the organization of a good company for the Academy of Music, which will be opened on the 10th of November, under his management.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/27/archives/amusements.html,,"The entire success of the musical and dramatic season has encouraged Mr. GRAU to complete the organization of a good company for the Academy of Music, which will be opened on the 10th of November, under his management. The stockholders of the Fourteenth-street establishment, as well as the artists engaged there, have modified their terms to the standard of the times, and it is likely, therefore, that Mr. GRAU's season will extend through the whole Winter season. Something like an important effort at management is absolutely necessary to restore the Opera to its old position, as the leading fashionable amusement of the Metropolis. The brief and desultory seasons of last Winter, with their small excitements about smaller things, leave nothing to be remembered with pleasure. They were conducted with a strict view to economy, and under the conviction that a more important adventure would certainly fail. Just as surely would a repetition of the same sort of close management lead to disaster now. New-York has long since passed the rudimental state of opera, and, except under extraordinary circumstances, will be content with none but the perfect thing. Mr. GRAU is thoroughly alive to this fact, and his arrangements indicate an intention to restore, as far as possible, the palmiest days of operatic management. The season will be remarkable for the introduction of several new artists, and the production of MEYERBEER's latest opera, ""Le Pardon de Ploermel."" The impresario is singularly rich in prime donne, having a good half dozen of more or less reputation. Mme. GUERRABELLA, an American prima donna, who has achieved much success, will in all probability, open the season, followed by Mme. LORINI WHITING, another American, in dramatic roles, such as ""Norma."" Several of the best works of the Italian repertoire will be revived for these artists. About the second or third week of the season MEYERBEER's new work will be submitted to the public, the principal part -- Dinorah -- being sustained by Mll'e CORDIER. This is necessarily the great event of Mr. GRAU's season, and will attract the particular attention of the musical community. There is hardly a question about the success of the opera, unless it should be New-York's unenviable privilege to reverse the unanimous verdict of Europe. Wherever ""Le Pardon de Ploermel"" has been brought out, it has been received with the greatest enthusiasm by the public, and this notwithstanding the fact that the music is of a singularly reticent character. Like other works by the same master, it requires very ample resources, and we are glad to hear, therefore, that Mr. GRAU has no intention of economising with respect to the orchestra and chorus, both of which have heavy work to perform in the opera. In addition to the artists we have named, it is hinted that Miss KELLOGG, Miss CARLOTTA PATTI, and Madame STRAKOSCH will also belong to the company. There are no fresh names among the male artists, but it is only right to add that a better trio than BRIGNOLI, AMODIO, and SUSINI could not very easily be found. The company promises, indeed, to be one of the best we have had for many years, and the season one of the most interesting. If only a reasonable portion of the patronage which is showered on other places of amusement be extended to the Academy of Music, there can hardly be a doubt about the issue of Mr. GRAU's experiment. Signor MUZIO will be the conductor.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/329ca87e-0c27-5289-a3ae-395c283132b5,1123,nyt://article/329ca87e-0c27-5289-a3ae-395c283132b5,

Brave men, who wore on their breasts the medals of Delhi and Lucknow, -- men whose stout arms and true hearts had been England's bulwark in her extreme hour of peril, -- men who had thrown their lives between the Sepoy and his prey, rescuing English honor from the dust and English mothers from despair and death, -- these men were packed away on board of leaking vessels, supplied with poisonous and tainted food, crowded in unventilated holds, and landed at last on the shores of the country they had covered with glory, half naked and more than half dead, wan, wasted, fever-smitten, to perish of disease, or to live as memorials of England's neglect and wrecks of England's honor. The pen of DICKENS was consecrated to their wrongs and to the branding of those by whom such wrongs had come. We read his eloquent outburst of righteous wrath, and shuddered at his terrible photograph of patient misery and heroic endurance.

The argument is old enough, and pretty well worn, but is restated as if it were quite a refreshing novelty. The gist of it is that it is unwise to assail the rebels, as their army is stronger now than it will be at any future time; while if we wait till the Northern conscription is enforced, our army will be greatly stronger than it is at present. Their supplies of arms and clothing are giving out, while ours is increasing; and we shall soon have a fleet of iron-clads to attack Charleston and Mobile -- though the Star says nothing about the fleet of iron-clads the rebels are likely to have if we give them plenty of time. Besides all this, the position of LEE at Winchester is very strong; and if he should be beaten there, he would retire to certain mountain passes and fight a succession of battles which may cost us 50,000 men, while one thousand rebel cavalry can compel MCCLELLAN to employ 50,000 more soldiers to watch them.

He occupied Lovettsville at night, and was expected to move forward yesterday morning -- in what direction is not yet known.

The reports from the front announce that the rebels have drawn in their pickets at Charlestown, abandoned Martinsburgh, after completing the destruction of the railroad property, and fallen back toward Winchester.

Instead of hiding his shame in mock devotion to his country, he makes himself more at home in faction and sedition than ever.

In fact he never was on quite so fierce a rampage as just now. In his speech at his ratification meeting as nominee for Congress, he declares what he is going to do when he gets to Washington. ""I am going to the President, and I will tell him that without we have a change of measures, so help me God! we will make a change of men."" If Old ABE don't listen to his dictation, what then? Why he soon says, in a connection that cannot be mistaken: ""A despotism has come upon us; and if a despotism has come, if we are to have a tyrant, I want a splendid, brilliant ruler, one that has nerve and brain, and is equal to the emergency.""

BRADY, Esq., upon the issues of the day. Shortly after 8 o'clock, the President of the Association made his appearance on the platform, accompanied by the orator of the evening, who was greeted with loud cheers. He was at once introduced to the audience, and proceeded to say that instead of calling them fellow-citizens and fellow-Democrats, he perhaps ought to follow the example of a distinguished orator who, on a memorable occasion, in addressing the residents of this City, called them ""Fellow-traitors."" He was happy to have the honor of addressing them at that particular juncture in our history, and was glad to see the old and the young men assembled together to give free and fearless expression to the sentiments which the Democracy entertained, and sentiments which were not only entertained by them, but were silently and secretly cherished in many a bosom of conservative Republicans in the land. [Applause.] The young men who had banded themselves together in that Association, to disseminate their principles and sustain their doctrines, would not only cover their own names over with glory, but the names of all who love them with glory and prosperity. That was the first time for a long period that he had made a political address. It had been his misfortune during a year past to suffer from an affection of the throat, which had led him to be cautious in speaking before large bodies of men; but the very last public address that he made he could recur to with just pride in view of the aspersions cast upon the Democracy in reference to their loyalty to the flag and arms of our country. The very last speech that he made in public, and one that seriously aggravated the illness under which he was laboring, was when he had the honor of presenting a flag to a regiment of Massachusetts soldiers, on its way to the war. [Cheers.] He was glad to have the opportunity of addressing his fellow-citizens in New-York, as he was wont to do on the eve of an important election. He began to do so when there was no danger of any species of treason in the land, at a time when that party, which, after different mutations was at last presented in the form of a species of republicanism, to which he would allude again, was engaged in opposing that great man who stirred the profoundest depths of every young man's heart in the time when he began his life -- JACKSON, whose name is a tower of strength. But was he not mistaken in saying that there was going to be an election? He had always understood an election involved the idea in some way of a choice between two sets of principles and two sets of candidates, but he had seen instructed, from what he had seen in the papers emanating from some of the so-called distinguished orators of the fanatical and rabid portion of the Republican Party, that there was to be no election at all -- [laughter] -- that there was to be but one candidate -- and that, as the lawyers would say, the whole of this must go by default. He was informed by them that the only choice left for them was that which the man gave his wife on the occasion of a severe domestic feud, when he said to her, after a great deal of altercation: ""My darling, you can stay in this house or not, exactly as you please, but I am determined you shan't stay."" Mr. BRADY then alluded to the resolution proposed some time ago by GEORGE W. BLUNT, who informed the people of this intelligent City, that the man who voted for WADSWORTH gave a vote for patriotism, and the man who voted for SEYMOUR was equivalent to a traitor. He (Mr. BRADY) should be sorry to believe, like Mr. BLUNT, or any man who entertained the same narrow, illiberal, despicable and prescribing principles. He should be sorry to think that the State in which he was born after the close of the next canvass should present such a number of traitors, as he designates them, as will be found at the close of the next election. [Applause.] On the subject of being permitted to have a choice in the sanction of rulers, he would call a witness in his favor, and he believed there was not a Republican throughout the land that would quarrel with the nature of the testimony he was about to adduce. He had read, when he began to study the rudiments of political science, in the Declaration of Independence, that ""Government derived its just powers from the consent of the governed."" He found that doctrine stated a little more strongly by a gentleman who said, in a speech at Peoria, ill., on the 16th of October, 1854, when speaking of the political right of negroes to political equality with while men, these words: -- "" What I do say is, that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle and sheet-anchor of American republicanism."" He (the speaker) thought that was a little too strong, and thought that the doctrine there promulgated, in a republican form of government, that no man had a right to govern another in any sense without his consent, was a little unpleasant, because if that was so none of the Democracy consented to the election of Mr. LINCOLN, and in that sense none of them would owe him allegiance. He thought, therefore, in view of that testimony, that it was no particular offence on the part of an American citizen that he purposed in an election in the great State of New-York to give his vote to one or the other of the two opposing candidates, unless in the expression of his opinion, he should be found guilty of that thing they call treason. Treason! the flippant folly, the atrocious audacity of a set of men who had never stood by the wars of this country. [Applause.] Mr. BRADY alluded to the war of 1812, when the Democratic Party, with its usual proclivity to a fight, [laughter.] was battling for the rights of our young country against that lower which was now basely threatening to do its injury. He would like to know what was the position of a certain set of gentlemen in New-England -- a country of which he spoke with respect, because he admired its energy and its intellect, and was happy to number among his most intimate friends some of its sons. In one of the States of New-England, while that war was progressing, they refused the occupancy of their prisons by the Federal Government for the detention of enemies taken in war; and when the Federal Government undertook to enforce its power and authority, there broke out a certain Convention, in which the doctrine of secession, for the first time in the history of this country was clearly, distinctly and openly advocated in a preamble, address and resolutions written by one of the most distinguished men that ever gave lustre to the intelligence of any part of our country -- ROGER SHERMAN. And when he mentioned that name, it was not that he would lend the slightest sanction to any such doctrine as secession, in the modern acceptation of that term, but quite the reverse, as they would see in the subsequent portions of his remarks. He merely sought to vindicate the Democratic Party, at a period so far back as 1812, against the idea that it ever opposed any war for the greatness, the prosperity and the renown of this country, and so to vindicate it against the men opposed to the Democratic Party, who, even in that eventful struggle, sought to bring disgrace upon our arms and give triumph to our foes. How was it in regard to the war with Mexico, during the Administration of JAMES K. POLK? Was it not always charged by the opponents of the Democratic Party that that was a war of conquest, set on foot for the acquisition of territory, that the Slave Power might be extended, and that new States in which Slavery was permitted should be brought under, the protection of the Federal Constitution, and that the Slave Power should be increased at the expense of freedom? And when war was declared against the strong opposition of that party which had the impudence to charge the Democracy with a want of patriotism, in what paper was it that you read that the American flag was a flaunting he? [""The Tribune, followed by hisses for GRESLEY.""] From whose mouth did they hear the wish expressed that on the soil of Mexico -- their brothers and sons, who went there to sustain the honor of our country and got victory to our arms -- would meet at the hands of the Mexicans with hospitable graves? [""That horrible monster, GREELEY.""] He invited the Republican Press that either of them would make between now and election, to name the first time in the history of our century when the Democratic party, or any portion of it, in [???] in private, has even [???] practiced upon any principle indicating any desire, when a war broke out, except to sustain it, [???] at every expense, until there could [???] honorable peace and additional glory to our Government. [Cheers.] Mr. [???] of the [???] the London Times [???] to the war in Mexico, when [???] of the Yankees ever to [???] encounter, and said that [???] Vera Cruz, was [???] which, if [???] by [???] for the American [???] holding a high position [???] subsequently the Republican [???] office, a man of very inferior [???] who, [???] tiny, disobedience, and [???] was [???] from the service of the United States. He [???] JOHN C. FREMONT. [???] JOHN C. FREMONT, was the darling of a certain portion of the Republican party, and most unfortunately for our army, and for the [???] in which we are all engaged, he was given a high command, and they sought to cover him over with glory and renown, in view of this historical fact, with which they were all acquainted, at the same time that in the most dastardly and assassin-like manner, they sought to do injury to that gallant young man, whom he had never seen nor corresponded with, and who was a perfect stranger to him, but with reference to whom he was glad to avail himself to say, that the time would come, when all his enemies would be compelled to shout in his praise. He meant MCCLELLAN. [Loud cheers.] Mr. BRADY then paid an eloquent tribute to RICHARD O'GORMAN, who had delivered an address upon the crisis, and said he hoped he would be excused from saying that when he read in the columns of any journal an aspersion upon Mr. O'GORMAN's loyalty, it was another instance of that detestable audacity to which he had previously referred. He thought at a time when the whole country was wringing with the praises of those gallant sons of the Emerald Isle, who had gone forth to battle after battle, Democrats as they were all, [applause,] to fight for our success and for increased glory to the country in which their fortunes were cast; in view of the sublime developments thus made by men eager to shed the last drop of their blood, to apply to them, by any species of suggestion, by hint or inuendo, the insinuation that they could be guilty of treason to this country, ought to damn to eternal infamy the source from which such a charge came. They were, as he and as all the Democrats he knew of, in favor of prosecuting this war, but for what purpose and to what end? In favor of prosecuting it vigorously, with all the power that can be applied to it, that through the presence of an honorable peace the Union might be restored, perfected and continued, so that our general Government is preserved, to use the language of JEFFERSOM, ""in its entire constitutional vigor."" [Cheers.] To show the sincerity of the Democratic party, and to illustrate his position in regard to that, he would take the liberty to state that at no time did anything emanate from him that was not designed to secure to every portion of this country under the Constitution of the United States every claim of right to which it might make a just claim. And he would state to them in public what he had never before disclosed, except in the relations of private confidence, (and he blushed to do it because it was for the moment seeming to give him an importance which he did not feel,) that when he assumed the position of the candidate for Governor on the Breckinridge ticket with a perfect certainty that that ticket would be defeated, and against the remonstrances of some personal friends, and against the censure of old political associates, determined to adhere to that nomination and follow the fortunes of that little army, though it should be dwindled down to as few as were the signers of the Declaration of Independence, it was to say in public that he did not leave the State of New-York in such a condition that the South, when it claimed the right to secede, should say that it had no political organization to represent it in the State of New-York. He nurtured that thought close to his heart, for he knew it would have been egotistical to have avowed it at the time, and he knew also, what events were occurring in the South calculated to disturb the relations of this Union to its various members, and if that secret thus hugged here, said he, had eaten out my heart, as the stolen fox did which was hidden under the folds of the young Spartan's garment, I think I could have died without making an avowal of the purpose by which I was actuated. He was desirous that no Southern statesman, nor any of the Southern people might find in the election of ABRAHAM LINCOLN an excuse for the division of the Union, and he would be unjust to what he believed if he did not say that the act of the South in leaving those who stood so manfully by them in years of trial and minority was one without the slightest pretence of justification or excuse; and if there be in the South any man who loved the Union, now, when the time was approaching that the shock of the fiercest battle which had ever yet occurred, and which was soon to disturb the present tranquility of the land, and bring anguish to the hearts of new thousands afflicted by the loss of those they love -- if there be any Union men in the South, he called upon them to trample their leaders under their feet as dust in the balance, come forward, and reestablish this Union, lay down their arms, and give us a chance. [Cheers.] The vote for LINCOLN in the Presidential election stood as follows: In the Free Status, 1,810,430; vote for the Democratic and Union tickets 1,706,339, making the majority against the Democratic Party in all the Free States of this Confederacy the poor sum of 104,901 votes, and that, too, at a time when both branches of Congress were Democratic, and at a time when LINCOLN obtained a large majority, the vote against negro suffrage was thousands upon thousands, indicating that there were men in this State perfectly willing to vote for LINCOLN, intelligent, patriotic and pure members of the Republican Party, who never meant that the time would come when the negro should have political equality with the white man. [Applause.] One of the greatest pieces of jugglery, and one of the most miserable illustrations of hollow-hearted hypocrisy ever exhibited in the annals of the human race, was the pretended affection of the fanatical portion of the Republican Party for the class of beings called negroes. There was no man on the face of the earth to whom he would admit for an instant that his love of the thing called freedom, be it possessed by the most exalted on earth or the most debased or degraded, could transcend his. He knew that the love of liberty pervades the hearts of all the Democratic Party, and their mission ever had been to give liberty to all people, but not to destroy Constitutions and wreck nations. [Applause.] Did they know what become of the immense treasures expended by the great Powers of the earth to abolish Slavery on the Coast of Africa? What became of the poor negroes who were taken on board the slavers and then the slavers captured? If they were taken by an English vessel they were carried, under the form of apprentices or something akin to that away from their homes, or if they were taken by our Government that were carried to Liberia. Thus the treatment which the poor African received resulted in their still being made exiles. The particular causes which produced such a state of things, nor would he seek for a moment to justify so vile and damnable a traffic as the slave-trade, nor had the Democratic Party ever justified it in the history of the country. But when the negroes were found here, when in virtue of the inalienable right to freedom, of which the orators of a particular portion of the Republicans were so fond of prating -- what was done with them? If he believed it was the design of Almighty God that every man, of what color or complexion he might be, should enjoy precisely the same rights politically with himself and others, he did not see how he could refuse him the priviledge, and he did not understand how the Republican party, which gave a maturity for the electoral ticket that secured the choice of Mr. LINCOLN as President, could say in one breath, ""this is a man and a brother,"" (that was their sterotyped phrase,) and yet refuse to their brother the slightest exercise of any high political right. He was talking with an intelligent colored man a short time ago in this City, and on asking him if he felt a great interest in this war, he said he felt none. He (the speaker) was surprised, first at the observation, but he was not when he informed him of the conclusion which he had just stated - that he did not see how the condition of the colored race was to be benefitted if, although they were rescued from bondage, they were kept in hopeless inferiority. The State of Illinois, where they recognized the principal of freedom as the basis of their constitution, made it a criminal offence for any man whose blood was fainted as a mulatto, or a negro, to come within their territory. Mr. BRADY quoted the words of Mr. LINCOLN, delivered in Peoria to the effect that if all earthly power were given him, he should not know what to do with the existing institution of Slavery. But he had some bad instructors at Washington, who suggested to him what he had the physical though not the moral right to do. He issued a proclamation which had been the means of more injury to our cause here and abroad than almost any event which has transpired. [Loud cheers.] He did not propose to discuss that, but he would refer any gentleman fond of the study of political science to the unanswerable discussion of the proclamation by BEN. S. CURTIS, of Massachusetts, late Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JAMES T BRADY ON THE CRISIS.; He Pronounces in Favor of the Union and a Vigorous Prosecution of the War, SPEECHES OF J.

Upon this representation, ALDEN told them he wished his baggage, which consisted of a large trunk and a valise, taken to the Girard House, and gave them the checks for the purpose of obtaining them. The pretended expressmen promised to have the baggage there in an hour, instead of which they took it to the Putnam House, in Fourth-avenue. There they told the book-keeper that they were travelers, just arrived by the cars, and desired a room for the purpose of changing their dress. A room was furnished them, and the trunks taken to it. About half an hour after the two came down with new and clean suite on, and LEVY, as he passed out of the hotel, was observed to have a bundle under his arm. The suspicions of the hotel-keeper were thus aroused; the room was examined; the trunk was found broken open, and nearly everything taken away. The Police were soon notified, and the result was the arrest of both of the guilty parties. A small portion of the stolen property has been recovered, but Mr. ALDEN says that a new suit of black, valued at about $75. is missing, and also some other valuable articles.

The main body of the troops was landed under cover of gunboats at Mackey's Point, distant about fifteen miles from the railroad, and marched seven miles inland, where the enemy was met in force. A sharp fight of an hour drove him from his position, and making a second stand at a point two miles beyond, he was again compelled to retreat by our closely-pursuing troops. The rebels made a third stand at the village of Pocataligo taking she precaution to destroy the long bridge over the Pocataligo River, thereby effectually preventing further pursuit. This victory was not achieved without serious loss on our side, and the light appears to have been as hotly contested as any on a more extended scale. While these events were happening with the main body, Col.

She went on the first one to Toulon, the master paying the disbursements of her outfit by draft on his consignees at Toulon against the freight. She then returned to Mobile, and was loaded for a voyage to Ferrol, Spain. Her master had no funds to meet this second outfit, and Stewart & Murrell could not make him a loan for it, but on their advice he drew a draft on his consignees against the freight, which Stewart & Murrell procured to be negotiated for him by the libellants, who did business in New-Orleans, making a temporary loan to the master, until they received the proceeds of this draft. The vessel sailed on her voyage, but met with accident, and was prevented from delivering her cargo, so that the freight was never paid, and the master's draft was protested.

At St. Thomas the transfer, which is an almost universal accompaniment of these cases, took place, and the vessel, after running to Barcelona, (Venezuela,) to get water enough, sailed for the African coast, and on arriving in the Bight of Benin, took in eight hundred negroes in broad daylight and sailed for Cuba, where she arrived with them.

The Seymourites were earliest in the field, and sowed falsehood broadcast, which has poisoned tens of thousands of honest minds. They have taken great pains, too, to screen the prime issues of the contest, and to push forward others in their place of merely secondary account, or of no account whatever. Misapprehensions still prevail to a very mischievous extent. These need to be cleared up, and it can be done, too, if every true patriot, in his own sphere, will make himself a missionary in the work. Processions, flags, multiplied meetings, and all the other material means of stimulating energy, have figured less in this canvass than in any other for years back, owing doubtless to the comparative looseness of party organization and discipline. But energy is needed more than ever. The party questions which have ordinarily appealed to the public judgment have, been insignificant in comparison with the stupendous issues now presented.

"GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY Your intelligent and patient attention to the testimoney, and to the learned and elaborate arguments of counsel in this case, has enabled you to comprehend the facts, and will ren  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/30/archives/the-slavetrade-charge-of-judge-shipman-in-the-case-of-horn-a.html,,"GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY Your intelligent and patient attention to the testimoney, and to the learned and elaborate arguments of counsel in this case, has enabled you to comprehend the facts, and will render it unneccessary for me to do more than submit the legal principles which should guide you in coming to a conclusion. It is a well-settled rule of law that, before you can convict a prisoner charged with crime, you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt. The burden of proof to establish that guilt is on the Government. This principle rests on the well-known role that a man is to be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. If the evidence offered in support of the charge is circumstantial evidence, that evidence, when taken together, should, in order to warrant his conviction, be inconsistent with any other hypothesis than that of his guilt. These are familiar principles, applicable to the trial of all persons charged with crime. The Judge then read the statute upon which the defendant stands indicted. The first count in the indictment charges, in substance, that, on the first day of June, 1860, the defendant did, at the port of New-York, with force and arms, for himself as owner, fit out, equip and load, and otherwise prepare, a certain steamship called the City of Norfolk, and did cause said steamship to be fitted out, equipped and loaded and otherwise prepared, with intent then and there to employ her in the trade and business and, for the purpose of procuring negroes, mulattoes and persons of color from a certain foreign country -- to wit: Africa - to be transported to a certain place -- to wit: the island of Cuba -- to be held and sold and otherwise disposed of as slaves, and to be held to service and labor, against the peace and contrary to the true intent of the statute of the United States, in such case made and provided. The second count charges that the defendant, on the day aforesaid, and at this port, did, as owner, send away and cause to sail said vessel from this port, with like intent. The third count charges that he did, on the day aforesaid, not as owner, but for some other persons, as factor, fit out, equip, load and otherwise prepare said vessel, and did cause her to be fitted out, loaded and otherwise prepared, with like intent. The fourth count charges that on the day aforesaid, for some other person or persons, he sent or caused her to be sent away and sail from this port, with like intent, she having before that time been fitted out, equipped and loaded by him (the defendant) for that purpose. The fifth count charges that he aided and abetted, for himself, as owner, in fitting out, equipping and loading her for that purpose, with like intent. The sixth count charges that he aided and abetted the fitting out, loading and equipping this steamer, as factor, for others, with like intent. I give only a brief summary of the charges in the several counts, omitting the technicalities, for greater simplicity. The day on which the acts are charged is the 1st of June, 1860; but the precise day, as it may appear in the proofs, is not material. There can be no difficulty on that point, as the acts proved were done, if done at all, about that time. The acts charged, or either one of them constituting the offence, must have been done at the time of their commission with the guilty intent of the defendant, as charged in the indictment, in order to justify a verdict of guilty. The jury will then inquire whether or not the defendant did, for himself, as owner, or for others, as factor, fit out, equip and load at, and send away this steamship from this port, with the guilty intent of employing her in the unlawful business as charged in the indictment, if he did, he is guilty; if he did not, he is not guilty. There are some leading facts that are not controverted, which I will recall to the minds of the jury. This steamer was purchased by the defendant at Baltimore, and brought to this port after finishing a trip for which she was engaged to Savannah. She was sent on a voyage to Havana, in the island of Cuba. She was fitted up and improved in various ways in this port, while she continued to be owned by the defendant, and a cargo put on board of her, and in June, or about that time, she sailed from this port for the island of St. Thomas, in the West indies, in charge of Captain Zadoc A. Tilton, who was then her [???] and the acknowledged agent of the defends. After remaining at that island a few days, an alleged transfer of the steamer took place. Crawford, the first mate, who sailed in her from New-York, taking the title in his own name, and, as she was about to cast off her moorings, was delivered by Capt. Tilton into Crawford's hands, and [???] for the coast of Africa, where she arrived, took on board a large number of negroes and landed them on the Island of Cuba. She was then abandoned by her officers and crew. Now the first question that will naturally suggest itself to the Jury is, [???] the defendants thus prepare, fit out, equip and load this vessel in the port of New-York, with intent to employ her in a voyage of this character? You have heard the testimony of Beufort and Crawford, who sailed in her as officers from New-York, the latter of whom nominally owned and commanded her after she left St. Thomas, and both of whom performed, as it would seem, the entire voyage to Africa and Cuba in her. They swear that the defendant knew the purpose of the voyage at the time she was being fitted here and at the time she sailed. You will remember the details of their testimony. I am requested by the defendant's counsel to instruct you that Beufort and Crawford are accomplices, on their own confession, and that, therefore, you should not convict the defendant on their testimony, unless they are corroborated as to the material facts to which they testify. That they are accomplices there can be no doubt, and while the jury have the power, if they see fit, to convict the defendant upon the testimony of accomplices alone, it is proper, and the only safe course to require corroboration in some material points in their testimony. In weighing their testimony the jury will look at the probability of their story, at their appearance on the stand, and manner of testifying, see how far their statements agree with the undisputed facts in the case, and then say to what degree of credit they are entitled, and what degree of corroboration the jury will require in order to give their testimony full credit. They will then look to the facts disclosed in the case by the other witnesses who are not accomplices, and see if they materially and satisfactorily corroborate their testimony. I say the jury will look to the facts disclosed by others than accomplices, because one accomplice cannot be said to corroborate another. What I have here said as to the necessity of corroboration of an accomplice, will apply to any other witnesses in the case who may also be accomplices. Itwill be recollected that Mrs. Crawford testified todeclaration of the defendant, which, if true, lead to show that he had a knowledge of the guilty object of this voyage before she sailed from New-York, Mrs. Crawford is not, upon the evidence before us, an accomplice, and so far as she testifies to facts not testifies to by her husband, her statements must rest upon her personal credibility, subject to any inconsistency in, or contradiction of her story. Although she cannot in law, as the wife of an accomplice, corroborate and strengthen his particular statements, she is a competent witness, if believed by the jury, to prove any other and independent facts not sworn to by her husband, and not forming part of his acts; although those facts, if believed by the jury, fasten a guilty knowledge on this defendant. The jury will carefully weigh all that part of her testimony which details facts which took place in the absence of her husband, especially the alleged declarations of the defendant to her, or in her presence, and say whether they believe her and are satisfied from her testimony that the defendant had, at the time he fitted out, loaded and equipped this vessel, a guilty knowledge of the purpose of her voyage. If they are satisfied that he knew that this vessel was to be employed in the business which she was afterward engaged, and fitted her out and sent her away with his knowledge, the jury can have no difficulty in determining whether he did thus fit her out, equip and load her at and send her away from this port, with the guilty intent charged in the indictment. As to the extent of the fitment, it is not necessary that it should have included everything required for a successful slave voyage. If she was partially fitted here, and her equipment completed at St. Thomas, and the partial fitment here was done by the defendant, or by his directions or procurement with intent to employ her in this unlawful business, then the crime was committed, and you should find defendant guilty. It is contended by the defendant that the fitment of the vessel here, so far as he was concerned, had no connection, or was not intended by him to have any connection, will the voyage upon which she finally sailed from St. Thomas. And support of this claim Tilton's testimony and Cubelo's deposition are offered, in connection with a letter of instructions to Tilton, and some other evidence, which you will recollect. You have heard the statements of Capt. Tilton, and seen him on the stand. You will recollect that he stated that he had very little to say to Cubelo or Mandillio on the voyage out to St. Thomas, (both of them being on board,) as they talked Spanish. You have heard his statement, that he never talked with Cubelo at all at St. Thomas; and also his account of the alleged sale at St. Thomas. You will have before you also the letter of instructions of the defendant to Tilton, and the deposition of Cubelo, and the letters and papers annexed to it, and von will say whether the extraordinary transaction at St. Thomas, which is termed a sale of this vessel, was a bona fide transaction on the part of Tilton, or whether it was a device to cover a guilty enterprise and conceal the guilty projectors of it. If you are satisfied that the transaction was a mere pretence and cover, and that it was so understood by Tilton, who is an old and experienced shipmaster, then you will say how far he is entitled to credit in the other parts of his testimony. If you are satisfied that this transaction at St. Thomas was a sham, it does not necessarily follow that the defendant authorized it. But you will look further, and see what was the conduct of the defendant when this transaction of his agent, Tilton, was made to known to him. Did he dissent from it, and call Tilton to an account for it? Or did he approve it, or silently acquiesce in it -- in this transaction, in which he had so large an interest? If you find that the defendant did approve or silently acquiesced in this transaction, after its true character became known to him, you will say whether or not it was part of an original scheme in which the fitting out of this vessel at this port was included, and in which the defendant was a participator, with a guilty knowledge and intent. On this point you will consider the facts in connection with the defendant's conduct after the capture of the vessel was known to him, after Crawford and Beaufort returned to this City. If this was a sham sale, and this vessel in which the defendant had so large an interest, had, by thee fraud or recklessness of Capt. Tilton, paused into the hands or under the control of Mandillio, who was guilty of a crime against the defendant, Crawford was an accomplice and Beaufort a tool of Mandillio. The jury should then inquire, from the evidence, what the conduct of the defendant was toward Crawford and Beaufort after they returned to this City. Did he approve or silently acquiesce in what they had done? If the Jury find that he approved or silently acquiesced in their acts after the vessel arrived at St. Thomas, and after she sailed on her unlawful voyage, they will say whether the whole circumstances of the case taken together, which they find proved beyond a reasonable doubt, are consistent with any other hypothesis than that the defendant fitted out this vessel at and sent her from this port, with intent to employ her in the unlawful business in which she engaged. If the whole conduct of the defendant, taken together, from first to last, as the jury shall find it proved beyond a reasonable doubt, is consistent with any hypothesis that admits of his innocence, then he should not be convicted; but if that conduct is inconsistent with any other hypothesis, except that of his guilt, then their verdict should be guilty. The whole case is with the jury. If they are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, he is entitled to the benefit of a doubt and to an acquittal. If they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty, they will render a verdict accordingly.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE SLAVE-TRADE.; Charge of Judge Shipman in the Case of Horn A verdict of Guilty.

"I go for sustaining the Government in crushing this rebellion."" Thus says Col. MCLEOD MURPHY in his letter accepting the Congressional nomination of the Union Republicans for the Ninth. That's the talk! Sustain the. Government, and not drag it down as SEYMOUR advocates. Crush the rebellion, and not bargain with it, as the WOODS and all their tribe hope to do. Col. MURPHY, though a Democrat, has sterling stuff in him. He shows it in his acts, as his splendid discipline and as his riddled banners testify.

It is extremely hard for an American community to believe that it is in any real danger. We have indulged in exaggerations so long that simple truth does not arouse us.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/10/31/archives/a-word-to-loyal-democrats.html,,"It is extremely hard for an American community to believe that it is in any real danger. We have indulged in exaggerations so long that simple truth does not arouse us. At every local election for petty offices, during the last twenty years, we have heard the cry that revolution was at hand, and that one party or the other was aiming to destroy our liberties. The choice of a Town Clerk or County Commissioner produced enough terrific oratory to have heralded a second French Revolution. The Federalists, and next the Whigs, were always about to sell the whole United States to the tyrant, England, and then erect a monarchy; and the Democrats were preparing the populace for anarchy and Red Republicanism. When, at length, two years ago, the real wolf came which had been cried so long, and no one believed in it. We could not, for a time, conceive it possible that there could be genuine conspirators against the glorious Republic. We thought the Southern threats a part of the usual heroics which accompany an election defeat. In our simplicity we allowed the traitors and plotters to disarm us and equip themselves for a terrible struggle, without ever believing that they were in earnest. 80 confirmed was this scepticism in the Northern mind of any real danger to the country that but for the keen sense and resolute will of an eminent military man, we should have been aroused from our unbelief by the capture of Washington and the inauguration of a revolutionary Southern administration. The national mind had fed on bombastic oratory and exaggerated rhetoric so long, that it almost lost the sense of reality and simplicity when they were at last presented to it. We never imagined that all our grand figures of Treason assailing the palladium of Liberty, and CATALINE betraying the Republic, and the fair fields of America drenched in civil blood, were ever to be fully realized in our own experience. We said, up to the very last moment, till the thunders of Sumter fell on our incredulous cars, ""Oh, this is an election trick! The South will never secede. They will all come in again in sixty days!"" And even now, when Treason has stained half a continent with brothers' blood; when the pillars of the Republic tremble to the base, and another year may see anarchy and civil war extended even through the Free States, and the Southern Confederacy triumphant and unassailable, we cannot make thousands of our best citizens see that there is any danger at all. They only say, ""Oh, that is an election trick of the Republicans! It will be all right when SEYMOUR is in, and the Democracy have the power. The liberties of America can never be stricken down by her own sons.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Word to Loyal Democrats.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Word to Loyal Democrats.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-10-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6dc27952-1ae4-523e-839a-04002bab4b50,921,nyt://article/6dc27952-1ae4-523e-839a-04002bab4b50,
