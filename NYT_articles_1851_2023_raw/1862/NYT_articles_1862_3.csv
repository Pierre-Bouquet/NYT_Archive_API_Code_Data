The Primary Departments, both male and female, exhibited fair proficiency in the ordinary routine branches' as history, geography, elocution, &c. The highest class in the Female Department sustained themselves with great credit, and reflected honor upon their preceptress, MISS EMMA L. THOMPSON, late matron of the Military Hospital in Alexandria. This young lady procured leave of absence from the school officers at the commencement of the nursing movement, but has since returned to her former sphere of duty. The ""Robinson Zouaves"" form the most novel feature of this school, and they look upon their daily drill as a pleasant episode in their course of studies. The erect bearing and soldierly precision of movement upon the part of the young cadets, was an additional attraction to the exercises of the class.

Editorial estimates number of Confederate soldiers in Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/01/archives/the-rebel-forces-in-virginia.html,Editorial estimates number of Confederate soldiers in Virginia,"If, within six days, or six months, the army of the Potomac should march against Manassas, or outflank it, or take it in the rear, or attack or circumvent it in any other way, or from any possible angle, what would be the probable number of rebels attacked, or outflanked, or left isolated and helpless in that formidable stronghold? We know that, nine months ago, the rebel Congress authorized DAVIS to raise four hundred thousand soldiers for his defence; we know that all the rebel newspapers have proclaimed, over and over again, that the whole fighting population of the South had rushed to arms, or were about to do so, and had gone, or were at once going, to the points menaced by invasion; we know that the secession organ of this City has twice published pretended lists of the rebel regiments, of immense length, and that in one of its estimates it gave the number of regiments at four hundred and fifty, while in another it stated the rebel force in the field at 496,000 men. JEFF. DAVIS, also, in his Inaugural, the other day, said that a million men in arms now confronted each other, and we know certainly that not over half of that number are in our army. We know, on the other hand, that the rebel imagination delights in tropes and hyperboles; we know that the Herald has an end, if not a master to serve, by its preposterous estimates; and we know that the rebel figures of number, as well as their figures of speeeh, have been remarkably belied in our late encounters in the Southwest. The rebel army at Bowling Green had been ordinarily estimated as high as sixty to seventy-five thousand; that at Columbus from forty to sixty thousand; while from Nashville, Memphis, and other points, we have had secession estimates that would run the entire rebel force in the Southwest up to at least half of DAVIS' half million. But we know pretty well that after Bowling Green had reinforced Fort Donelson with 10,000 men, there was not much more than that number left to retreat to Murfreesboro'; and if the force now evacuating Columbus counts anything like forty or sixty thousand, it will be a remarkable movement for such a body -- even if it be a rebel body. It is possible enough that for various reasons, the rebels may have exaggerated, in an equal degree, the strength of their force on the Potomac. When they have talked wildly about two or three hundred thousand fierce and furious soldiers stationed there, it may be that they over calculated by the matter of (say) one or two hundred thousand. We know that at Bull Run, where all the available forces were concentrated, BEAUREGARD states the number of men engaged and on the field at an exceedingly low figure; we know that if their soldiers were counted by a very large number of hundreds of thousands, they would be likely to send much heavier forces to defend the important strategic points BURNSIDE is now seizing in North Carolina; and there are many other reasons to doubt that they have any such huge masses of troops as they claim. We would not under-estimate the numbers or the courage of the rebel soldiers on the Potomac. We doubt not that both are great. But one hundred thousand we believe to be a large estimate for the whole body. A letter just arrived in this City from a discreet and reliable person in Richmond, states the number at sixty thousand; but this is, perhaps, somewhat below the mark. But still, there is no doubt that it is much nearer the truth than the prodigious figures with which the rebels have so long frightened us.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Forces in Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Forces in Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab1b96e9-8b92-5004-9b0c-ee6c111becb0,629,nyt://article/ab1b96e9-8b92-5004-9b0c-ee6c111becb0,

reports from Columbus indicate evacuation by Confederates,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/01/archives/the-rebellion.html,reports from Columbus indicate evacuation by Confederates,"JEFF. DAVIS' first regular Message to the ""permanent"" rebel Government is published this morning. It is a very curious and significant document. He says that his Government had attempted more than it could achieve, and in its effort to protect the whole of its territory, it had encountered disasters. He has not yet received the official reports of the discomfitures at Roanoke or Donelson; the Roanoke affair, however, was deeply humiliating; and he is unwilling to believe that a large army surrendered at Fort Donelson without a desperate effort to cut its way through the enemy. But strenuous efforts have been made to send reinforcements to the threatened positions; and the disappointments will nerve the people to still greater exertions. He opposes the policy of enlistments for short terms, and urges the soldiers to reinlist for the war. He cannot tell the present strength of his army, but estimates it at 400 regiments of infantry, with cavalry and artillery. He thinks the whole body of new levies and reenlisted men will be ready within thirty days. His army was at present so disorganized as to impair its ability for successful defence. His navy is in a satisfactory condition. His finances are prosperous, he has no floating debt, and the expenditures have only been $170,000,000! His postage system is steadily improving. In closing he assures his Congress of his hearty cooperation in all its efforts. Our military authorities will doubtless not be blind to some of the important facts mentioned by the President of the so-styled Confederate States.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b906d266-0a67-527d-9b46-fbfe7b756f2b,1074,nyt://article/b906d266-0a67-527d-9b46-fbfe7b756f2b,

There have been many causeless insurrections; rebellions have often appeared on the page of history, but never before was there such a rebellion as this.

"The San Francisco Bulletin of Feb. 1 says ""H.A. Perry, the well-known actor, died this forenoon about 11 o'clock, at his residence on Jackson-street, between Powell and Stockton streets, of consumption. About a twelvemonth ago, when playing in the interior, he caught cold, which soon settled on his lungs, and proved fatal in the end. For the last few months he has been closely confined to his house, and for six weeks or more has not left his bed-chamber. Mr. Perry was born in Philadelphia, on Christmas Day, 1826, and was therefore, when he died, entering the thirty-seventh year of his age. When quite a boy, he used to work in a stable, and ride horse races. Tiring of this business, he ran off and learned the tailoring trade; but having a hankering, for the atricals, before long went on the boards. He made his first appearance on the stage, when about 19 years old, at the Walnut-street Theatre, in Philadelphia, in the character of Malcolm, in 'Macbeth.' In 1851 he was leading man at the Broadway Theatre, New-York. Afterwards he traveled in company with Julia Dean for two years; and, leaving her, 'starred' it for two years more in the Western cities. He next played in New-York, in Burton's company, and soon after 'starred' it through the Canadas and the States. He played in Wood & McVicar's company, in St. Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago; again at the Walnut, in 1859, and later, at Niblo's Garden, New-York. Two years ago, he arrived here, and made debut, if we recollect aright, at the old Lyceum Theatre, in the character of Othello. Since then he has been almost constantly on the boards in this city, except during his last illness, and when he made an occasional professional visit to the interior towns. Frequenters of the Opera House will recollect him as the leading actor, if not the most valuable one, in the excellent stock company which the management of that theatre had collected during the last year or two.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/02/archives/obituary.html,,"The San Francisco Bulletin of Feb. 1 says ""H.A.

Editorial praises loyalty to Union in eastern Tennessee,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/02/archives/an-extraordinary-scene-in-east-tennessee.html,Editorial praises loyalty to Union in eastern Tennessee,"We have had many proofs of the extraordinary loyalty and devotion to the Union of the patriots of East Tennessee. But an article which we publish this morning, from the Knoxville Register, (a rebel sheet) of a late date, exhibits a state of affairs more remarkable than anything of which we have heretofore heard. It appears that some months ago, the Unionists in that part of the State were organized for a general uprising against the rebel despotism, and armed themselves, and assembled in bodies in quite a number of counties; but the [Secessionist authorities, both State and Confederate, dispatched large columns of rebel troops there, who succeeded, by means of the sword, the halter and the dungeon, in suppressing these Union outbreaks. Part of the evidence which appeared on the trial of some of these Union men is given; and one thrilling scene is brought to light which, as showing the spirit of these men, is worth reiterating here. It was in the wild mountain regions of Greene County, in the extreme eastern part of the State. A party of thirty or forty Unionists were gathered together late at night, discussing their plans of operation against the rebels. While thus engaged, Col. FRY, since famous as the killer of ZOLLICOFFER, alighted from his horse, and bounded into the yard, exclaiming, ""Friends! I am Col. FRY, and I am come to share with you."" He addressed his fellow-loyalists, who were unanimous in their expressions of approbation, and with one accord determined that he should be their leader, and that they would follow him, if necessary, to death.

So eager have the community been to hear these lectures, that, in order to get a seat in the Academy of Music, it was necessary to be there an hour before the lecture commenced. Prof. AGASSIZ proposed to complete, in the last lecture, so far as the limits would allow, the demonstration of a plan in the order of succession of animals, which implies thought, deliberation and the direct intervention of an intelligent Creator. Nowhere is the evidence of plan more plain than in the radiated animals. As the basis of their structure we may take the Sphere. For though the plan of radiation, as exhibited in these animals, is not a mathematical sphere, it is, nevertheless, an organic sphere; it is a sphere in which there is as much variation as can well be introduced upon the idea of radiation. And the first difference we notice is this: that instead of the outer structure bearing a relation to a central point, it bears a relation to an axis which extends from pole to pole. The living sphere, as shown in the radiated animals, comes nearer to a revolving sphere, which is the axis of revolution, having two poles and an equator. This axis is surrounded by parts which are identical in their nature, and which bear the same relation to one another and to a central axis. But the two poles are essentially different. Now, if we present the problem of radiation in a mathematical point of view, it would be this: How to execute with the elements given -- with a vertical axis, around which are arranged parts of equal value -- all the possible variations involved in that plan. This question I have actually submitted to one of our great mathematicians. I requested him to solve the problem, how to devise structures variously executed, the elements being given, without introducing any new elements. His answer was readily given, and it was this: To represent the whole sphere as a series of wedges placed side by side. To make this demonstration clear I will take for illustration the melon with its ribbed surface, or the orange whose internal part is composed of a number of spherical wedges which are all equal. Now in executing any structure upon the idea of radiation, the simplest way would be to gather around the axis a number of these spherical wedges until the whole space is occupied. There would be a larger or smaller number according to the angle of the two sides of the wedge, so that by varying the thickness of the wedges we could introduce at once a variety of structure.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LECTURES OF PROF.

The fleet, he said, is under the command of Commodore HOLLINS. The boats are all iron-clad; much more heavily plated than ours, and less vulnerable. Their machinery is all below the gun decks. In this respect they are equal to the Benton, the best boat of the United States fleet. The rebel officer further stated that it is the intention of Commodore HOLLINS to make an attack on Cairo, and that speedily. 'Mark my prediction, you will find these boats before Fort Holt in less than ten days,' was one of the remarks which I heard him make. The rumor of a contemplated attack on Cairo has spread no little consternation among the people here, and if the rebels really have the kind of fleet I have just described, their apprehensions are not altogether groundless.

We give herewith a diagram of the river from Columbus down to that position, by which the character and bearings of the Island will be seen. No. 10, as we have already stated, is one of the innumerable small islands in the Mississippi River, the numbering of which begins just below Cairo. It is very near the line separating the State of Kentucky from Tennessee. It is probably about a mile long and a half a mile wide. It is nearly opposite the village of Obionville, at which heavy works were thrown up by negro laborers last Autumn. The island is one hundred and sixty miles above Memphis, and nine hundred miles above New-Orleans. The rebels hope from this point to stop the descent of our gunboats down the river to assault Memphis. They boast that they can at once render the position impregnable.

Most of the business during that period has been transacted by the clerks of the Warehouse Department, the receipts from the duties on bonded goods approaching $200,000 some days of the week. This sum is much greater than that usually received from this source of revenue; indeed there have been but few days in many years when the sum paid equaled that named. The explanation of this sudden increase of duties received is probably as follows: During the past month or two large quantities of goods of certain descriptions have been placed in bond. The largest invoices thus warehoused have been of sugar, coffee and tea, the last two of which are articles which under the former tariff laws were scarcely ever bonded, inasmuch as they were allowed entry free of duty. The high rates of duty now levied on the three articles mentioned force the importers of them to take advantage of the warehousing privilege, and the result of their so doing has been the deposit of millions of pounds of them in public store since the beginning of the year. The passage of the Treasury Note Bill with the important amendment requiring duties to be paid in the demand notes of the first issue, or in coin, together with the probability of the passage of a new tariff act, which the importers, in their timidity, fear may take effect on the goods already imported and in bond, has caused the owners of such merchandise to withdraw it as quickly as possible. In thus doing, they have found it necessary to demand Treasury notes at the banks with which to pay their duties at the custom-house; here they met with a difficulty which they had not foreseen -- the banks having been so particular, of late, about receiving demand-notes in large sums, were destitute of the required quantity. A large proportion of the duties received have been from the articles already mentioned.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CUSTOM HOUSE.; BUSINESS OF THE PAST WEEK ACTIVITY IN THE WAREHOUSE DEPARTMENT THE CHARACTER OF THE GOODS WITHDRAWN HEAVY PAYMENTS OF DUTY ON COFFEE, SUGAR, ETC.

The mileage of the public works, the canals and railroads of the United States, exceeds, those of all other nations. They enable us to fill the warehouses of Liverpool, Havre and Bremen with wheat and corn grown 2,500 miles inland, and 6,000 miles from the consumers In their construction, we have only taken advantage of the provisions that nature kindly made in our favor. To adapt it to our wants, the Continent had to be reconstructed, by diverting its great rivers from their natural outlets, which were in inhospitable climes, far distant from the convenient seats of population, industry and commerce of the continent. The first grand achievement, the Eric Canal, turned the waters, and with them the commerce of the great lakes, into our harbor. The work has been improved till its capacity has been increased five fold. It now floats what a few years ago would have been a ship of very respectable tonnage for ocean service. Through this work there were delivered at tide-water the past year nearly 2,000,000 tons of breadstuff's, the shipment of which to foreign countries kept the balance of trade in our favor, and saved us from National bankruptcy But for this work, so noiseless, yet so efficent in its action, the rebellion would have proved, as it has been esteemed, a success.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/03/archives/the-union-cause-in-tennessee.html,,"It would, perhaps, be premature to attempt a, reliable estimate of the popular sentiment in Tennessee, taking the State altogether, on the question of the rebellion. The extreme leaders in the violent and desperate act of separation last June, and a large portion of the Press, have not yet abated their madness if we are to judge by the last received newspaper extracts from Nashville and Memphis and some of the rumors by telegraph and through the Virginia papers. In reference to the Nashville extracts, we remark that most of them bear date before the rebel disaster a Fort Donelson. That result probably modified the temper of the editors toward the old Union. The change would not be as violent at heart as it would appear in contrast will their recent belligerent attitude. The leading journal of the city, the Republican Banner, went into the Confederate cause with the utmost reluctance, and has since manifested nothing more than a con strained support, under the plea of maintaining the independence of the State agains what is called Federal coercion. One or more of the others were Union journals to the latest moment before HARRIS and his Legislature precipitated the people into revolution. The large and wealthy County of Davidson, in which the City of Nashville and the Capitol buildings of the State are located, was largely Union in sentiment to the same unfortunate period. The interests of its people were with the Union, their most intimate social relations with Kentucky and Missouri, and their best trade with Cincinnati and the North. The property-holders, both town and country, had their dearest stake and security in the Government of the United States. For more than thirty years, first under the leadership of JACKSON and then of JOHN BELL, they had contemned the nullification and secession doctrines of South Carolina, and at one time, in the Summer of 1850, came near driving out of the city a Southern State Rights Convention, for plotting in their midst the separation of the Union. To say that these people are not ready to return to their allegiance, on the well-assured fact that our beneficent Government and its present Administration mean them no harm, to the rights of person or property, and have no other object than to put down this unnatural rebellion, and restore peace and security to their firesides, and freedom to their trade and intercourse with their old neighbors and friends, would be to utterly ignore all their political antecedents.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Union Cause in Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Union Cause in Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5d40b39b-3911-5baf-be03-bbc5d74e3071,820,nyt://article/5d40b39b-3911-5baf-be03-bbc5d74e3071,

Editorial observations on Beauregard activities,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/03/archives/beauregard-in-a-new-role-when-the.html,Editorial observations on Beauregard activities,"rebel fortunes began to wane in the Southwest, after the fall of the stronghold at Mill Spring, BEAUREGARD was dispatched there to examine the various fortified positions held by the rebels, and to render them even more impregnable than they were -- if there be degrees of impregnability. The Southwestern rebels became jubilant as the hero of Sumter and Manassas approached. His presence was considered equivalent to a reinforcement of ten thousand ordinary rebels. If, heretofore, Bowling Green and Columbus, and the Forts on the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers, had kept at bay the mighty armies under BUELL and HALLECK, then, after BEAUREGARD took control of them, they could defy the whole Yankee nation in arms. The great fortifier arrived at Nashville. He scanned the defences of the city with his engineering eye, and speedily passed up to Bowling Green. There he remained some time, and thence returned to Nashville. He had hardly got away from Bowling Green, however, before the rebels there began to fly from their impregnable works. They fled from Bowling Green, from Nashville, from Murfreesboro, and are still fleeing. BEAUREGARD next rushed westward to strengthen by his presence and his genius Columbus, the Sebastopol of the West, a place at whose defences the engineer of Camargo himself had labored for half a year, and which was blessed with the prayers and strengthened by the science of the reverend POLK. Add to these things BEAUREGARD, and of what avail would be the power of our armies, or the shot and shell of our river fleet? But no sooner had BEAUREGARD arrived at Columbus, than the other rebels began to run away; and now, this impregnable position, too, is in turn evacuated. Wherever BEAUREGARD goes now, he seems to be but the herald of evacuation. The rebels have heretofore declared that Memphis was impregnable, and that ""Island No. 10"" could easily be rendered so. But BEAUREGARD had not then visited those points. When he does reach them, and particularly if our Western army be not far off, there is little doubt, judging from the past, that he and the other rebels will suddenly evacuate. This rebel charlatan built up a sort of reputation on the strength of his bombardment of Fort Sumter, his fortifications at Manassas, and the fiasco at Bull Run. But his invincibility, even in rebel eyes, must now be gone.

Gen. BUELL telegraphed, on Saturday night, to Gen. McCLELLAN, that Murfreesboro had been abandoned by the rebels, who were retreating along the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, tearing up the rails as they proceeded, thus rendering pursuit difficult. It was announced in our dispatches, yesterday, that the rebels were concentrating at Chattanooga, and this dispatch from Gen. BUELL renders this probable. Chattanooga, although in Tennessee, is very near the Georgia line, and the railroad passes through the northeast corner of Alabama, and touches the Georgia line before reaching it. A great change is found to have occurred already in the political feeling in Tennessee, and the War Department feels itself warranted in taking measures immediately to raise and arm volunteer troops in that State. The important announcement is also made by authority, in our dispatches this morning, that the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers will be opened this week to free and unrestricted commerce, under the order of the Secretary of the Treasury.

Editorial on imprisoned Confederate Gen. Buckner,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/03/archives/buckner-in-winter-quarters.html,Editorial on imprisoned Confederate Gen. Buckner,"After a somewhat checkered pilgrimage, Gen. BUCKNER has, we learn, been safely lodged in Fort Warren, Boston harbor, where he will be held as a prisoner of war, till the end of the rebellion. We mention this with a sense of satisfaction which arises not merely from the fact of having so notorious a traitor in our hands, but also because there was some appearance, a little while ago, that another fate, and one that could not have failed to have caused embarrassment to the Union cause, was about to be visited upon him. It may be remembered that immediately on the capture of BUCKNER, and his transfer as a prisoner to Cairo, Judge CATRON issued a warrant for his arrest, and ten days ago, the telegraph announced that the robe General had been delivered to the Unite States Marshal, and was about to be taken to Kentucky to stand his trial before the highest tribunal of his country on the charge of treason. While fully appreciating the motive that led the noble old patriot-judge -- himself an exile from his native State of Tennessee, on account of his unflinching devotion to the Union -- to seek to bring the traitor chief to swift justice, we did not hesitate to express the opinion that the time had not yet come for a proper adjudication of the case. We are left to infer that the Administration took the same view, and that Executive interference was exercised to arrest the legal proceedings and restore the rebel General to the status of a prisoner of war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Buckner in Winter Quarters.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Buckner in Winter Quarters.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4ffdea2-9205-5f3d-be46-7a766399bd1c,1071,nyt://article/e4ffdea2-9205-5f3d-be46-7a766399bd1c,

Editorial on rapid succession of Union victories in Southwest,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/04/archives/following-up-successesrapid-and-brilliant-movements-in-the.html,Editorial on rapid succession of Union victories in Southwest," -- The complaints heretofore so frequently and justly made of the failure of our military leaders to follow up the successes achieved at different points, do not, certainly, apply to the Generals commanding in the Southwest. On the 6th of last month Fort Henry was assailed and taken; on the 12th our army was before Fort Donelson, and on the 16th, after three days' fighting, the fort fell; on the 17th our army was in Clarksville; on the 22d it was in Nashville, over a hundred miles above Fort Donelson; and now it is again in pursuit of the flying enemy. By these operations we compelledthe rebels to evacuate Bowling Green, Russelville and Gallatin, which were at once occupied by detachments of our troops; we also compelled them to evacuate Columbus and Hickman, which are likewise, doubtless, now in our possession. Neither have our Western columns paused yet anywhere to rest, or to fortify, or to battle with the enemy's pickets. A second gunboat reconnoissance has been made up into Alabama; and the officer in command has, in an official dispatch, asked for a detachment of troops to go to a point in that State; from three other directions in Tennessee, also, operations are going on. looking to the possession of points only second in importance to Nashville, and which, if they prove successful, will speedily entirely rid the State of rebel soldiers. If, when Fort Henry was captured, Gen. GRANT had sat down and commenced strengthening his position -- if he had begun operations against unhappy newspaper reporters, or made an attempt to solve the Slavery question, the probability is that the rebels would by this time have had Clarksville so strongly fortified, and the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers so thickly lined with batteries, as to preclude any movement of our army or navy for mouths; while the rebel Legislature at Nashville would have gone on binding Tennessee still more firmly to the Government of JEFF. DAVIS, and the cruel persecution of Union men would still have been carried on all over the State.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOLLOWING UP SUCCESSES--RAPID AND BRILLIANT MOVEMENTS IN THE SOUTHWEST.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOLLOWING UP SUCCESSES--RAPID AND BRILLIANT MOVEMENTS IN THE SOUTHWEST.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/336c894d-f161-559a-bfca-17dedc471119,498,nyt://article/336c894d-f161-559a-bfca-17dedc471119,

To my regret, however, I have been unable, since the trial, to devote any time to the case, and some weeks must elapse before I can give the case that attention which it deserves. A further delay in the decision would be unjust to the parties, especially as the result of any consideration I might give the case, and any decision I might make, would not be final, or materially aid the parties. The amount in controversy, and the nature and difficulty of the questions involved in the action under it, render it certain that the judgment of this Court, at Special or General Term, will be but steps in the progress of the suit -- the judgment of the Court of last resort only will terminate the litigation, and it is fit that it should be so in a case of this character and importance.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rose Will Case.; SUPREME COURT SPECIAL TERM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rose Will Case.; SUPREME COURT SPECIAL TERM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d85c670-bb65-518e-95d6-8723cb883066,374,nyt://article/4d85c670-bb65-518e-95d6-8723cb883066,

The Memphis papers confirm the news we have previously had of our army movements in Central Tennessee; but the Appeal says that a deep gloom pervades the citizens of Nashville, and that they avoid intercourse with the invaders. The journals strongly urge the rebel Government to pursue an aggressive policy. The State Legislature met at Memphis on the 27th, but adjourned for want of a quorum. An election for local officers had been held in Hardin County, Tenn., and the Union ticket was chosen by a light vote but a heavy majority. Railroad communication between Louisville and Nashville will be at once resumed. The mails, so far as soldiers' letters are concerned, now run regularly to Nashville. At a municipal election at the latter city, the retiring Mayor promised the citizens Federal protection, if they remained quiet.

The recent proclamation of the British Government, prohibiting armed vessels of either the United States or the rebels from entering any British port, (a measure which, by the way, they were moved to adopt in consequence of the nervous flutter caused by the arrival at Southampton of the U.S. gunboat Tuscarora, to lie in wait for this very Nashville,) was in reality a death-blow to the rebel privateers; and the valiant PEGRAM, seeing his chivalrous occupation of burning defenceless merchantmen gone, doubtless thought it prudent to turn his pirate prow homeward, and run the chance of dodging into some rebel rat-hole. Accordingly, on the 3d of February, the Nashville left Southampton -- the sinister twenty-four hours' law, adopted by the British authorities, giving her two hundred miles start, (a British man-of-war, with ports open, stood guard over the Tuscarora while the rebel vessel steamed down the Solent,) and rendering pursuit useless. The game having escaped, the Tuscarora is reported to have proceeded to the Mediterranean to watch the remaining pirate ship, the Sumter; and the Nashville was left free to make her way back to the American shores of the Atlantic, where she turns up at Wilmington, N.C., after running the blockade.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Nashville at Wilmington.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Nashville at Wilmington.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a9e6b336-c047-5760-864b-9c1270abdf5a,466,nyt://article/a9e6b336-c047-5760-864b-9c1270abdf5a,

Nearly every class will probably find something to complain of -- ofundue burthens in one direction -- of in. equalities in another; and, it may be, of (suppressed) opposition in the third. But in the main, we have a right to assume, that the provisions of the bill have been as justly balanced as the nature of this mode of taxation would permit, and that the weighty burthens are made to fall upon the articles and occupations which are best able to support them. But whether this be strictly so or not, it would be utterly impossible to frame a system of excise and income taxes to please all parties, and the very best compromise to be aimed at, in the present condition of the country, the exigences of the Government and the paramount duty of maintaining the public credit, is that which shall secure the most certain as well as the amplest revenue at the lightest expense and annoyance of collection.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Internal Tax Bill.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Internal Tax Bill.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cd1ecab9-4d39-5677-a063-8d1da293af5f,801,nyt://article/cd1ecab9-4d39-5677-a063-8d1da293af5f,
Editorial on Government suppression of war news,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/04/archives/the-suppression-of-war-news.html,Editorial on Government suppression of war news,"The first law of political economy is that mischief always results from intermeddling with the laws of trade. Interference with the currents of public intelligence and opinion is no less hazardous. Yesterday the City was agitated with the most painful rumors in regard to the military events of last week. It was freely asserted on the voucher of private authority, that Gen. BANKS, after passing the Potomac, had met with a serious disaster; that Gen. LANDER had been killed in battle; that the reverse would cause a postponement of operations for a fortnight at least. It was equally current that the conduct of Gen. McCLELLAN had incurred the severest censure of the administration, insomuch that a substitute would have to be found for him before a general advance should be made in earnest. Wild and improbable as these rumors were, they were in the mouths of everybody. They carried dismay to thousands of hearts; they depressed the stock market. In the ordinary course of things, nothing of the sort could have happened. So long as the public had reason to confide in the Press having full and authentic details of all that was occurring, it had only to inspect the bulletin board, or await the evening edition, to correct flying rumors. But the order of the War Department has changed this. The lies contrived by the malicious and mischievous, or by the speculator anxious to affect the movements of Wall-street, have now Government warrant for their currency; while the truth is placed in the index. No obstruction stands in the way of the freest circulation of falsehood; the War Office censorship applies only to facts.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Suppression of War News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Suppression of War News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf4c0aa3-e414-5f2f-8a1c-a62432931550,818,nyt://article/cf4c0aa3-e414-5f2f-8a1c-a62432931550,

It is stated that in New-York there are at present more than six thousand public prostitutes, the majority of whom are from fifteen to twenty-five years of age. Three-eighths of the number are natives of this country; many of them, born abroad, came here poor, but virtuous, and hoped to improve their condition and gain a respectable place in society by emigrating to a free country. The average duration of life among these degraded victims of licentiousness is only four years. But, though their numbers are thus thinned by the ravages of disease and death, the fallen sisterhood is continually augmenting. Destitution, intemperance, seduction, and other causes, recruit their ranks. A capital of neatly four millions of dollars is invested in this horrid traffic in infamy; and an annual expenditure of more than seven millions of dollars shows the vast proportions which the social evil has assumed in this City. Under these circumstances, it is surprising that so little has heretofore, been done to protect or reclaim those young women who, though fallen, long for an opportunity to rise again, to abandon evil courses, and to take some humble and useful place in society. In Europe great success has attended the operations of Magdalen Asylums, and it has, therefore, been determined by some, of our influential philanthropic citizens to adopt a similar plan in this City. We hope that the meeting which is to be held this evening in furtherance of these views will be largely attended.

How can it be otherwise? Consider the innumerable subjects which come before Congress from all parts of the country, in respect to each one of which Congress is required to adopt the best measure practicable. It is not possible but that in many things it should fail merely from ignorance. It is impossible that all of its members should thoroughly investigate every subject for themselves, and they do not do it. In many, if not most cases, the great mass rely upon the statements of some one who they think ought to know the facts of the case, while, if they were to inquire into it, they would perhaps find that he was acting upon entirely erroneous information, received, perhaps, from a biased or an interested source. It is the easiest thing in the world to be mistaken as to facts, and in consequence to adopt erroneous views or urge mistaken measures. Take, for instance, the proposed bill creating a Solicitor of Customs, which was urged mainly upon two grounds, both of which, on investigation, proved to be entirely erroneous. If the bill is ever brought up before Congress, we shall not beat all surprised to see them both brought up again, and the bill urged forward on the ground of those mythical six hundred suite against the Government, and that mythical $20,000 a year paid by the Government to extra counsel in revenue cases.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Relief for the United States District Court.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Relief for the United States District Court.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f71fda28-5d07-5b27-b969-76eb601f520d,906,nyt://article/f71fda28-5d07-5b27-b969-76eb601f520d,

editorial on occupation,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/05/archives/colonization-of-discrowned-heads-in-america.html,editorial on occupation,"There can be no longer any doubt touching the intention of the Allies to make an effort to impose a king on Mexico. Earl RUSSELL'S declaration, in a letter quoted in these columns the other day sets the matter at rest. ""If the Mexican people,"" says his lordship, ""by a spontaneous movement place the Austrian Archduke on the throne, there is nothing in the Convention to prevent it."" Of course not. It if Mexican people, of their own free will, think proper to abjure republicanism, and to give themselves a master, in the person of the Archduke MAXIMILIAN, they have an unquestionable right to do so. But if a throne be not erected in Mexico, and MAXIMILIAN do not wear a crown, until this happens, it is not very probable that either event will ever occur; and if they should occur through the instrumentality of the ballot-box, and foreign mercenaries, and domestic traitors, that will be no more a ""spontaneous movement,"" on the part of the Mexican people, than the surrender of his purse to the bandit is a spontaneous movement on the part of the helpless wayfarer. Whatever be the result, however, the combined Powers, we presume, are determined to make the experiment in Mexico; but, should they succeed there, it must not be concluded that they will then rest from their labors. Ambition grows by what it feeds on, and success in Mexico will not improbably encourage them to repeat the operation in the other Spanish-American Republics. Those Republics have been all offenders, in the same way, if not to the same extent, as their more Northern sister; like her, they are debtors to European capitalists; like her, they are turbulent and anarchical. Hence there will be just as valid ground for intervention in their case, as in Mexico. But is not the idea too absurd to have been conceived by that coalition? Not at all. The Church of Rome has her Society for the Propagation of the Faith; why should there not also exist an Association of States for the propagation of king, craft?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Colonization of Discrowned Heads in America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Colonization of Discrowned Heads in America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/13b4221a-c236-5477-a6f1-b9ec8fd26ef2,811,nyt://article/13b4221a-c236-5477-a6f1-b9ec8fd26ef2,

"In the House of Lords, on the 14th ult., the Earl of STANNOPE rose to put a question to the Foreign Secretary in reference to a report which had just reached this country that a second squadron of ships, laden with stone, had been dispatched by the Government of the United States, to be sunk in Maffitt's Channel, in front of Charleston harbor, and also that a third squadron, laden in a similar manner, was in progress of equipment for a similar object. He wished to know from the noble Earl whether he had received any dispatches from Washington in confirmation of that report, and, if so, what course he intended to take in the matter. The former dispatches of the noble Earl had laid before the American Government in so comprehensive a form, and with such unanswerable arguments, the considerations which ought to guide them in regard to such enterprises, that he had hoped that it had settled the question. [Hear, hear.] That dispatch seemed to be a most worthy sequel to the policy with respect to American affairs, which all parties were agreed in thinking had done so much credit to the noble Earl, and had so fully vindicated the honor of the country, and to the approbation which had already been bestowed on that policy he begged to add his humble meed of praise. It was difficult to see how the sinking of large ships laden with stone on banks of mud at the entrance of a harbor could end in anything else but the permanent destruction of that harbor; and it was on that ground, as far as he could understand, that the measure was originally put forward and afterwards justified. The permanent destruction of a harbor was not justified by the laws of war. [Hear, hear.] War undoubtedly sanctioned many grievous acts, but it did not sanction any act of this kind. [Hear.] The permanent destruction of a harbor was not an act of war of man against man, or of nation against nation, but it was an act of war against the bounty of Providence, which had vouchsafed harbors for the advantage of commerce and for the civilizing influences of intercourse between one people and another. [Hear, hear.] On this ground we were well entitled and were bound to enter a protest against such acts. [Hear, hear.] He wished to hear from the noble Earl whether these reports were well founded, and, if so, whether he had taken or designed to take any steps in the matter.

"The Report of the Commissioners of Charities and Correction for last year has been presented to the Legislature. It is a document of interest and importance to every tax-payer, philanthropist and citizen. The public institutions in charge of the Commissioners are intended to furnish relief to almost every kind and form of suffering and want that exists in this great City; and the taxes levied for their support are intended to supersede, in ordinary cases, the necessity for private charity. It is well, on behalf of the poor, that a Board composed of such men as this is, is in continual session, and ever ready to relieve their wants; and it is well on behalf of the community which sustains these charities, that such men can be retained for their honest and economical management. The work of the Commissioners extends over a large ground, and in every Department there are evidences of the most judicious management. It gives but little idea of the variety and complexity of the duties devolving upon them to maintain the Departments with which their labor is divided, and the institutions under their charge -- the relief of the ""out-door poor,"" the care of the great hospitals, Bellevue, Small-pox, Ward's Island and Blackwell's Island, the management of the Alms-house, the Work-house, the Lunatic Asylum, the Colored Home, and Colored Orphan Asylum, the City Prison, Penitentiary, etc. To those who do not personally inspect the practical working of these social charities and corrective institutions, no conception can be had of the amount of suffering relieved, of the burdens which are taken from the shoulders of the individual citizen, or of the labor devolving upon their managers. The condition of the buildings is in every case admirable; the provision for the inmates is as near complete as is possible with an economical expenditure; the medical attention to the sick is as perfect as the science of medicine can suggest; lunatics, vagrants and criminals are put under moral discipline that has been attended with the happiest results; and the children of the street have, as far as they are within the purview of the Commissioners, been trained to order, industry, intelligence and virtue. All this has been done with a careful economy with which not the most thrifty can complain. Though the amount of relief afforded was far greater than under the mixed Commission, which existed up to 1859, yet the expenditures of last year were less than those of 1859 by nearly a hundred thousand dollars. In fact, looking from any direction at the year's work of theCommission of Public Charities and Correction, and even the most rigid critic can award little but praise. The citizens of New-York owe much to the gentlemen composing it; and it is pleasant, after examining both the report and the work represented by it, to express the conviction that, in no city in the world are the public charities better managed than in this Metropolis.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/05/archives/relief-of-poverty-in-newyork.html,,"The Report of the Commissioners of Charities and Correction for last year has been presented to the Legislature.

"The latest cartoon of Punch represents that dignitary in the cap, gown, and spectacles of a pedagogue, smiling approval at little Earl RUSSELL, who, sustained by little Lord PALMERSTON, struggles forward with a monstrous blue book labeled ""Papers on American Affairs."" American affairs are in reality the multiform topic of John Bull. He writes and reads of them in his newspapers, talks of them over his wine, speaks of them on the hustings, preaches about them from his pulpit. They enter into his workshops, empty his ships, disturb his balances at bank, threaten starvation to his laborers. There is no place where the discussion ends; there is no interest so unaffected as to turn from it with indifference. For the moment, American questions are the special and inevitable order of the day. In Parliament, the subject has the charm of novelty. Last session everybody was eager to speak, and everybody had to be silent. For this silence members are now disposed to indemnify themselves. A day scarcely passes without some of the many points disputable coming up for the consideration of both houses. In the Lords, the rights of British subjects, as affected by the war, have to be investigated, or the blockade challenged; and to every inquiry the Foreign Secretary has to be prepared with a response. The discussions of the Commons take a wider scope. On another page of this paper is reproduced a highly interesting passage at arms between Mr. JOHN BRIGHT and the Premier; the former, making the Canadian estimates his text, denouncing the war policy of the Cabinet, and eulogizing the conduct of the American Government and people. Mr. BRIGHT sees no failure in American institutions. He ridicules with capital effect the talk of a mob overawing the Executive, or of a Secretary of State precipitating the country into a war, and those other multitudinous errors and misconceptions into which Englishmen are incessantly betrayed in their allusions to transatlantic matters. He does full justice to the cause of the North, and brands with scorn the cowardice which selected the very crisis in the American case to make ferocious and insulting gesticulations at the American people. Lord PALMERSTON, with facile and plausible rhetoric replied, and, of course, contented with his rejoinder a House unaccustomed to sympathize with the reformer of Rochdale, and taught by national self-conceit to regard all things American as wrong when they depart from English models.

editorial on bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/05/archives/from-europe.html,editorial on bill,"By the arrival of the Norwegian at Portland, and the Arabia and Bremen at this port, we have advices from Europe five days later. The Norwe- gian left Liverpool on the 20th, and Londonderry on the 21st ult. The supplementary estimates for the naval and military expenditures in the Trent affair, amounting to 973,000, were moved in the House of Commons on the 17th, and unani- mously agreed to. In the debate on the subject, Mr. BRIGHT strongly denounced the policy of the Government. He said the money had been worse than thrown away. He refuted the idea that the American Government was influenced by a mob, and argued that the interests of England were so bound up with America, that it was in every respect inadvisable to inflict a sting that it would take centuries to remove. Lord PALMERSTON defended the Ministers, and said that Mr. BRIGHT's opinions were confined to himself; he contended that there was every reason to justify England in backing up her demand in the manner she did, as the course of the American Government clearly showed that they did not, at the earlier stage of the affair, regard the act as one they ought to disavow. He thought the course taken deserved commendation, and believed it was calculated to insure the continuance of peace. In the House of Lords, on the 18th, the Earl of Carnarvon called attention to the imprisonment of Mr. SHAVER, a British subject, in Fort Warren, and said it was a clear case of compensation. Earl RUSSELL said Mr. SHAVER had not claimed compensation, and it was not for the Government to do it for him; neither had he rebutted the charges against him. Earl RUSSELL deeply regretted the civil war in America, and expressed the hope that England would treat with forbearance any stretch of power not intended to injure British interests, nor to insult the British flag.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6f5f764-96f1-52a5-a545-f1b5635c991f,491,nyt://article/f6f5f764-96f1-52a5-a545-f1b5635c991f,

"The appointment by the President of ANDREW JOHNSON as Military Governor of Tennessee is in the exercise of a right incidental to the declaration of martial law.

For, while the State or its Government are not and cannot be abolished, neither can the existence of the traitors who have seized the helm of administration be in any way recognized. So that, on taking military possession of the territory of this or any other rebel State, and until such time as political reorganization is accomplished, there can be no local Government there but such as the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the army, shall provide. In Tennessee, and, probably, in nearly all the revolted States, the period for the existence of this anomalous system will be brief. The people have the privilege of at once resuming all their ancient and Constitutional rights; and, when once the military power of the rebel Government is demolished, we have reason to believe, from their education, training and character, that they will not be slow to resume the franchises to which, as citizens, they have always been accustomed. In Tennessee, indeed, the loyal people are ready at once to enter upon the work of State reorganization. For the time being they succumbed to rebel authority which they were unable to overthrow; but, with National protection and aid, they will, according to the forms prescribed in the Constitution, speedily bring themselves and the State again in friendly relation with the General Government.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Government for Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Government for Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Tennessee', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Johnson, Andrew', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d7b6cc8-3bef-5ca1-9150-febfefd6a05d,637,nyt://article/2d7b6cc8-3bef-5ca1-9150-febfefd6a05d,

The account of the affair that comes from Norfolk states that the Nashville approached the blockading vessel off Beaufort, with the Union flag flying, went directly up under her guns, almost within hailing distance, and then, passing her, raised the rebel flag, and moved directly toward Fort Macon. It was quite in character that the Captain of a vessel stolen from loyal owners at the outbreak of the rebellion, should for the nonce steal the flag to which he has turned traitor, as men are said to steal the purple plush of Heaven to serve the Devil in; but this furnishes no excuse for the culpable carelessness of the naval officer on duty, who allowed himself to be deceived by this poor ruse. If the facts are as stated in the present report, we can hardly see how the Navy Department can avoid cashiering that officer, whoever he may be.

Mr. LINCOLN appreciates the infinite difficulty of the Slavery question. He evidently despairs of prostrating the institution by force of the war-power; he looks to its existence in full vigor, throughout the Gulf States at least, when the war shall have ended. The utmost reach of his practical dealing with the subject is to strip it of political influence in National affairs. To effect this capital object, there is certainly no way so sure as to destroy the identity of interest between Border Slave States and those at the southward; and this object the President's suggestion proposes to attain. It takes the form of a joint resolution submitted to the consideration of Congress. The possibility of one or more States discovering the impolicy of retaining slave-labor is assumed. To such the joint resolution offers pecuniary aid in the task of emancipation, by engaging to pay a sum prefixed for each enslaved negro set at liberty. This bounty the President evidently believes will turn the scale in favor of freedom. Satisfied of the good faith of the National Government in its professions of non-intervention in the legislation of the States, the States will be ready to look favorably upon a plan which, while it makes the merit of the act of emancipation their own, throws the cost elsewhere. And as the plan is adopted, one after another of the northerly Slave States will array themselves on the side of the free communities of the North.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The President on Emancipation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The President on Emancipation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/000c9125-7b58-5bf6-9c37-c678b4d2da42,711,nyt://article/000c9125-7b58-5bf6-9c37-c678b4d2da42,

"The intelligence from Mexico is interesting. According to the Vera Cruz correspondents of the two leading Cuban journals, there is a probability of peace being concluded between the Juarez Government and the invaders. On the 19th ultimo, the CONDE DE REUSS, Spain's representative, had an interview with Gen. DOBLADO, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the village of Soledad, and preliminaries were agreed on, which the Plenipotentiaries of England and France subsequently approved. The exact nature of the terms assented to was unknown when our authorities wrote, but the principal results of the conference were said to be that negotiations were to be opened at Orizaba for the settlement of differences; and that the allied troops were to occupy Orizaba, Cordova and Tehuacan, while the diplomats were at work, provided they were content to go back to their sickly quarters on the coast, should no pacific solution be attained. Such is the pith of our latest information from Mexico. Whether it reveals aught which would justify the sanguine anticipations of the Vera Cruz correspondents aforesaid, is somewhat questionable. Indeed it would be rather rash to assume that the interventionists have entered into these negotiations with honest intents. True, the Eco de Europa, the organ of the Allies in Mexico, asserts that the conduct of its patrons out there has been not merely honest, but actually magnanimous, ""When the world knows,"" says this adulator, ""the efforts which the Allies have used to give peace to Mexico, it will be filled with astonishment; when the Republic, which does not yet know it, knows it, it will be filled with astonishment and gratitude! Creditors pacifying the debtor; the strong begging of the weak; men of war making sacrifices for peace; armed Europe asking of a State, as it were unarmed, to consent to be happy through its counsel and its influence; these things were never before seen!"" In a word, if we are to interpret the rhetoric of the Eco literally, the Powers which have combined against Mexico, are the most disinterested and philanthropic of nations. No selfish considerations, no ambitious yearnings, no hostile designs urged them to the enterprise, but feelings of sympathy, amity, and benevolence toward the Republic! The object of the expedition, the expedition itself, the seizure of Vera Cruz and its fortress, and every thought and act of the Allies, from first to last, savored of magnanimity! Yet how much more disinterested, how much more philanthropic, how much more magnanimous, would their conduct have been, had they practiced forbearance toward Mexico, not undertaken the expedition, and never thought or acted at all in the matter. In despite, then, of the Eco's panegyric, we maintain that the tortuous policy which the coalition has been pursuing in relation to Mexico, renders its honesty open to suspicion. To be negotiating for a compromise of differences with the JUAREZ Government, and, at the same time, to be plotting in Europe for the overthrow of that Government, and the establishment of a monarchy on its ruins, does certainly seem extremely like perfidy. This simultaneous diplomacy on the part of interventionists for purposes the most opposite, cannot surely be sterling in both cases. Either they must design to humbug the Mexican President, to amuse, until prepared to crush him; or they must not really mean to confer on the Austrian Archduke, the crown which they have offered him. They cannot possibly be acting in sincerity and good faith with the two personages, and as they can have no conceivable motive for trifling with MAXIMILIAN, it can be no great breach of charity to conclude that the Republican Magistrate is the victim.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/07/archives/the-mexican-imbroglio.html,,"The intelligence from Mexico is interesting.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/07/archives/jeffs-maine-law.html,,"-- By an odd coincidence the journals of all cities of the South from Richmond to New-Orleans, have of late commenced a very lively crusade against whisky. It is really instructive to observe the dead earnestness with which these converts to the doctrine of Father MATHEW iterate the old stock arguments for teetotalism. And from their own showing there is a call for dead earnestness; for the picture they draw of drunkenness at the South, and especially in the Southern armies, is of the most intense and horrible kind. The holy JEFF. was indeed able to report in his late message that ""a tone of earnest piety has pervaded our people;"" but he might have added that it was accompanied by a tone of still more earnest potation. It appears that the presence of the rebel army in Virginia has caused no less than two hundred new distilleries to spring up in the State within the past six months. A Richmond journal says that in that city ""drunken men reel out, tumble into the gutters, sprawl over the sidewalks, brandish knives and pistols, and oftentimes indulge in those deadly conflicts which fill our prisons with candidates for the gallows."" And it was one of the most curious developments we have yet had that when the Union army entered Nashville the other day, their advent was hailed by Mayor CHEATHAM solely on the ground that it would give him power to put an end to the wholesale intoxication that was playing the devil with the city?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""JEFF'S MAINE LAW."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""JEFF'S MAINE LAW."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ce34d7e2-eb04-561e-8f9b-c42e7dc41f55,471,nyt://article/ce34d7e2-eb04-561e-8f9b-c42e7dc41f55,

BOTTS has been arrested on his Virginia farm, and placed in a Virginia prison, FAULKNER has been released from his Boston prison, and has been visiting his Virginia farm. Both gentlemen have been Union men, with a difference. The Unionism of BOTTS has been of a sturdy, consistent type, keeping the unalterable tenor of its way through all the vicissitudes of party, denouncing on the one hand the extravagances of Abolitionism, and, with even more eloquence and fervor, denouncing the even more dangerous heresy of secession. He was in fact a Henry Clay Whig who survived himself. No allurements of the Jeff. Davis school have availed to draw him from his retirement into the active support of the rebellion. No terrorism has compelled him to revoke one loyal principle. His last audible word was for the Union.

Observations from Great Britain,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/08/archives/england-and-the-united-states-remarks-of-hon-royal-phelps-in-the.html,Observations from Great Britain,"In the Assembly on the 1st inst., when the bill to provide for the Public Defence was taken up in Committee of the whole, Mr. PHELPS, of New-York, said he did not intend to enter into any lengthened debate upon this question, which had already been very fully discussed, and on which many members of that body yet desired to be heard. But he wished to say a few words on one or two points which either had not been touched on at all, or on which he felt himself compelled to differ with those who had so ably argued on both sides of the question. He desired first to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government of the United States has already, through the action of our representatives in Congress, appropriated a large amount of money for the very purposes to which the sums set apart in this bill were to be devoted. He had on another occasion, a few days since, alluded to the action of the Government in this direction, and he was somewhat surprised that no reference had been made to this important fact in the elaborate and extended argument of the able Chairman of the Military Committee, (Mr. PIERCE.) But while the appropriations thus made for the public defence had been ignored in debate, much stress had been placed on the letter of our energetic Secretary of State, (Mr. SEWARD,) addressed to the Governors of the several loyal States, inviting State cooperation with the Federal Government, in putting our coast and borders into a proper condition for defence against an invading army. That member of the Cabinet deservedly enjoys the confidence and respect of the Legislature of New-York, and the policy he recommended in his letter, was doubtless, under existing circumstances, wise and patriotic. But it must be remembered that the appropriation by the Federal Government has been made since the letter of Mr. SEWARD was written, and, therefore, not alone from the altered condition of our foreign relations, but from the fact that the moneys then needed have been supplied since by the general Government, does the policy, prudent and necessary at that time, become of questionable propriety now.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES.; Remarks of Hon.

It is the first instance in which Government has declared that its influence shall be exerted in favor of freedom, and that we should use the public revenues in weakening the political and military strength of one section, and elevating that of the other. The opinions of Mr. LINCOLN are in harmony with the fathers of the Government -- WASHINGTON, JEFERSON, MADISON, and their illustrious compeers. They earnestly desired to see Slavery extinguished, and believed it must gradually disappear under the influence of those benign principles they embodied in the Constitution, as a chart to be observed in spirit as well as in letter. But the result did not justify their expectations. Although Slavery was for a generation everywhere admitted to be an evil, the owners of the chattels had not sufficient force or moral sense to carry their convictions into practice. As it is not in nature for men to live forever in admitted wrong, the only alternative left was the ground finally assumed at the South, that Slavery in itself is good, instead of being bad; that it has God's blessing, instead of His curse. The logic to such a conclusion was irresistible. ""All institutions,"" said the slaveholders, ""Are the concretes of public opinion. If the opinion of the country be against Slavery, such opinion will, at some day, distant it may be, express itself in action, by virtue of which Slavery must disappear. But Slavery is right. The opinion against it is a prejudice, which can and must be made to give way to truth. Our task is to educate the North to a proper estimate of the institution. Through the North we must regenerate the world, and in this way place ourselves rectus in curia in the moral as well as in the political forum of mankind.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Recent Message of the President.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Recent Message of the President.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/47d80ede-2943-53db-9377-041fab073d9c,1181,nyt://article/47d80ede-2943-53db-9377-041fab073d9c,

editorial on Lincoln views on emancipation; editorial on financial aspects of emancipation,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/08/archives/financial-aspect-of-emancipation.html,editorial on Lincoln views on emancipation; editorial on financial aspects of emancipation,"The President, in his important special message on gradual emancipation in the Border Slave States, has not pointed out the mode or means of pecuniary aid in the good work. But there is no mistaking his main purpose. He would make it the pecuniary interest of these States, as well as their interest in a domestic-economical sense, to take the initiative of gradual emancipation. He would have them invite and introduce free white labor, where slave labor has become, or threatens soon to become, unprofitable. If white labor, now comparatively inert, but in sufficient numerical force, is already in their borders, he would stimulate it to activity, by gradually removing the competition of slave labor, or by rendering it secondary in the mechanic and manufacturing pursuits, if not in agriculture itself, to free skill and industry. This change needs encouragement. It requires pecuniary relief from the taxation entailed upon the State under the old system. Virginia and Missouri, as examples, are burdened with a heavy, not to say overwhelming, public indebtedness, from which they neither hope or seek to escape. Virginia has engaged to pay $2,400,000 by annual interest, and as much more yearly by way of sinking fund on the great debt of forty millions. To attempt the industrial change suggested by the President, and to invite white labor into her rich valleys, and to the employment of her unemployed water-power, with this heavy charge of local taxation upon her State finances, and at the same time pay her equal quota of National taxation, would be to delay, if not to defeat, the desired object. It is here that the pecuniary aid of the General Government might appropriately come in, and with as little detriment to the lender as the borrower. The equivalent of an act for the gradual emancipation of Slavery, by declaring that all negroes born after a given period shall be free on attaining the age of 21 or 28 years, the interest upon the Public Debt of the Commonwealth would be assumed to be paid by the United States, less the ordinary revenues derived from the public works and bank stocks originally created by or with the proceeds of this debt. The equivalent would come back to the United States in a few years in the increased ability of the people to pay their quota of the National taxation; this ability being measured by the enhanced value of personal and real property under the free-labor system. If need be, the United States might assume at once, if not at 6 per cent., say at 4 or 5 per cent., the entire indebtedness, principal and interest, incurred by the Commonwealth for legitimate and loyal objects before this rebellion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Financial Aspect of Emancipation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Financial Aspect of Emancipation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/757e37bb-9a29-5207-8949-e630b66e3209,1122,nyt://article/757e37bb-9a29-5207-8949-e630b66e3209,

Being simply a civilian, without even these trifling pretensions to military skill and experience which are claimed by his colleagues, the presumptions are strongly against his selection for the command of the Confederate forces at a critical moment like this; and much stronger against the plan of operations marked out for him. True, the rebels are weary of their military idols. SYDNEY JOHNSTON is loudly abused as a failure; FLOYD and PILLOW as cowards; POLK is a granny; BUCKNER a humbug. It has been observed that the presence of BEAUREGARD in the West seemed to be the beginning of ill-fortune. HUGER, commanding the all-important post of Norfolk, is the butt of the coarsest vituperation in the Petersburgh and Raleigh papers. WISE has laid down his epaulets. The entire generation of Generals is under the clouds, insomuch that the Confederate Congress has been considering, with favor, the plan of placing the military reins in a single hand, invested with absolute and plenary powers.

"-- The telegraph is now in operation to Nashville, but the first news of the movements of our army in the West still continues to reach us by way of the far South. From this direction comes the intelligence that our forces have advanced from Nashville southward to Murfreesboro, and have occupied that point, while the rebels under SIDNEY JOHNSTON have retreated into Alabama. Whether the statements are true or not, we will not be likely to know assuredly until we hear direct from our own correspondents in Tennessee. But, until then, there is no special reason to doubt the truth of either of the rebel reports. It is altogether likely that it was the purpose of Gen. BUELL not to tarry long at Nashville with his main body, but to advance rapidly as far South as Chattanooga, on the Upper Tennessee River. This is the fundamental strategic position in Tennessee, and hardly less important as related to the adjoining States. It not only gives control of the entire vast line of the Tennessee River, but brings us into intimate relations with Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Alabama. It gives us possession of the railroad connecting all the lines in Tennessee and the Gulf States with the rebel States of the East; and is thus the key to the whole Southern system of railroads. For natural strength it is a position unsurpassed, located as it is just where the river breaks through the Cumberland Mountains. It has heretofore been reported that the rebels were retreating to this point to make a ""stand;"" but it would be as difficult to hold, and of as little value to them, as it is easily held and of great value to us. If the other part of the rebel report be true, that JOHNSTON has moved his forces to Decatur, Ala., it is probable that he only went down the Chattanooga road to Stevenson, and thence has taken the railroad west to Memphis. This view is supported by a statement in a letter from a reliable resident of Nashville, (published elsewhere,) who avers that Gen. JOHNSTON, before leaving that town, said he would not make a ""stand"" until he got west of the Tennessee River. So that, taking into account all the facts and probabilities in the case, there is no reason to discredit the rebel report that JOHNSTON has evacuated Murfreesboro, and that our troops have gone forward and taken possession.

"-- A highly injurious impression has been communicated to the public in regard to Gen. STEVENS, the able and active commander of a brigade of our army in South Carolina. He is represented as cherishing secret sympathy with the rebellion; as reluctant to deprive even rebel owners of their slaves; and as treating, not with indifference, but with brutal cruelty, the negroes, who have been left on his hands by runaway masters. These charges were formulated in a letter published in the Tribune a few weeks ago. A correspondent, whose letter appears in another column, and whose reliability we vouch for in the largest sense, replies to these accusations, and, we think, abundantly and thoroughly explodes them. Gen. STEVENS had the misfortune to be, when in civil life, a Democrat of what was absurdly called the ""National"" Party.

Capt. JACOB BUSH, of the schooner John J. Houseman, drew from the Manattan Bank the sum of $250, in specie, and deposited it in a woolen mitten in a pocket of his overcoat. He took an Eighth-avenue car at the Astor House for the purpose of going to his vessel, then lying at the foot of Spring-street, North River, when the car arrived at the corner of Canal and Hudson streets, Capt. BUSH put his hand in his pocket to get money to pay his fare, when to his astonishment he discovered that his money was gone. He at once exclaimed to the conductor that he had been robbed on the car. At this moment a well-dressed and very respectable looking gentleman jumped from the car and ran swiftly along Hudson to Grand-street. Capt. BUSH, who is a man over 50 years of age, immediately pursued him, and by the aid of Officer FITZGERALD, of the Twenty-eighth Precinct, the culprit was caught and taken to the Station-house. When be found himself closely pursued, and a few moments previous to being caught, he threw the mitten containing the stolen money down an area in front of No. 19 1/2 Grand-street. A German, named ANDREW KIESSINGER, soon afterward found the money and conveyed it to the Twenty-eighth Precinct Station-house. On his way there, two of the confederates of the accused tried to persuade KEISSINGER to surrender the money to them for a consideration. Failing in this, they offered him a large sum to go away with the prize, and make no appearance at the Station-house. The honest German appeared at the Station-house, however, and delivered over to the Police Captain the stolen money. The accused, upon being taken before Justice QUACKERBUSH, at the Jefferson Market Police Court, gave his name as JOHN WILLIAMS. He is known to the Police as JOHN MULLIGAN. Justice QUACKENBUSH committed him, in default of $2,000 bail.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/684daaa0-d66e-5d6e-bee0-3c689910bbf3,705,nyt://article/684daaa0-d66e-5d6e-bee0-3c689910bbf3,

Editorial on Davis military strategy,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/09/archives/strategy-and-gasconade.html,Editorial on Davis military strategy,"It is an interesting study to note the difference at the present time in the South between the vaporing, gasconading followers and the clear-eyed military leader. The former talk loudly of all possible terrible means of war fare: of fearful and mysterious torpedoes, of mule-mounted cannon, of murderous machines; they propose to meet the iron-clad gunboats with heroic efforts at boarding; they are always just about to make some wonderful coup, such as the capture of Cairo or the invasion of Maryland. Then the desperate guerrilla warfare has glowing charms to their imagination; they are to follow the advancing hosts of the ruthless invader as the Spaniards followed the French; the deadly rifle is to decimate his companies at every cover or thicket; they will cut off his supplies, and then retreat to the mountains' and when at length they are driven to the last ditch, there, in gloomy and lonely desperation, they will die. Thus the aristocratic or popular organs of opinion at the South beguile the ardent imagination and supposed chivalric feeling of the armies. Whatever happens, they ""never, never will be conquered,"" -- ""Death, annihilation, before submission!"" The chivalric Virginians on Roanoke Island probably took a solemn oath on their revolvers, before the late battle, that, rather than submit, they would die to the last man, and then blow up the magazine. And it is not an incredible thing, that before the gleaming bayonets of the New-York regiments appeared in their front and flank, they really believed themselves that they would never yield.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Strategy and Gasconade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Strategy and Gasconade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af5ddca1-9d86-5eba-aedd-19ff7b3b7d01,1194,nyt://article/af5ddca1-9d86-5eba-aedd-19ff7b3b7d01,

A dispatch of M. THOUVENEL distinctly declares the project not to be of French origin at all. It sprang up, he intimates, in the desperate counsels of the Mexican reactionists themselves, who broached it first at Vienna, where they met no discouragement, and thence carried it to Paris. The correspondent of the London Times, writing from Paris, pronounces these statements deceptive. He asserts that the idea of enthroning MAXIMILIAN in Mexico is an old and favorite notion of NAPOLEON, who as far back as the summer of 1860, had sounded the Archduke and found him not unkindly disposed. Whether the balance of probability incline to the diplomatic or the newspaper correspondence, the reader is left to judge. We incline, however, to the view that, whenever the approval of MAXIMILIAN was obtained, it was procured by Mexican intrigues and without the direct interposition of the French Government. There is much reason to think the scheme had not recommended itself definitively to the mind of the Emperor, until after the triple treaty had been ratified.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Independence of the New World.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Independence of the New World.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fd8fd5f2-ed37-5051-83bf-3861ce00ade2,841,nyt://article/fd8fd5f2-ed37-5051-83bf-3861ce00ade2,

The rebel iron-clad steamer Merrimac, about which so much has been said recently, came down from Norfolk on Saturday morning, accompanied by the steamers Yorktown and Jamestown, also iron-clad, and moving directly toward Newport's News engaged the sailing frigates Cumberland and Congress, blockading the mouth of the James River. The Merrimac is represented to have resembled a submerged house, with the roof only above water. The two frigates opened fire upon her, but with no effect, as the heavy metal glanced from the slanting top of the Merrimac. Even at the distance of only one hundred yards, a full broadside from both vessels did her no damage. She ran against the Cumberland amidship, with a full head of steam on, staving a large hole in her side; then drew off and poured in a broadside, after which she dashed against the doomed vessel again, and left her in a sinking condition. She then turned against the Congress, and that vessel, having no regular crew on board, and seeing the hopelessness of further effort, lowered her colors, when she was boarded by the Jamestown, and all her officers were taken prisoners, while the few men on board were allowed to escape in boats. The Congress was then set on tire and left to her fate. The three rebel vessels then opened tire upon our batteries at Newport's News, which had been rendering what assistance was possible to the Cumberland and Congress, and the action continued for some time, when the Merrimac and her two companions drew off as far as Craney Island. The Minnesota, at the commencement of the action, in attempting to tow the Roanoke up' get ashore near the Rip Raps, and could render no assistance. It was supposed that the Merrimac would attempt to run the blockade on Saturday night, and preparations were made accordingly; but she appeals not to have made the effort. Meantime, on Saturday night the iron-clad Ericsson Battery Monitor, which left this port on Wednesday last, arrived at Fortress Monroe, and yesterday morning she was attacked by the Merrimac, Yorktown and Jamestown, but this time they met more than their match. After a five hours' contest, they were driven off, and the Merrimac retreated toward Norfolk in a sinking condition. The full particulars of this last action are yet wanting, but there is no doubt of the correctness of the report, as it is telegraphed officially from Washington, also from Fortress Monroe, by order of Gen. WOOL. The latter dispatch states that at times during the engagement the two iron-clad vessels were touching each other.

Upon the establishment of the Warehouse he was made Chief Clerk of the Division, having charge of it; which Division, by the present Collector, was put again fully in his charge. It is the most important in the Custom-house. It is not too much to say that no person in the Custom-house is more familiar with any branch of service, or more capable and efficient in their discharge. He has taken the above method of placing in the hands of the public, and of parties having business at the Custom-house, the routine of duty or office, entirely familiar to an habitue like himself, but often very complicated machinery to others. In doing this he has performed a most valuable service. The printed regulations of the Treasury Department, it is well known are very voluminous and loosely thrown together, with an index so meagre, and so badly prepared, as to render it about as difficult to find the desired information by any reference to it, as it is from the test itself. The work before us removes all those difficulties. It narrates, in a lucid and concise style, the whole routine of warehousing goods, with copious and judicious selections from the official regulations, giving the most explicit information in regard to bonded warehouses, appraisement of merchandise, damages, allowance, penalties, seizures, drawbacks, &c.; with full and accurate tables of foreign currencies, weights and measures; so that, although the design of the book is to treat principally of goods in bond, it will be found to be a most valuable guide to every branch of Custom-house business. It is a work that should not only be in the hands of every person engaged in commercial matters, but in every public library for general information and reference.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/10/archives/mr-lincolns-message-in-europe.html,,"The very natural and becoming deference which one nation pays to the opinions of others, renders the American people profoundly solicitous as to the reception which Mr. LINCOLN'S recent Message is to encounter in Europe. Here, where the almost exclusive devotion of the popular mind for fifty years to the single topic has taught, will some degree of clearness, the nature and bearings of the Slavery question, the suggestions of the President meet nothing but cordial approbation. The popular understanding in Europe is less thoroughly cultivated. The subject has been remote, and has been regarded rather with the languid interest with which we treat faraway objects, than with that acute insight which aids our inquiry into matters affecting the National life. American Slavery is in Europe an abstraction; here it is a practical question, the solution of which employs every faculty. While here we fully comprehend the relation of the National Government to the institutions of the individual State, it has been almost impossible to convey any notion of this relation to the transatlantic inquirer. If the National Government have a right to coerce the people of separate States into obedience to its central authority, why has it not power to alter and amend their domestic institutions, where humanity so imperiously demands their amendment? If the Central Government has no right to prescribe the abolition of Slavery, the right of the States to secede is incontrovertible, and the war it wages upon the South is fratricidal and oppressive. These propositions have formed the entire ground work of European reasoning on the American issue, and may possibly prevent, a just appreciation of the measure, which the President, mindful of constitutional order, has wisely recommended. It may be asked, will the American people content themselves with a mere palliative, where an absolute remedy is in their hands? Why not declare the slaves of the South free by proclamation? Or, if compensation be determined upon, why not make its acceptance compulsory, as it was under the British abolition act? And unless the answer which springs to the lips of every intelligent American, finds some to utter it in Europe, and make understood there the well-marked limit between National and local authority, clearly showing the former to be a creature of delegated powers, exactly defined, while the residue of power remains to the State, and how the National Legislature has no more authority to meddle with Slavery in a State than it has to meddle with a suttee in India, fault, it is very likely, will be found with the Presidential project, as a delusive and wholly ineffective measure. We certainly believe a less imperfect idea of our political system has been recently diffused in Europe. It is beginning to be understood that the Union is something different from a more confederation; that the cohesion of the States is not purely mechanical. The more kindly feeling with which our Government and its cause are regarded in England, France and Germany, is clearly due to the light which Messrs. MOTLEY, STORY, WEED, and others, have been at pains to throw upon a subject which rebel emissaries had thoroughly muddled. The true theory of our Constitution is no longer an insoluble enigma.

But it was absurd to suppose that, under any circumstances, she could have, been tempted to visit New-York. In the first place, it is very doubtful whether she could possibly stand the sea voyage. In the next, there is scarcely one chance in three that she could pass the forts that guard the entrance to the harbor. And in the third place, even if she could get in, it is not easy to see how she could possibly get out.

Naturally enough the exploits of the Merrimac excited some consternation, Her movements were bold and brilliant, and if she had met nothing more formidable than the ordinary wooden frigates of our navy, it is not easy to limit the amount of mischief she might have done. But it was absurd to suppose that, under any circumstances, she could have, been tempted to visit New-York. In the first place, it is very doubtful whether she could possibly stand the sea voyage. In the next, there is scarcely one chance in three that she could pass the forts that guard the entrance to the harbor. And in the third place, even if she could get in, it is not easy to see how she could possibly get out.

There must be 150,000 bales of cotton now lying in Florida, besides rice, sugar and tobacco in great quantity; and there is little danger of the planters in a thinly settled region of country like that, getting so hot in their political excitement as to set fire to their cotton. The fact that commodore DUPONT took down some forty vessels with him in his expedition, looks as if some of them were intended for other work than carrying shot and shell. Florida has but a small white population, and the plantations are mostly large and the planters rich.

If, indeed, the forces on the river have been withdrawn, the fact raises the strongest presumption that -- Manassas itself is to be instantly abandoned. The river batteries were never so much designed to obstruct the approach to Washington, as to secure another most essential point. This was to prevent the crossing of the National forces, already in great strength on the left bank, and accessible to unlimited reinforcements from the reserve at Washington. Had Gen. HOOKER, in the absence of opposing batteries, effected a landing in the rear of Gen. JOHNSTON, the movement would not only have exposed that commander to the risk of being surrounded and captured, but would have severed the most important line of rebel communication with Richmond -- that by way of Frederickshurgh.

Upon St. Simon's Island, which lies directly east of the mainland, the rebels had erected earthworks to guard the entrance into the ship-channel. These works were on the southern point of the island, and on Ickyl's Island opposite there were some minor defences.

After months of quiet preparation, which foreigners took for imbecility and accepted as the success of the rebellion, and at which our own people were at times disposed to murmur, a simultaneous movement has been made along a line measuring more than five thousand miles -- that upon land swarming with soldiers; that upon sea with ships -- a movement that is so irresistible in its force as to be often unopposed, because resistance is hopeless. Upon the banks of the Potomac in the East, Tennessee in the centre, and Arkansas in the far West, the march is onward, and the effective blow struck at almost the same instant -- an offensive movement, directed by a common purpose and to a common end, however different may have been the resistance offered or the means and method of attack. Upon the other frontier of the rebels -- the sea -- our ships are everywhere present, from the capes of Virginia to the capes of Florida, seizing their maritime strongholds and driving them back into the interior. The coils we have thrown around them are drawing closer and closer, till no alternative will be left but destruction or immediate submission.

They seem to have been laboring under the most intense panic, and a wild haste characterized their movements. Our troops found everything there in the wildest confusion. The works, however, were left entirely unharmed, with log huts capable of accommodating one hundred and fifty thousand men. The rebels also left behind them commissary and hospital stores in large quantities, besides wagons, tents, caissons, and other valuables. But the most remarkable announcement in regard to this remarkable flight, is that the division of rebel troops at Winchester, under command of Gen. JACKSON, has been left behind, and is consequently cut off and in imminent danger of capture. It was supposed at first that Winchester had also been evacuated, but dispatches received at headquarters yesterday state positively that JACKSON is still there. No better proof could be afforded of the haste with which the main army left Centreville and Manassas. Gordonsville is given as the point to which the rebels have retired. This is behind the Rappahannock River, and is in some respects a position equal to that at Manassas, though without the extensive fortifications of the latter place.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/645eaf45-63c9-5827-8c30-5faa428ef477,726,nyt://article/645eaf45-63c9-5827-8c30-5faa428ef477,

"At a time when we can reasonably look forward to a speedy supersedure of the blockade which for the past ten months the United States have established over the coast of the insurgent States, it is rather interesting to have assurance that the British Government considers it ""effective.""

If the ways of Cabinet Ministers were not past all understanding, we might just entertain a wish that Her Majesty's Foreign Secretary had seen his way to giving us the distinguished assurance any time during the past six months, when the air has been thick with ominous whispers of foreign intervention. Late as it is, however, the declaration which Earl RUSSELL makes in his dispatch to Lord LYONS, dated Feb. 15, is highly satisfactory and gratifying. It appears that all the representations of JEFF.'s London Commissioners -- YANCEY, ROST and MANN -- touching the inefficiency and consequent illegality of the blockade, have proved unavailing. Facts have spoken louder than secessionist figures, and the Cabinet has rightly put over against the formidable schedule of vessels that the rebels claim to have run the gauntlet of our coast squadron, the general scope of the blockade which -- the rebels themselves being witnesses -- has been terrible in its completeness. The language of Earl RUSSELL is noteworthy. He declares that the fact of ships having successfully run the blockade does not prevent it from being effective, and he argues that neutral States ought to exercise great caution with regard to a de facto blockade, and ought not to disregard it unless the power of the blockade should be abused.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Earl Russell on the Blockade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Earl Russell on the Blockade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/900f2dbb-df5b-5744-8c67-ab4df480ce86,586,nyt://article/900f2dbb-df5b-5744-8c67-ab4df480ce86,

Biographical sketch,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/12/archives/ben-mcculloch.html,Biographical sketch,"The career of Gen. BEN. MCCULLOCH, who is reported by Gen. CURTIS as having been killed at the battle of Pea Ridge, is so well known that it is hardly necessary to recapitulate now. But, if he be killed, this will be the last of him. As, however, since the war began, be has not only been ubiquitous in his presence, but has been slain several times, he may, perhaps, turn up again. He is a Tennesseean by birth, and 48 years of age. He first became famous in his native State, as a bear-killer. In 1835 he went to Texas with DAVY CROCKETT to take part in the Texan revolution, and SAM HOUSTON assigned him to the artillery and made him captain of a gun. He afterwards settled in Texas and became celebrated in Indian fights. When the Mexican war broke out he raised a band of Texans on the Guadaloupe, whose services were accepted by TAYLOR. He was employed in scouting expeditions and took a hand in various battles of the war; for which services President PIERCE afterward appointed him United States Marshal for Texas. When the Mormon rebellion broke out, he was appointed one of the Peace Commissioners to Utah, though a more unfit person could not have been discovered in the country. When the present rebellion broke out, he was sought for by JEFF. DAVIS, and has been engaged everywhere, and in all sorts of rebel service. He took a body of Texans to Missouri and assisted Gen. PRICE in various engagements, and particularly in the battle of Springfield. After that he quarreled with PRICE, and retired with his army to Arkansas, and stationed himself at Fort Smith. When Gen. CURTIS gave the present chase to the rebels, he again came north to the Arkansas northern line, with all the other rebel commanders in that section; and has now fallen, a traitor to his country. In person he was remarkable -- six feet high, slender but athletic, and with the appearance and air of a frontier fighter. He was undauntedly a partisan leader of capacity' but was utterly unfit to command a large body of men.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEN.

Miss MATILDA HERON made her rentree in a work from her own pen, called the ""Belle of the Season,"" and was received with warmth by the audience. The play is too emotional in its interest to reflect the peculiar characteristics of the society with which it is supposed to deal. The situations tread upon each other with an impetuosity which, whilst it displays the generous vehemence of the authoress, does not accord with the accepted rules of the drama. Miss HERON's individuality is very marked and peculiar. in her writing it is as marked as in her acting, but we enjoy it most in the latter. Hence, whilst her part in the play does not, by reason of her great ability as an actress, seem to be hurried, all the other parts are precipitate, and, in some instances, intrusive if not superfluous. These defects of construction cannot be remedied in a work so slimly supplied with a plot as the ""Belle of the Season."" To account for the success of the piece we must turn to the dialogue and here we find great wealth of womanly sentiment and considerable dexterity in dealing with delicate themes of the heart.

They started with the assumption of being a first-class Power; at the same time, in all that constitutes real strength, ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/13/archives/the-starving-out-of-the-rebellion.html,,"Never was there a truer remark than, that of Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS, in his Inaugural, that the rebels had undertaken more than they could carry out. They started with the assumption of being a first-class Power; at the same time, in all that constitutes real strength, they are, for their numbers, the weakest people in the world. Labor among them being held in dishonor, they are without commerce, consequently without wealth; without mechanical training or skill, consequently without manufactures; without industry, consequently without self-respect, or steadiness of purpose or character. With such poverty in all that constitutes strength, it is remarkable with what temerity they have provoked a conflict with a people possessing all the qualities that constitute true national greatness. But having had the control of the Government for more than a generation, and having been accustomed to have every command promptly obeyed by the obedient, facile and ingenious North, they had no idea but that their commands, wherever uttered, would be followed by similar promptitude in results. But on severing themselves from the North, they found themselves like Anteus, powerless when disjoined from the source of their strength. How could a half million of men be armed, at the South, without the means of fabricating a gun? The rebels, to be sure, displayed considerable foresight in smuggling into their territories nearly all the arms possessed by the United States previous to the rebellion; but even these proved of very little account, as the North has, within one short year, supplied itself anew with arms ten times more effective than those stolen, so rapid is the progress of science in fabricating weapons of destruction. On every field the odds are infinitely in our favor from this cause alone. We have still greater advantages in our means for feeding and clothing our soldiers and in rendering them comfortable and healthy. But behind all this we have the advantage of having an abundance of money, of which the South are almost entirely destitute. Compared with the North, they never had any in their best estate. When the rebellion broke out, consequently, they were of necessity forced to provide means by an issue of credits, which became a common medium of exchange, not only between the Government and the people, but between the people themselves. The value of such medium is measured entirely by the degree of confidence felt in the stability and means of the Government issuing them. During the first ebullitions of passion, under the confidence created at the early successes in seizing undefended forts, mints and Custom-houses, Confederate bonds served, to an extent, the purpose for which they were issued. With the provision in the Confederate Constitution, that any State may retire from the Government at will, only a little time for reflection was wanting to destroy all confidence in the value of these bonds. Their market price soon sunk to one-half their nominal value, even in exchange for the irredeemable currency of the South But the success of the Union cause -- which has now destroyed all hope of Southern independence -- has put the finishing touch to them. They are to-day, in South Carolina, we have no doubt, regarded as worthless as are the preserved relics of the old Continental currency. Correspondents tell us that Confederate scrip is universally regarded with loathing, even by the rebels, not only from its utter worthlessness, but from the infinite losses already suffered from it. The amount issued measures the extent of these losses. Nearly all that the South could produce, or part with, during the year, is represented by it. But the end is not yet. A mere fiction, of which the evidence upon which it is written will soon disappear, has been made the basis of innumerable contracts, which will all be declared invalid under the laws of the United States, involving the property in the South in such interminable confusion that nothing but a bankrupt law, of which the greater portion of the people must take the benefit, can restore certainty and order.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Starving Out of the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Starving Out of the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abdddb14-1bce-5bd3-858e-40286de89e28,920,nyt://article/abdddb14-1bce-5bd3-858e-40286de89e28,

We now learn that he has suspended Messrs. FLOYD (the thief) and PILLOW from their commands until they could give more satisfactory accounts of the affair. This is certainly hard on FLOYD, who is called by the Richmond Examiner ""the hero of thirty battles,"" to be suspended at a moment when there is such a brilliant opportunity for him to achieve further and greater glories in the field. It is no less severe upon PILLOW, who is so much needed at present for the defence of his beloved but beleaguered city of Memphis. Surely JEFF. DAVIS could not have carefully perused Gen. PILLOW's report of the battle of Donelson, which so clearly stated the reason for his own and FLOYD's want of success on that memorable occasion. PILLOW showed that the Union forces met him in a manner which he had not contemplated, and for which he was entirely unprepared; and whereas, he had provided for ""rolling back our forces, cutting them up, and putting them to rout,"" he found, as he says, that they ""would not retreat, but fought us and contested every inch of ground."" Surely that ought to be a satisfactory explanation to the rebel President of FLOYD's and PILLOW's failure to secure a victory. As for JEFF. DAVIS's other charges, PILLOW had previously refuted them all.

After several days' scouting, and with his command reduced to a sergeant and twelve men, on Sunday, the 9th, he fell in with the pickets of the enemy, a score in number, and drove them in, till finally he was suddenly surrounded by a hundred and fifty of the enemy. The alternative was to cut his way out, or to surrender at discretion. ""Will you follow me?"" said the unshrinking officer. ""To the death!"" was the unanimous reply; and through the rebel ranks they hewed their way, turning not to right or left, till they emerged from the forest at Sangster's Station, the enemy either fleeing or laying down their arms before them. After this daring action, and while making their way to the camp, with thirteen prisoners, one to each man, when one of the skulking assassins, who had laid down his arms, seized his musket and shot the retiring officer dead upon the spot. The ball entered the back, near the top of the shoulder, and passed out through the neck under the chin, severing numerous blood-vessels, whose profuse bleeding soon closed the career of one of the most promising men in the army.

Perhaps I can best accomplish this, the purpose before me, by going back to the period when the balls first flew at Sumter -- an unnatural and shameful insult to the Stars and Stripes, and which, although a Britisher, I felt as keenly as any genuine Knickerbocker, and fully participated in the burst of indignation which the circumstance occasioned. Indeed, but for the domestic ties which in my case could not be disregarded I would have shouldered arms and been ""off to the ball wi' the lave."" As it was, I denounced the crime thus inaugurated not only against the Government of the United States, but against the whole civilized world.

Observations from Great Britain,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/15/archives/financial-aspects-of-the-war-the-bankruptcy-of-america-why-america.html,Observations from Great Britain,"It was worth a costly experiment to retain that rich Southern business, and New-York will be hard put to it either to win it back or to do without it. But the capitalists have now come to the conclusion that the game is on, and that the experiment is passing out of their hands. The suggestion to raise $150,000,000 yearly by direct taxation does not deceive them. They know very well that, even if the sovereign people would submit to endure a taxation as heavy as that of England, America could not continously raise more than £10,000,000 sterling annually. The rough calculation has always been that in capacity of taxation the proportion between the two countries is, that American dollars are equal to English pounds sterling. If we raise £50,000,000, exclusive of our customs. America probably could. If she pleased, raise $50,000,000, or £10,000,000 sterling. Such a possible revenue, even if it were not based upon the wild improbability that the Western States will consent to pay any such taxes, would be a very poor security for half the debt which has already accrued. In this state of things the commercial adage, that ""the first loss is the best,"" comes into play, and the capitalists of New-York are now watching for the first opportunity when it may be safe to say openly, ""This war must be settled somehow.""",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR; THE BANKRUPTCY OF AMERICA WHY AMERICA IS NOT BANKRUPT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR; THE BANKRUPTCY OF AMERICA WHY AMERICA IS NOT BANKRUPT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times.From the London News', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6d94ed32-8bc3-551d-a3d5-07b287374dec,1107,nyt://article/6d94ed32-8bc3-551d-a3d5-07b287374dec,

On the 15th of may, Consul BUNOH, in a dispatch to Lord JOHN RUSSELL, announced the blockade of Charleston on the 14th of May. One British ship, however, had succeeded in effecting an entrance without being warned off, and, in consequence, procured an excellent freight. Even at this early season, however, MR. BUNCH admits that the presence of the Niagara had greatly alarmed the city; and, although little practical inconvenience was experienced; the business of the city being entirely over for the reason, yet it was apprehended that toward Autumn its pressure would be felt, when the importations for the Winter are made, and the new crop of cotton is in the market. ""The detriment,"" he adds, ""to British trade, both import and export, will be very considerable should the blockade be prolonged."" On the 28th May the Consul wrote that the port was still open, but that no British vessels were at Charleston. On the 7th of June he announced the arrival of the Minnesota off Charleston, and again on the 12th June stated that the blockade was inefficient. The inefficiency, according to Mr. BUNCH, continued up to the 25th of July, and on the 16th of August the inefficiency still existed. The master of the privateer Dixie entered Charleston on the 19th of July, and made affidavit that he could see no vessel of the United States. On the 20th of August Mr. BUNCH again reported that the ports of North and South Carolina were virtually open. On the 4th of September he reported a continued laxity of the blockade. Vessels continued to enter and leave Charleston. No blockade to the southward. Mr. BUNCH having by this time been superseded, there are no further reports from him. Consul MURE, on the 18th of June, reported that the blockade of the MISSISSIPPI was strictly enforced. On the 23d of July Commander HICKLEY, of the Gladiator, reported that the blockade of the southern coast of the United States was merely nominal. He made a similar report on the 19th of August. On the 30th of July Consul MURE again reported that the blockade of the Mississippi was strict. Capt. DUNLOP, of Her Majesty's ship Jason, reported, July 23, that the American blockading squadron consisted of eleven vessels. At Savannah the blockading ships were too large to act against small vessels, but, in order to make assurance double sure, the Confederates filled up one or more of the channels with stone vessels.

The exact nature of the difficulty is not stated; but the secret no doubt lies in what the lawyers might term a failure of consideration.

Editorial on construction of marine batteries; Editorial on construction of marine batteries,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/15/archives/marine-batteries-thick-armor-or-armor-in-sheets.html,Editorial on construction of marine batteries; Editorial on construction of marine batteries,"We understand that the Navy Department expresses a decided preference for thick plates of iron armor for ships in preference to several strata of thin plates of the same aggregate thickness. The European practice would seem to confirm this view of the case. But the most obvious facts and principles are all to the contrary. The elaborate experiments of Mr. STEVENS show that while the pile of thin plates may be more indented, the solid plate of equal thickness is most shattered and weakened by a ball of given force. The thin plates bend individually, and the inner plates are hardly weakened at all; but the whole of the thick plate must either give way altogether or be weakened in every part. Its fracture is irregular, and generally greatest on the back side; and the effect, as a whole, is more destructive. The same facts were fully illustrated in the late engagement -- the first engagement of two iron-clad vessels -- at Fortress Monroe. While the turret of the Monitor, composed of 8 layers, each an inch thick, was only indented 2 [???] inches by a shot striking square and flat upon it, one of the solid bars or plates, 9 inches thick and 12 inches deep, forming a part of her pilot-house, was completely broken in two by a similar shot, and opened [???] inch on the back side. Thus 8 inches of thin plates stood better than 9 inches of solid iron. This was due, in some degree, to the connection of the thin plates with the surrounding mass, while the solid plate had only its individual strength. And this leads to another view of the subject.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Marine Batteries Thick Armor or Armor in Sheets.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Marine Batteries Thick Armor or Armor in Sheets.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SHIPBUILDING', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8db4abf8-a809-591c-8f6b-8c9e86f7deaf,562,nyt://article/8db4abf8-a809-591c-8f6b-8c9e86f7deaf,

Editorial on Halleck command of Southwestern Military Depts,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/15/archives/the-work-of-gen-halleck.html,Editorial on Halleck command of Southwestern Military Depts,"Now that the three Southwestern Military Departments lately under BUELL, HALLECK and HUNTER, are consolidated into one great Department under Major-Gen. HALLECK, operations in that section will be carried on with a unity of purpose and an energy of spirit, the lack of which heretofore has produced delay and confusion. The desultory movements undertaken, and, under the circumstances, necessary, in Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, the Indian Territory and Arkansas, will now either entirely cease, or will be subordinated to the great purpose of expelling the armed rebels from the entire State of Tennessee, and from the States bordering on it southward to the Gulf of Mexico. Next to Eastern Virginia, this region is, both militarily and politically, the most important part of the rebel country. If the mountain lands of Northern Georgia and Northern Alabama are held by our troops, we will, with the foothold we already have in the mountains of Tennessee and Virginia, virtually have military control of all the vast slave region sloping southward from the Alleghanies. If the line of the Mississippi be in our hands, we likewise control the States bordering that great river on both sides to its mouth. In a political view, this region is no less important. The original school of secession conspirators looked almost entirely to the establishment of a great Slave Empire in the semi-tropical regions bordering upon the Gulf of Mexico. The Border States, to which we have thus far confined our military operations, were not expected nor desired to join the black oligarchic military Empire. They were looked upon rather in the light of outworks, to belong to the South, or to remain neutral, as they pleased, but really to be used as a barrier against the Abolition encroachments of the Northern States. At first extending from South Carolina to Florida, and sweeping from thence in a semicircle to the Rio Grande, the new Empire would speedily subjugate the feeble States of Mexico. Cuba and other West India Islands would be annexed, and all the negroes and peoples of other inferior races reduced to their normal condition of Slavery. The Gulf of Mexico would then form a central lake, round which would circle the States of the grand Confederation, whose corner-stone should be Slavery, and its rulers the lords of the plantation. This was the dream, fevered but gorgeous, of the conspirators who imagined they had fallen heir to the visions of AARON BURR -- such men as SLIDELL, JEFF. DAVIS, TOOMBS, RHETT and WIGFALL. The military possession of the States immediately south of Tennessee by our troops will at once and forever destroy all such hopes. Further, in the five or six States contiguous to the line of operation of which we are writing, the slave system of the South, to sustain which this rebellion was really and ostensibly inaugurated, has its greatest development. In the States bordering on the Gulf, and for some distance up the Mississippi, the population is divided into about one-half slave and the other half nominally free; while the slave element is massed in various districts, so as to give it there a prodigious predominance. This element is at once strength and weakness to the rebellion; but it is at our option to dispose of it in such a way as that it shall at least not add to the rebel power. Of this whole section of country, from our present lines of operation on the north to our line of operation on the southern Gulf coast, we give this morning a compact map; and in the brief space which it occupies will be seen the whole surface over which Gen. HALLECK has now to extend the National authority. As soon as that able Commander can march from his present position at Nashville, and take possession of Chattanooga in the east and Memphis in the west, and when in addition our forces on the coast take possession of Pensacola, Mobile and New-Orleans, the whole of the States of the Southwest and the Gulf will fall into our control. It would be utterly impossible to maintain a rebel army in the low, flat cotton-and-slave regions of central Alabama and Mississippi, while the national forces held possession of all the lines of communication, and stand invincible upon the front and rear. The rebels are now expelled from Missouri, the rebel army of Arkansas is routed, and, we believe that to-day here is not west of the Mississippi, five thousand effective rebels under arms. So that, to the work on the Gulf States and against the rebels there concentrated, Gen. HALLECK can bring the whole of the vast army lately in his own command, as well as the army lately in Kansas and Kentucky. It is probable that the National forces in Kentucky, added to that ready to begin operations on the Gulf, numbers not short of one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. The field for their conquest is a vast one; the work is difficult; but with such a force, united under and inspired by such a leader, we doubt not that the task will be done, and effectively done, sooner than most people anticipate. When done, it will end what at one time appeared the most difficult labor in putting down the great revolt. It will then remain only that the rebel army in Eastern Virginia be destroyed and South Carolina well chastised; after which the rebellion, as a military fact, will be essentially disposed of.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Work of Gen.

Some of the first militia regiments that marched from this City to save the Capital were largely composed of Germans. In the West, it is not too much to say that the German regiments, organized with such patriotic ardor in St. Louis and the vine districts of the southwestern counties, saved the State. Without the least hesitation or wavering they offered up themselves and their means in the cause of Freedom and the Republic. Many of their members were living in remote rural situations, surrounded by Secessionists; but regardless of all danger they pressed forward to fight for the good cause. Their houses were sacked and their pretty farms wasted, sometimes their families were murdered, but this did not deter these patriotic men. It must be remembered, also that these German regiments with which LYON, and SIGEL, and FREMONT made such rapid marches and dashing attacks, were by no means raw militia. Many of them had served in European wars; all had been thoroughly drilled in the National service at home. The well-known German regiment in Ohio -- the Ninth -- which decided, by a brilliant bayonet-charge, the battle of Mill Springs, and distinguished itself in so many skirmishes, was composed in part of old, experienced soldiers, who had seen service, and for the rest, of well-drilled Prussians.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The German Loyalists.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The German Loyalists.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2412d6eb-39b3-5d38-9f83-fab50b2a38e6,843,nyt://article/2412d6eb-39b3-5d38-9f83-fab50b2a38e6,

It has gone through a year of continued peril, not only to the National credit but to the Nation's existence, under trials upon the Treasury which might have staggered, if not overwhelmed more experienced statesmen. The ordeal to the Minister of Finance has no parallel in our Constitutional history; not even in the war of 1812-15. The burthen of public debt which that contest of three years with a foreign Power left upon the country, was only as three months expenditure in the present struggle against domestic rebellion. From a total of $45,209,000, the public debt then went up to $127,334,000 on final settlement of the war expenditure in 1816. We have now gone through only a single year of the existing war and such are the huge proportions of the army and the varied and costly nature of the naval and transport service engaged in it, that $300,000,000, or an average of nearly a million per day will barely suffice to foot the expenditure from the 6th of April, 1861, when the first order to reprovision Fort Sumter and reinforce Fort Pickens reached New-York, to the 4th of March, 1862. The prevailing impression, but certainly an erroneous, one tested by the actual figures, is, that for some months past, the average daily accumulation of debt is nearly or quite two millions per day. And whether this belief be erroneous or not, the Secretary of the Treasury has been compelled to encounter it in full force, in his periodical negotiations, and without disguising the real magnitude of his wants, to subject the National credit to at severity of trial accordingly.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Public Debt and National Credit.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Public Debt and National Credit.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/186ec498-0622-56a6-be9e-27ad196c0dc0,1228,nyt://article/186ec498-0622-56a6-be9e-27ad196c0dc0,

The concert at Niblo's Saloon to-night, and the Matinee to-morrow at Irving Hall, are the last entertainments at which Mr. GOTTSCHALK will appear previous to his departure for the West. The programmes are unusually interesting, almost every morceau this evening being fresh. On Wednesday the Academy of Music will once more open its portals VERDI's opera. ""Un Ballo en Maschera,"" will be played; in the last act the Masquerade scene is to be interpreted by professional terpsichoreans instead of muffs, and necessarily in a way quite new to the work. The beautiful [???] has been engaged by Mr. GRAU, and will appear in this opera, and as Fenella, the dumb girl, in ""Masaniello,"" which will be produced on Thursday evening. Mme. DE LUSSAN's debut will not take place until next week. We hear that Mr. GRAU has concluded not to give opera in Brooklyn. The pretensions and exactions of the Academy people render success there impossible. It is a melancholy fact, that only one or two performances have pain expenses since the theatre was erected. Mr. GRAU, who does all that he can for the public, consistently with something for himself, and who is amazingly fond of paying his artists and lessors in advance -- being in this respect quite phenomenal -- does not see the joke of paying a heavy rent for the privilege of losing money.

And naturally enough. The Slavery question has been so much before the people of late years that not only those who have made a specially of it, but every one at the North has had something to say upon it, and has come to recognize it as the greatest question of all which were devolved upon the American people to settle. And now when from the same quarter of the land whence in past years have arisen political controversies based upon this question, there has come up this tempest of rebellion, having the same source, it would be most extraordinary if we did not ask ourselves what was to be the effect of the war upon its cause; No one can tell this as yet, because it is not yet settled what steps are to be taken against Slavery in the prosecution of the war. If it is long enough and embittered enough by defeats on both sides, to lead our generals to declare the slaves free as a military measure, then, of course, the war will be the utter destruction of the system, bringing it to a sudden and violent end. And there are those who are impatient to have that course pursued, because they earnestly desire the overthrow of the systems and believe that such a sudden and violent destruction is the only way to reach the evil. And there are those, too, who argue, that we shall never establish a firmly cemented Union again, unless Slavery is first utterly overthrown.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Future of Slavery.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Future of Slavery.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7fc62a38-0795-5a89-b946-3508b7d28ba0,1128,nyt://article/7fc62a38-0795-5a89-b946-3508b7d28ba0,

By the prompt passage of this act the Government has been enabled to receive large amounts of duties on these [???].

"--After fighting every inch of ground, and at last yielding the merit claimed to the plans of Mr. STEVENS, the critics make a vigorous stand at a last objection -- the guns on the top of the armor, rather than within it.

Now, what are the facts? The shot-proof side of the Monitor's turret, several feet distant from the guns within it, protects those guns. Now suppose we place that shot-proof side six inches nearer the guns, does it not still protect them? Move the armor a foot nearer the guns, is the protection vitiated?

The ornaments were particularly unique, consisting of a statuette of St. Patrick, illuminated cathedral, the Harp of Ireland, towers and pyramids, and, best of all, a bird at the head of the table which OAKEY HALL said was emblematical of the pheasantry of Ireland.

"BLOCKADE OF THE RIO BRAVO. -- Through Havana comes the news that the mouth of the Rio Grande is vigilantly blockaded by the sloop-of-war Portsmouth. The right to close a river dividing our own from the Mexican Republic, may not be literally sustainable; but there is every reason to believe the exercise of a reasonable surveillance will not be objectionable to the Government of Mexico, or to that of any State preserving friendly relations with the United States.

"When Nashville had fallen, and thereby the rebel centre in Tennessee was pierced, there were but two or three other points of strategic value in that State for the rebels to defend. Of the first importance were Knoxville, in the eastern part of the State, and Memphis, in the extreme southwestern. The more immediately menaced of these points was Memphis, and to the defence of that place every rebel energy was turned, and every rebel soldier who could be spared was sent. There were but three approaches to Memphis immediately available for our advancing forces. One of these was by the Mississippi River from Cairo; another via the Memphis and Ohio Railroad, from the vicinity of Fort Henry; and the third, by our forces ascending the Tennessee River to the son them line of the State, from thence marching to Corinth, Miss., and there taking the railroad and approaching Memphis in the rear. The first of these routes, that by the Mississippi, the rebels, after being driven from Columbus, proceeded to defend by erecting earthworks at New-Madrid, which they mounted with a very large number of guns, and manned by a force eight thousand strong; they also fortified Island No. Ten, a short distance above the former point, stationed a strong body of troops there, and moreover, brought to its defence all the available rebel gunboats on the river, and an iron-clad floating battery; beside these, fortifications were erected at Randolph and other defensible points. To prevent our approach to Memphis from Fort Henry by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad, the rebels held possession of Humboldt on the line of that road, and of the town of Jackson, Madison County, twenty miles north of Humboldt, but on the line of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. The latter position is naturally a good one, and, if properly strengthened, would prevent all approaches to Memphis from the Northeast. BEAUREGARD himself assumed the task of fortifying Jackson, and, to make the work still more perfect, he took counsel of BRAGG, who came up from Pensacola to give it, and for other purposes. The other line of approach to Memphis, that by the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, running into the city from the southeast, the rebels guarded by fortifying Corinth, (Miss.,) and by stationing Gen. SIDNEY JOHNSTON's force at Decatur, (Ala.) -- the latter body to menace the rear of any National force which might ascend the Tennessee River, and from thence attempt to march upon Memphis. These various positions -- New-Madrid, Number Ten, Humboldt, Jackson and Corinth --formed a grand defensive semi-circle guarding Memphis, and, according to the rebels, blocked our approach in every direction, except by a long march through Arkansas.

It has been, until the rebellion, a point of considerable trade, exporting grain, lumber, turpentine, tar and naval stores. Besides the county buildings, it contains several churches, two banks, a small theatre, and three newspaper offices, and is a pleasantly-situated, handsomely-built and old-fashioned place. It is located near the inland water-way of the State, at the confluence of the Trent and Neuse rivers, on the western bank of the latter stream, some forty miles from the southern extremity of Pamlico Sound. Our maps will show the topography of the place, the point of landing of our troops, their line of march along the river, between the river and railroad, and other important points mentioned in this morning's telegrams. The Neuse is here about a mile and a half, and the Trent about half a mile wide. The former stream is [???] by steamboats for about eight months in the year. The entrance from the sea is through Ocracoke Inlet. Steamboats used to ply from Newbern, along the inland waters as far as Elizabeth City, (also recently captured by Gen. BURNSIDE,) and other points north of Roanoke Island. From Elizabeth City, again there was canal communication with Norfolk, and until BURNSIDE took Roanoke, this long line of navigation was in possession of the enemy. The rebels have been engaged in strengthening the defences of Newbern ever since it was bruited in the early part of the Winter that BURNSIDE's expedition was to operate upon the coast of North Carolina. A recent number of the Richmond [???] contain-ously remarked: ""Newbern is not without protection, but it is unnecessary to say what."" Probably the editor referred to the line of shore batteries (mentioned in the dispatches) to prevent a land attack, and the fire-ships to destroy an assailing fleet; but the event has proved that even these did not avail to keep back our brave legions. There is but one railroad running through Newbern -- that from Beaufort, (N.C.,) on the northeastern shore, to Goldsborough, in Wayne County, where it connects with the Weldon and Wilmington Road, and the whole system of shore railroads running South.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Locality of Gen.

On the morning of the 14th the march was again resumed, and our men had proceeded but a short distance when the rebels were discovered. Their works consisted of a series of strong batteries, extending over a distance of two miles, and defended by about ten thousand men, with twenty-one guns in position, besides a formidable array of field artillery. The batteries of the enemy were taken one after the other -- the last and most formidable one, where the rebels had concentrated their whole strength, by a gallant bayonet charge, in which the Massachusetts Twenty-first and the New-York Fifty-first again figured conspicuously. The enemy then fled pell-mell across the Trent River, destroying the bridges behind them, and having a sufficiency of cars at hand, made their escape in the direction of Goldsborough, leaving everything behind them, and about three hundred of their number as prisoners. They attempted to burn the town of Newbern before leaving it, but succeeded in doing very little damage, the citizens extinguishing the fires as fast as kindled. The Neuse River was obstructed by sunken vessels and chevaux-de-frise, which interfered with the operations of our gunboats, consequently the credit of the victory belongs in a great measure to the land forces. The rebels also had scows filled with tar and turpentine, at Newbern, to send down the river to burn our fleet, but the tide did not serve them as they desired, and the project failed. The battle was undoubtedly one of the most desperate of the war. Our troops behaved with the steadiness of veterans, and only won their victory after nearly four hours of close fighting. We captured three light batteries of field artillery, forty-six heavy siege guns, large stores of fixed ammunition, and three thousand stand of small arms, and among the prisoners are one Colonel, three Captains and four lieutenants. They left a number of dead on the field, but as they carried off a large part of their dead and wounded, their lose cannot be known. Our loss is from ninety to one hundred killed, and some four hundred wounded. The rebel force was commanded by Gen. LAWRENCE O'B.

The frowning ramparts of prejudice and old-fogyism, that have so long resisted the artillery of scientific progress, tumbled into ruin before the columbiads of official fear and popular clamor for improvement and protection. This is, perhaps, more strikingly evidenced in the total revolution of feeling with regard to the Stevens Battery than in any other fact of our history. As long ago as the War of 1812 the Messrs. STEVENS experimented on inclined armor for harbor defence, and consummated that grandest feature of cannon practice, the firing of shells horizontally. In 1841 they urged the Government, by documents which have ever since lain in the mouldy archives of the Department, to construct steam rams, iron plated vessels, driven by the submerged propeller, (invented by their father during the last century,) heavy guns, rifled cannon, elongated shot and shells covered with soft metal to prevent windage, and most of the other improvements which have begun to characterize and define the new era of naval warfare. For the last twenty-five years they have spent many thousands of dollars in experimenting upon the best means of carrying out those improvements, and in developing the great practical facts which the Government has adopted and will have to adopt, almost in detail, under the new regiare. They have advanced a quarter of a million toward the completion of the splendid vessel embodying these great features, a detailed and illustrated description of which will he found in other columns of this paper; they have actually built and worked many of the novel improvements -- such for instance as loading heavy guns by steam -- which men in authority laughed at until they were silenced by the results of actual trial; they have, until recently, concealed from the public the important results they have developed, at the sacrifice of all personal considerations, to oblige the Government; and they have not even demanded their due, when other men have reinvented and enjoyed the fruits of these very improvements. And what has been their reward? Opposition -- nothing but opposition -- public and private -- uncompromising and remorseless -- without precedent in the history of modern engineering progress. Their plans and memorials have been suffered to rot in the Government's vaults, while the information they have contained has been appropriated by other men, or kept from the light under bolts and bars. They have been encouraged to commence a ship of defence, of the most remarkable character and value, and to embark an immense fortune in it, merely to be abandoned and abused.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Iron-Clad Assault on Old-Fogyism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Iron-Clad Assault on Old-Fogyism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f391abe3-f76a-5d86-a753-09de7f6345b7,1106,nyt://article/f391abe3-f76a-5d86-a753-09de7f6345b7,

Hence, its achievements have had the effect of raising considerable mirth at its own expense.

Fort Marion. This finishes naval operations in Eastern Florida. North of St. Augustine we now hold the line of the St. John's River. Fernandina, and Cumberland Sound: and south of it there is not a harbor until the Florida. Keys are reached -- which again are in our hands. It was hardly worth while for the rebel Government to recommend the entire evacuation of East Florida, for already we control it all -- and virtually, indeed, the whole State -- and coast, rivers, and railroads.

Editorial says Tennessee is gradually returning to loyalty to Union,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/21/archives/the-counter-revolution-in-tennessee.html,Editorial says Tennessee is gradually returning to loyalty to Union,"The latest advices from Nashville and more favorable to the gradually returning sense of loyalty to the Old Flag. Gov. ANDREW JOHNSON had arrived at the seat of the Tennessee Government, and after addressing the people of Nashville from the steps of his hotel, in a most feeling and effective style, was conducted to the Capitol, where he took formal possession of the Government. The [???] of the address to the people is represented as one of the most extraordinary ever witnessed in the State. We can readily believe that if was so. The temporary separation of Tennessee from the Union was altogether a forced movement. There was no real heart in it, so far as the masses were consulted, if consulted at all. The political leaders, among the most desperate and unprincipled of whom was the Governor, ISHAM C. HARRIS, ""did up"" the whole business. They committed the people by a species of legislation before unknown to the Constitution of the State, and in direct contempt of the Constitution of the United States and once committed to what is called the Confederate cause, they were soon precipitated into armed rebellion against the Government. The consequence was that a large army was raised within the Middle and Western Districts of the State, to fight against the National flag. Even the sons of old Union men were impressed to fight for what was termed State sovereignty. Under such circumstances no great surprise ought to be felt that the return of popular sentiment in favor of the Government was slow. For the first week or two after Gen. [???] entered Nashville the signs of reaction were rather disheartening than otherwise. The people who had led the City after the fall of Fort Donelson were slow in returning. One-half the merchant stocks and shops of the city remained closed. The General Commanding, his Aids, and his army, were treated, for the most past, with sullen silence. They had to win their way to popular confidence, by slow degrees, and by the most scrupulous regard for the rights and immunities of private property, and the utmost deference to private prejudices.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Counter Revolution in Tennessee', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Counter Revolution in Tennessee', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a1433e5f-e778-5dfa-afd4-ec022e068fb1,575,nyt://article/a1433e5f-e778-5dfa-afd4-ec022e068fb1,

So long as there was the slightest reason to believe the revision and suppression of telegrams withheld important military information from the enemy, the Press was unanimous in its submission to the regulation as a salutary public measure. But it was presently apparent that all military intelligence embargoed by the telegraphic censor, could almost as early reach the newspaper office by mail; and that, after all, the discretion of using or withholding the news lay with the publisher. And while this discretion, which needed no abortive censorship of a person with the tithe of the intelligence and sound judgment of an average journalist to assist it, uniformly excluded improper army news, it has also become demonstrable that every military movement of importance has been communicated to the enemy. Even at this moment, there are sure indications, in the disposition of the rebel army, that the plans of Gen. MCCLELLAN, carefully concealed by the newspapers, are in the hands of the rebel leaders. As a military precaution, the telegraphic censorship is simply a failure and vexation.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A SENATORIAL CENSURE OF THE CENSORSHIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A SENATORIAL CENSURE OF THE CENSORSHIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8ab15200-8167-5a34-b628-d98057037646,513,nyt://article/8ab15200-8167-5a34-b628-d98057037646,

The news of the event, which we published yesterday, came from Cattletsburgh, a town situated at the confluence of the Big Sandy River with the Ohio, at the northeastern boundary line of Kentucky. The Big Sandy (its west fork) is the stream by which Gen. GARFIELD gets supplies up to the headquarters of his army at Piketon; and as steamboats run from Piketon to Catlletsburgh, it is likely that the latter would be the point from which we would get news of action anywhere on GARFIELD's line. The date of the encounter is not given, but it must have been as far back as last Monday or Tuesday. If the rebel force was five thousand strong, as stated, it was probably composed of the debris of HUMPHREY MARSHALL's old force, increased by such recruits as have been gathered to the rebel standard in the mountains during the Winter. Whether the obese HUMPHREY himself was in command, we were not told.

Lately its attention has been applied more particularly to the subject of City delivery, and in consequence there have been introduced many ameliorations, pefect possibly in theory, but which time and change of officers are needed to develop. The street boxes are recognized as a most valuable advance toward a better method, and where there was formerly but one collection of the deposited letters daily, there are now, when the duties of the carrier are fulfilled, five collections. Letters need not now be detained, as of old, from ten to thirty-four hours, at the Nassau-street office, but can be taken to the nearest station at once, and thence dispatched to their destination.

DAVIS' rebellion extend over a vast region of territory. The westernmost of his bloody outposts is among the far-distant, wild mountains of New-Mexico, on the upper waters of the Rio Grande. Of the fierce battle that was fought there on the 2lst ult., at the hamlet of Valyerde, we have already given the particulars. The rebels and savages undoubtedly repulsed our forces on that occasion; but it was after an exhibition of individual occasion; which has given us one of the most glorious names of the war -- that of the gallant North Carolinian soldier, Capt. ALEXANDER MCRAE -- a name worthy to take rank with the undying names of LYON, BAKER and LANDER. Our troops, however, still continue to hold Fort Craig, which is situated on the opposite side of the river from Valverde. The rebels, after their success, pushed northward and seized the town of Albuquerque, and, at latest advices, were marching upon Santa Fe, the Capital of New-Mexico, and Fort Union, the strongest fort in the Territory. In the meantime, the regiment of Union volunteers which were raised last Summer in Colorado Territory, have left their quarters near Denver, and marched southward to reinforce Fort Union, and give battle to the Texan rebels. The march is a terrible one, through the mountainous, uninhabited savage deserts of Northern New-Mexico; but the regiment is composed of men who know no such word as difficulty. News may be now looked for any day of a battle at Santa Fe or Fort Union, which will be decisive of the fate of New-Mexico and Arizona. We give herewith a clear and correct maps of the locality of the late and pending battles, for which we are indebted to the kindness of Major J.T. SPRAGUE, of the United States Army.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SEAT OF WAR IN THE FAR WEST.; Map Exhibiting the Locality of the Late Battle of Valverde, New-Mexico; Showing the Line of the Rio Grande, also Santa Fe, Fort Union, and the Other Positions now Menaced by the Rebels.

Editorial on large and small iron-clad ships; Editorial on large and small iron-clad ships,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/22/archives/large-and-small-ironclad-ships.html,Editorial on large and small iron-clad ships; Editorial on large and small iron-clad ships,"The first principle of military or naval success is concentration of force. The force of a war vessel is the weight of her broadside. Iron mail, that the blow of a ton would shiver, might stand the blow of 500 pounds for hours. This much will certainly be admitted on all hands. Now a vessel's broadside depends, of course, upon her size. A small gunboat can only carry two or three pieces, and throw 200 to 300 pounds at a broadside -- while a first-class frigate can carry forty guns, and throw half a ton. But the cost of a large vessel is objected to; and it is gravely asked why five gunboats, throwing 220 pounds each, are not just as good, and a great deal cheaper, than a vessel which, like the Minnesota, throws 1,100 pounds -- both classes to be iron-clad? Let the facts answer. The Monitor may throw 340 pounds at a broadside, (if Capt. DAHLGREN will consent to her guns firing solid shot, instead of hollow shot, as they did at the Merrimac,) and her cost was $275,000. The Stevens Battery will throw 2,200 pounds at a broadside, and cost $1,250,000. In other words, the cost of the Monitor per pound of broadside is $808, while that of the Stevens Battery per pound of broadside is $568, or 30 per cent. cheaper. But this only half states the case; for while the small vessel can concentrate but 340 pounds upon one point, the large vessel can concentrate a ton. Or, with reference to the money, the Government already has in the Stevens Battery her cost, for a given weight of broadside would be less than half -- only 40 per cent. -- of that of the small vessel. Again, the casemate guns and other expensive and unnecessary features of the British Warrior -- a vessel of the same size but of less speed and broadside than the Stevens Battery -- have raised the cost to an excessive amount; while the large sums expended by the Messrs. STEVENS on their vessel, and not charged to the Government -- expenditures on the dry-dock, preliminary experiments, &c. -- and the employment of water-protection, which costs nothing, have greatly reduced the cost of this vessel below a fair contract price. Hence the remarkable fact, that although the Warrior throws but 70 per cent. of the Stevens vessel's broadside, her cost per pound of broadside is nearly three times as great. These facts are before Congress, and we do not expect to hear any more objections to the Stevens Battery on the ground of her cost as due to her size.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Large and Small Iron-Clad Ships.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Large and Small Iron-Clad Ships.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ships and Shipping', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a95d4cf1-b716-5764-a04c-a9b3b52de74a,1022,nyt://article/a95d4cf1-b716-5764-a04c-a9b3b52de74a,

For the greater portion of the last thirty years that of the United States has been a libel upon free institutions, and the determined foe to progress either in ideas or in material greatness, that did not give to Slavery the same area and moral and political power as Freedom. The North was to take nothing by virtue of its educated people, its literary culture, its inventive genius, commerce or wealth. The dead body and the live one were always to retain the same measure, fullness and strength, lest the balance between the two sections should be inevitably overthrown. The inventive brain is now the prolific father of children and States. Population succeeds in exact ratio as the means of existence and comfort are supplied. Starting with an equal division of the population, the North left the South behind, just so soon as science and mechanical skill came to the aid of labor. Unable to compete in such a field, the South sought, by seizing the political power of Government, to hold in check, and finally to place in a subordinate position an enterprising rival, that was both hated and feared. This superiority of the North was met in the only manner it could be -- by a strict construction given to the organic law, the Constitution of the country -- which was interpreted so as to leave the Government really no function, except the conduct of its foreign relations, and the maintenance and advancement of Slavery. While the grand characteristic of the age is progress in ideas, in social organization, in unfolding natural laws, and in subjecting them to the service of man, the whole tendency of the Government has been a retrograde one, to be in harmony with the tendency of the South, which was toward an abject despotism. It came to be utterly unconstitutional for Government to exercise any function that would promote the commerce of the country, because any such step would benefit the North to a greater degree than the South. We could not have a railway to the Pacific, because Freedom would take the larger share of the advantage of such a work. We could not improve the navigation of a river, or render safe the harbor of a lake, no matter how vast its commerce, for the same reason. Restraint, not expansion, must be the law at Washington, and characterize as far as possible every attribute or function of Government, as the only means of preserving the balance of power between the two sections.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Some of the Advantages Secured Us by the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Some of the Advantages Secured Us by the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e5c94132-88d3-560c-a425-d6ba19082244,1002,nyt://article/e5c94132-88d3-560c-a425-d6ba19082244,

If all the bees in the bonnets of honorable gentlemen are to buzz out their foolish droning, we may as well give up hope of seeing anything done this session. Each has some pet hobby, some ethnologic figment, as to the equality of the races, the status of the negro, colonization or what not, which he exploits and expounds till he comes to regard himself as committed to his particular hobby; and so a plain subject is obscured, and a desirable measure indefinitely postponed. We call on some sensible legislator to bring back the question from the cloud-land of abstractions whither it has been carried, and restore it to its simple, practical proportions. There is in the country no real division of opinion as to the desirableness of the thing. In fact, if there is one question on which the minds of all loyal and enlightened men are agreed, it is that the ghastly anachronism of Slavery in the Capital of a free Government shall cease. Happily, the measure is wholly free from entanglements of all kinds; is in no wise complicated with any scheme of emancipation, general or particular; is not even the direct offspring of present events; but is the natural development of a mature and settled public policy. A generation ago it was discussed and advocated even by men of the Democratic Party. In 1847 Mr. LINCOLN, then a Whig Representative from the State of Illinois, offered a bill of the like scope and tenor, and Congress, by abolishing the slave-trade in the District twelve years ago, established the premises of which this is but the logical conclusion. In every sense, therefore, it is a just, feasible and timely measure. Besides, the honorable gentlemen who have pet ethnologic hobbies, each clashing with each, cannot do better than assist in the prompt passing of the bill, in some form, to the end that a practical experiment may be made in the District, over which the National Legislature exercises exclusive jurisdiction, as to the actual working of emancipation.

editorial on probability allied peace treaty will be signed,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/23/archives/end-of-the-mexican-intervention-a-treaty-of-peace-celebrated.html,editorial on probability allied peace treaty will be signed,"There is inherent probability in the news which comes from Mexico of the signing and ratification of a treaty of peace. The basis of the treaty had been arranged previously. It required modification in two or three points only, to make it acceptable to both parties, and as JUAREZ was inclined to yield almost anything that should rid Mexico of the abhorred presence of a foreign army, it is not likely any essential difficulty stood in the way of a perfect adjustment. That an Allied force remains for the present in Mexico may seem to contradict this view of the Presidential disposition. But this force has been materially curtailed. The British contingent has been wholly withdrawn, and even the British fleet has left the waters of the Gulf. Two regiments of the Spanish army have returned to Havana, and the remaining troops only linger, we have reason to believe, until the treaty shall have gone to Europe, received the ratification of the several Courts interested, and been returned thus perfected. It would be a palpable error for the expeditionary Generals to retire, until they had learned how far their diplomatic labors might prove acceptable to their respective Cabinets. Thus another of the disheartening war clouds which three months ago rested like a pall upon our people, has been dissipated. Three months ago, Western Europe seemed to be arming against us. All the preparations made by England, France and Spain against Mexico were understood by the most cautious observers to be ultimately intended for the discomfiture of the United States. The armada sent into the Gulf, so disproportioned to the requirements of the Mexican quarrel, was regarded as a preliminary step to the forcible rupture of the blockade, and the abstraction of cotton. The strongly-reinforced squadron of Admiral MILNE, and the French war steamers which frequented our harbors, were evidently destined to the same hostile service, and Canada was prudently armed against the resentment our people would naturally feel at any interference in favor of the South. When our fears ceased to wear this particular guise, they donned others scarcely less discouraging. The threatened imposition of a monarchy upon Mexico the American people could not view with indifference. The rebellion had not annulled the Monroe doctrine. That dogma might be in abeyance so long as our own intestine difficulties should last; but when internal peace should have been conquered, it would be our duty and policy to unseat the usurper, and expel his military supporters from Mexico. A foreign war had thus ceased to be a present, only to become a future evil of alarming proportions. But even this danger has disappeared. By the very prompt arrangement of the European difficulty, President JUAREZ, has secured the permanent independence of his country, has provided for the departure of the Allied army, and saved all necessity of that aid, which this Government would have felt obliged to afford him in circumstances less fortunate. Thus are events better than our fears.

A lively debate ensued, Mr. W.E. FORSTER, that steadfast and consistent friend of the North, leading off against the Irish member, and the Solicitor-General following with an assertion of the practical completeness of the blockade, and a vigorous argument against interference in any form with the American struggle. Mr. GREGORY had only called for papers, a demand which might have been conceded without an abandonment of the ministerial policy; but in its eagerness to mark in an emphatic manner its opposition to all intervention in American affairs, the House negatived Mr. GREGORY's motion without a division. This is certainly a pronounced rebuke of the faction in Parliament -- small and uninfluential at best -- that has put itself forward as the champion of the rebel ""cause."" It also sings the funeral knell of the hopes of the Richmond usurpers for British countenance. Earl RUSSELL has made official announcement that our blockade gives England no ground for complaint, and that so long as the rights of neutrals are not infringed, she must keep hands off. And now the Parliament of the people puts its seal to the same policy; so that we have the double satisfaction to see the British Cabinet clear itself of all suspicion of a sinister design in respect of our internal troubles, and the British nation vindicate its traditional love of fair play. On the whole, we are very glad the present discussion has taken place; for though Mr. GREGORY and his friends designed that it should benefit the South, for which they professed unbounded sympathy, it has rather had the effect to damage their cause, by showing, in a signal manner, how lame and impotent is the argument on which the Secessionist agents have rested their claim for British succor and interference.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Last Hope of the Rebels in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Last Hope of the Rebels in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/36b5ed8b-2719-51fd-b2b3-552818d3e38d,318,nyt://article/36b5ed8b-2719-51fd-b2b3-552818d3e38d,

Editorial on Confederate difficulty of adequately defending all their lines in Southwest,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/23/archives/the-rebel-lines-in-the-southwest.html,Editorial on Confederate difficulty of adequately defending all their lines in Southwest,"The rebel President was correct in saying that, in attempting to defend the whole territory of the Confederate States, seaboard and inland, he had undertaken too much. If his army was twice as great as it now is, he would find it impossible to defend one-half of his present domain from the assaults of the naval and military forces that this Government has in the field. The National power and resources, as compared with those of the rebels, are overwhelming. We are everywhere acting on the offensive; and our columns are so disposed of, that we can advance or strike in the most unexpected quarters, and in the most fatal manner; while at no point, West, East, or on the seaboard, can the rebels succeed in advancing into our territory, or breaking our impregnable lines. Since Mr. DAVIS propounded his theory, three weeks ago, it has had some new and remarkable practical illustrations. He has failed to successfully defend Newbern or any part of the coast of North Carolina; he failed to defend Fernandina, St. Augustine, or any fort or harbor on the eastern line of Florida; he failed to defend Pea Ridge, or the strategic line of Arkansas; he failed to defend New-Madrid and Southwest Missouri; he failed to defend the Tennessee River, or to hinder our advance into Alabama and to the rearward of Memphis; he failed to defend Leesburgh or the Upper Potomac; he has failed on the Lower Potomac, and at Centrevillle and Manassas. At other points, seaboard and inland, soon to be assaulted, he knows that like failure must be certain and irretrievable. As he despondingly says, he undertook too much and failed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Lines in the Southwest.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Lines in the Southwest.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e6084cb-7be9-5e8b-8a73-11a8eebe26f2,1011,nyt://article/9e6084cb-7be9-5e8b-8a73-11a8eebe26f2,

WHITE has remained a prisoner of war in Richmond, until recently exchanged. Having announced his determination to rejoin his regiment in the field, and again fight the battles of his adopted country, a few of his intimate personal friends resolved to present him with a handsome sash, sword and belt, as a slight acknowledgment of their respect and esteem for his gallantry and patriotism. The presentation tool place at the Marshall House, No. 391 Bowery, and the occasion was a highly interesting and convivial one. Ex-Governor MCELYOY in an eloquent speech, in which he feelingly alluded to the long existing friendship between himself and Mr. WHYTE, and the high and honorable character the latter had always borne, presented the testimonial in the name of the friends present. Lieut. WHYTE responded in appropriate and feeling terms, and assured them that the remembrance of their kindly good feeling toward him on that occasion, would nerve his arm to wield the weapon they had just presented him in the hour of conflict. A splendid collation, liberally provided by the worthy host, Mr. MARSHALL, was then partaken of, and a regular feu-de-joie of champagne corks was kept up during the evening by those assembled.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f9e17fd-538c-59c6-80af-b5fe5f2054e6,2327,nyt://article/9f9e17fd-538c-59c6-80af-b5fe5f2054e6,

So frequent and disastreus were these conflagrations, that many of the most wealthy citizens in the vicinity were unable to rest quietly in their beds, un- less a special watchman were employed to guard their premises. A large number of buildings had been very mysteriously set on fire, and some of them were -- owing to the imperfect state of the Fire Department -- wholly consumed. An Episcopal church, five barns, three stables, four shops, two bath-houses, and four or five stores and dwellings have, within three months past, been in flames within an area of about two miles square, and property to the amount of over $12,000 has thus been destroyed. The state of things became alarming, and it was proposed by the poorer class of the inhabitants to organize a fire patrol. The wealthier class of citizens, however, whose Summer residences abound in this section, were for applying to the Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police for assistance. Foremost among the advocates of the former measure was a one-armed sailor, named JOE WILSON, alias JOSEPH DE BEARD, who had recently been an inmate of the Sailor's Snug Harbor, but who, for bad conduct, had been expelled. This man was strong in favor of a private watch, and solicited an appointment for himself. At length he became greatly incensed because the appointment was not granted to him. Application was made to Superintendent KENNEDY, by some of the leading citizens on the Island, and Detectives TIEMAN and ROACH were at once dispatched to find out and arrest, if possible, the guilty party. The suspicions of the officers soon fell on WILSON, and he was watched with great care. About this time the house of the latter was, at a late hour one night, discovered to be on fire. An examination of the premises showed that all his furniture and valuables were packed and carried out of the reach of the flames. These, with many other circumstances, induced the officers to arrest him. On Thursday he had an examination before Justice HAGGERTY, of Richmond County, when he was fully committed upon the charge of arson.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Important Arrest of a Staten Island Incendiary.; A SAILOR IS CHARGED WITH HAVING SET FIRE TO A CHURCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Important Arrest of a Staten Island Incendiary.; A SAILOR IS CHARGED WITH HAVING SET FIRE TO A CHURCH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c2854b2b-a53f-52b4-a5bc-818ae70dc04b,387,nyt://article/c2854b2b-a53f-52b4-a5bc-818ae70dc04b,
Editorial on future of freed Southern Negroes,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/23/archives/the-future-of-the-southern-free-ne-groes.html,Editorial on future of freed Southern Negroes,"We were glad to see, from Secretary CHASE's recent letter in relation to the Port Royal contrabands, or rather freedmen, that the Government is not wholly neglecting the condition of this class. It is of the utmost importance that their condition should be made the subject of careful investigation and judicious planning, based upon an earnest desire to do what is best for them. This is important, not alone on account of the cultivation of the abandoned plantations -- not alone for the sake of the next year's crop of cotton -- nor mainly on these accounts. It is important, on account of the freedmen themselves, and on our own account. For here are thousands of human beings whose status in society has suddenly been changed, who have been heretofore living under a system of laws especially directed against them, which has been at once overthrown, and nothing as yet put in its place; and these people are thrown upon our hands, and we are responsible for them. Heretofore when the sufferings and wrongs of the African race in our land have been brought up before us, we have shielded ourselves by saying that the matter was one entirely out of our control; that we could not, as individuals, exert anything but a moral influence, and not very much of that; and that it was very clear that the thing could not be reached by the General Government, and we could do nothing with the State Governments.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Future of the Southern Free Ne- groes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Future of the Southern Free Ne- groes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ccf914d4-efb3-5b88-a1b6-069c073aaf70,1326,nyt://article/ccf914d4-efb3-5b88-a1b6-069c073aaf70,

The ostensible pretext is to open new railroads and connections, for the purpose of enabling Government to concentrate troops, with dispatch, upon points of military importance, by several routes, thus providing against the failure of one. The real scheme is to finish or undertake, with the Government's money, impracticable railroads, which the section to be traversed does not need -- for if it did, it would build them -- but out of which certain property and shareholders expect to realize ""something handsome."" In proof ofwhich, we beg the public to observe the character of the test project. It is that the Government shall indorse the bonds of the Reading and Columbia Railroad -- a line which, when built, will shorten the inland route from New-York, via Easton, to Washington, 25 miles, by cutting off the detour to Harrisburgh, and running directly from Reading to York, on the Northern Central, and thence to Baltimore, as before. The inland route via Easton and Harrisburgh is 306 miles long; that proposed via Reading and Columbia, is 281 miles, and the route via Philadelphia, is 228 miles.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Military Railroad Job.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Military Railroad Job.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Railroads', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b9e24e7-94f8-514d-b56e-aec1e95ecd1d,903,nyt://article/2b9e24e7-94f8-514d-b56e-aec1e95ecd1d,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/24/archives/british-plans-for-the-defence-of-canada.html,,"A writer in the February number of Blackwood's Magazine, assuming war between England and the United States to be only deferred, addresses himself to the important question, How to prepare for such a contingency, and to conduct it when it comes. He takes it for granted that his countrymen will assail our harbors, burn our fleets, destroy our commerce, and keep our whole seaboard in a state of constant alarm. But, then, there is Canada; that will have to be defended; and, after a sketch of what has been done in former wars, the writer proceeds to show how this should be done. He does not overlook the great changes which have taken place during the last forty-seven years, and as the article is fairly written, and he is evidently well acquainted with his subject, we need make no apology for bringing his views and suggestions before our readers. One of the greatest changes, in a military point of view, has been the construction of the canals required to complete the means of inland navigation afforded by the St. Lawrence and the lakes; and this the writer conceives not to be an advantage on the side of England. ""No dependence,"" he says, ""can be placed upon a series of canals, any one of which runs within fifteen miles of an enemy's frontier. A few bags of gunpowder judiciously applied in a dark night, a few hour's work with pick and spade, by men who have won a brief command of the situation by guile or violence, would break up the whole channel."" Nor does he derive much comfort from turning his eyes toward the Rideau Canal, much as it was at one time counted upon. It would never do, he concludes, to trust to navigation of this sort, assuming the command of the lakes to be as important now to the defence of Canada, as it was half a century ago. Nor do the railways offer any greater facilities. The Grand Trunk has its terminus in American territory, and is carried as far as Montreal on the right bank of the St. Lawrence, never further than sixty, and where nearest, within ten miles of the frontier. The only ports in North America accessible to British men-of-war and transports in Winter are Halifax and St. John, and the position of these relatively to Quebec is such that though, as the bird flies the. nearest of them is within three hundred miles of that city, a railway between them, which would be at all safe, could not be constructed except on a detour of more than 600 miles; and even then a point is at last reached to connect the line with the Grank Trunk which is within ten miles of the frontier. The writer is very angry with Lord ASHBURTON about this, and also for our possession of the fort at Rouse's Point, which commands the approaches to Montreal by Lake Champlain. ""Their facilities of attack,"" says he, ""are by these means greatly increased since 1814, for any number of troops may be moved by these various [American] lines; and so long as the lines continue open, an army, operating in front of them, can be supplied as well and almost as speedily front Boston and New-York as from magazines formed, as of old, at Plattsburg and Oswego.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'British Plans for the Defence of Canada.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'British Plans for the Defence of Canada.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d344c5d-4772-5495-9354-2c8a5d1dc171,1539,nyt://article/2d344c5d-4772-5495-9354-2c8a5d1dc171,

From these causes, it was said, a few months ago, the Government would be compelled to stop the war, and recognize the separate Confederacy of the South. To the same effect ran the current of English journalistic opinion. The depreciation of United States Notes, and the appreciation of Gold, were to prove overwhelmingly disastrous to the Government and the people. Our legal tender measure could be viewed in no other light than as an inflated paper substitute for actual resources -- not as the substantive representative of such resources. So prevalent was this opinion abroad, as well on the Continent as in England, that an exchange of twenty-five per cent. against New-York, and a premium of ten or fifteen per cent. upon Gold, was freely predicted, and so confidently believed as to induce considerable speculations in Gold in this market, through January and February, based upon it. The belief was pardonable in certain Continental quarters, where the disastrous influence of civil outbreaks and exhaustive revolutionary was upon the finances and currency of the peoples engaged in them, has been painfully and repeatedly experienced in the last sixty or seventy years. From English authorities we were entitled to a different judgment, as well upon our material resources as upon the elasticity and endurance of a people kindred with themselves, and by no means wanting in the same practical skill and high credit for carrying on a great war, which were illustrated in their own eventful history from 1796 to 1821, from the rise of NAPOLEON as First Consul to his death at St. Helena, as the deposed Emperor of France. We were entitled to a different judgment also by contrast with the burden of public debt and taxation for its support at present endured by this kindred people. We entered upon the war with a debt no greater than six months' interest upon the present debt of Great Britain. We close the first year of the war with a debt no greater than twelve months' taxation upon the British nation. It was scarcely reasonable and much less generous, therefore, to assume that our National credit and resources were already about to be exhausted, because, like the Bank of England in 1797, the Associated Banks of New-York suspended their payments in specie and the Government thereupon created a lawful tender of United States Notes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Public Credit and Price of Gold.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Public Credit and Price of Gold.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78bf39c4-017a-5638-b2f0-bc4d3715e221,1057,nyt://article/78bf39c4-017a-5638-b2f0-bc4d3715e221,

He said: ""I shall not follow the example of the eloquent orators to whom I am about to reply. I do not wish any more than they to infuse the heat of passion into this debate; but I shall, endeavor to be as clear and precise as their conclusions have appeared to me obscure and mysterious. I admire the vast erudition of M. BONJEAN. The premises of his discourse completely satisfied me. The history, so comprehensive, so profound, so just in its appreciation, which he has given of the inconveniences of the temporal power in Rome was, I need scarcely tell the Senate, quite in harmony with my opinions. I equally applaud and approve the picturesque and ingenious comparison he has made of the two scales of the balance, one the temporal, and the other the spiritual power; and in the result of which he proved, as an invariable lesson of history, that the more the temporal power of the Popes ascends, the more their spiritual influence sinks down. But after these premises -- after this vast historical lesson -- what has been his conclusion? Can he have been serious in it? He argues that the Pope ought to be allowed to reign, but not to govern Rome. It is two years since that conclusion was sought to be applied -- a kind of bastard [???], giving to the King of Italy the Government and to the Pope a species of suzerainty or nominal dominion. But I say nothing new to the Senate when I observe that, whenever statesmen applied themselves to reduce this idea to a practical shape, the pen has dropped from their hands, and they have been forced to recognize that not thus can the solution of the Roman question be attained. Does not such a scheme fall, of itself to the earth before that energetic refusal, absolute for the present, for the future, for all possible eventualities, which the Court of Rome opposes to any compromise? What solution then remains, when one party to the arrangement declines even to discuss any scheme of settlement? There remains that which I propose and demand openly from this tribune, the withdrawal of the troops from Rome. I accept in advance the censure which may be cast on the views I maintain. Let them be denounced as extreme and radical opinions. It matters little whether they are extreme or radical -- the sole consideration of importance is, whether they are just. What has M. DE LA GUEERONIERE proposed in the midst of his elegant phrases, of his antitheses, of his encomiums, showered upon all the world alike, of the flowers of rhetoric with which he has covered Italy and the Popes, Pius IX. and VICTOR EMMANUEL, Count CAVOUR, and Cardinal ANTONELLI -- all very much amazed, no doubt, to find themselves united in that floral wreath with which he has encircled them? [Laughter.] What has he proposed? His rounded, sonorous, purposeless phrases have been but a declaration of impotence. He simply bids us to wait, and to do nothing. To wait for what? Wait until agitation more profoundly shakes mens' minds, and emotions burn up more vividly through Italy, France, and Europe? Until the deplorable divisions which agitate and separate us shall have attained their full destroying strength? Is it in the name of peace and of moderation that we are offered such counsels? I, for one, do not hesitate to say that those counsels are unwise and fatal, and I adjure the Government of this country not to follow them, There is one thing that must be done. The Roman question must be settled. The public mind ought to be quieted both as regards spiritual and material interests. We have had enough of this Roman question. It has done us much injury. It ought to be wound up. I do not hesitate to say that if France, through the organ of its Emperor, takes a firm decision, all this excitement will be stopped. The Emperor would thereby render the greatest service to France and to the whole of Europe. If the Emperor will once openly and decisively apply this solution, peace will be restored to mens' minds, and the agitations of factions will subside with the influence which provoked them. There is one word, gentlemen, which I should rather omit in my speech, and which I was sorry to see mentioned from the tribune -- Venice. There is agitation enough already; we have quite enough on our hands with the Roman question, and as Venice is not mentioned in the address, which would imply so much, I shall allude to it no more in my speech. I do not mean to say that we may not have to allude to it on a future occasion, but this is not the proper moment. I have arisen to-day without discouragement, but not without regret. Indeed, at the close of the discussions of the past year -- a year which has gone through so trying and feverish a crisis -- I had hopes that the Roman question was close upon its solution. I do not purpose entering into the history of this Italian question at such length as some preceding speakers have done. I will simply recall to mind the facts of 1861. An illustrious statesman dies; it was a serious incident, which might have had the most terrible consequences for Italy. How does the Government of the Emperor act? The Government of the Emperor, inspired by a just appreciation of the political situation, recognizes the Kingdom of Italy. That was an act which I cannot speak of in too high terms. The Emperor did not hesitate; he saw that the enemies of Italy might take advantage of that fatal death, and at the very moment that that death might have inflicted a blow upon the cause, the triumph of which we had assured beyond the Alps, he gave it that aid to which is attached the gratitude Italy feels for France. Let those who talk of new territorial arrangements of Italy to suit the Pope remember that when the Emperor recognized the new Kingdom, he aid not recognize merely a word, Italy is not a piece of caoutchouc, to be stretched out and compressed at pleasure. Last year we were bidden to have confidence, and to wait; we were told that there were some obstacles still to be encountered, but that they would disappear, that a little time and a little patience would arrange all. The year has rolled away, and nothing has been obtained. Ave, and if no other policy be pursued, this year too will roll away; years to come, nay centuries, will roll away, and you cannot charge the Court of Rome, because that Court, so long as it has nothing to fear, will yield nothing to reason."" Prince NAPOLEON then recalled to memory the various attempts at compromise recently made by the French Government, and especially the memorable dispatch of M. THOUVENEL, with the reply of M. DE LAVALETTE, inclosing Cardinal ANTONELLI'S ultimatum. ""Why,"" continued the Prince, ""talk of concessions, after an answer like that? The Court of Rome borrows our soldiers, but rejects our counsels. She waits -- yes, there is her great strength; she waits -- for what? I will tell you. She does not hope, indeed, that France will reconquer with its soldiers the the integrity of her old territory for her. No; the Court of Rome knows us too well to indulge in such a dream. She knows too well also her own weakness to flatter herself that she can ever regain of her own power her lost provinces. But she hopes for a foreign auxiliary. She says to herself -- 'Keep up the agitation on the Italian question; never yield -- maintain the status quo -- the future may be big with tempests, and with those tempests may come a foreign army, which after having crushed Italy and perhaps France as well, will be strong enough to reconstitute for us the integrity of our territory. The answer of the Court of Rome to the advice of France, is an indiscreet appeal to Austria. But I shall not weary you by dwelling merely on this phase of the Roman question, and my own appreciation of it. Indeed, I distrust too much the warmth of my own feelings, which, perhaps, I could not restrain. Yes, I love only too warmly the cause of nations and of national liberty. But I district my own power to plead this cause, and I have therefore attempted, by long, serious, and conscientious labor, to sustain myself by arguments not of my own conception. I have sought those arguments in the [???] of diplomacy. I have gone back to the first dispatches which the Ambassadors of France wrote under the ancient monarchy. These extracts, when I pray the Senate to permit me to cite, have but one object -- to prove that the temporal power of the Pope for 150 years has been bad, always bad, no matter what changes of Pontiffs look place -- no matter what varying events have surrounded them. I shall then claim the light to conclude that that power is bad in its essence, even more than in its application; that it has not in it the elements of good government; in a word, that it fails, not because it wishes to be evil, but because it cannot be good -- because the very essence of its organization is evil."" The Prince then quoted a variety of diplomatic and other papers, be-ginning with a letter addressed to LOUIS XIV. by the DUKE DE CHAULNES, in 1667, and coming down to CHATKAUBRIAND and LAMARTINE, all tending to show that the Papal Government of Rome was invariably either the most ruinously helpless, or the most actively injurious. Prince NAPOLEON then quoted the words of NAPOLEON I., which, he said, be would like to hear repeated by NAPOLEON III. In 1808, the Emperor said to the deputies of the old Roman provinces:",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE EMPEROR AND THE POPE.; Prince Napoleon's Speech on the Italian Question.

"The speech of Prince NAPOLEON on the Roman question, which we publish in another column, will be read with interest. It is a scathing exhibit of the evils of the temporal sovereignty, and a fervid and eloquent argument for withdrawing the French troops from Rome and thus allowing the work of Italian freedom and unity to complete itself. The doctrines which the Prince lays down undoubtedly express the views of the whole liberal world of France; and they acquire additional interest from the circumstance that NAPOLEON III. has latterly been willing that the Prince should seem to be his spokesman. It appears, however, that the bold programme put forth by his cousin, the son-in-law of VICTOR EMANUEL, was too much for the Emperor; and on the following day M. BILLAULT, official defender of the Government, declared, in his name, that Prince NAPOLEON's doctrines were not those of the Emperor, and, in fact, were in direct variance with them. Although Italian unity is now a fact which he would be very sorry to see disturbed, such was not the idea with which the Emperor first sent his eagles across the Alps. He did not go to Italy to dethrone sovereigns, or to destroy the power of the Holy See; but to enfranchise it from Austrian domination. What he wished for was the confederation of all the Italian States under the honorary presidency of the Holy Father The French Government ""wished to conciliate the two extremes."" This expression, without doubt, faithfully represents the actual position of NAPOLEON III. For, while there is every evidence that he personally sympathizes with the views of Prince NAPOLEON, he is at the same time convinced that if the troops were removed from Rome, and that city became the Capital of Italy, there would be no possibility of containing the exuberance of the Italian people, who would then throw themselves upon the Austrians in Venetia, and bring about a European war in which France would be obliged to take a part -- a sequence of events for which His Majesty is not at all ready.

Parliament discusses Southern blockade; opposes intervention; Confederate batteries reported strong; losses heavy on both sides,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/25/archives/the-american-question-the-blockade-in-the-house-of-commons-speeches.html,Parliament discusses Southern blockade; opposes intervention; Confederate batteries reported strong; losses heavy on both sides,"In the House of Commons on the 7th inst., Mr. GREGORY said: Sir, before going into Committee of Supply I wish to call the attention of the House to a subject which I conceive to be one of the most important that can be brought under its notice. [Hear, hear.] Perhaps, Sir, I owe some explanation to the House for having chosen a supply night for the discussion of this question; but I trust the House will allow that I have not been infringing upon a Government night unnecessarily, because the public business has been proceeded with so rapidly that I think they, may well spare a night for the discussion of so important a question. [Hear, hear.] Then I think its was absolutely necessary not to postpone the consideration of this question any longer -- [hear, hear] -question involving matters of international law, and a question likewise affecting the welfare of the working classes of this country, [Hear.] I am now induced to select this evening for the discussion of this question, because my honorable friend, the member for Liverpool, (Mr. HORSFALL.,) has given notice of his intention, on Tuesday next, to call the attention of the House to attestions of international law; and I thought it was, most essential that this special question of the blockade of the porta of the Confederate States should not be mixed up with other question of international law without it forming, first of all, the subject of a separ-ate discussion. [Hear.] When, in the month of May last the malls brought over to this county the reply of Mr. SEWARD, the American Secretary of State, to Gov. HICKS, of Maryland, I confess that no one in this House reechoed more heartily than myself the expression whch the noble Lord the Foreign Secretary made use of when he said: ""Thank God, we have hitherto refrained from all Interference in these American dissensions."" Gov. HICKS, of Maryland, being a man of prudence and humanity, an being anxious to spare his State the horrors of civil war, proposed to Mr. SEWARD the mediation of England. Mr. SEWARD replied that, under no circumstances, would he submit their internal, ffairs to theto the arbitrament of any Foreign Power, and least of all to the arbitrament of a European Monarchy. Now, Sir, I think, had we been in the position of the United States, with dismemberment threatening every portion of her dominions, with a bloody civil war impending, we might have replied that we would not submit our internal dissensions to any Foreign Power; but I hardly think we would have thrown in the gratuitous affront; that, least of all, we should submit our Internal affairs to the arbitrament of an American Republic. Seeing then, that these were the sentiments which animated those to whom the destinies of the United States are confided, I assure the House I deprecate interference now as I deprecated interference then, quite as fully as the noble lord. But it may be in the recollection of the House that, early in the last session of Parliament, I gave notice of my intention to bring before Parliament the expediency of recognizing the Southern American Confederation. I can assure the House I did so without the slightest intention of advocating interference. I did so in the hope that the united action of France and England -- for I was in hopes that united action might possibly be procured -- would have given great moral weight to the many humane, benevolent and far-sighted men in the Northern States, who were anxious at that time for a peaceable separation; and that it would have induced the Ministers of the United States to pause ere they plunged their countrymen and themselves into the vortex of a ruinous, fratricidal, and allow me to add, in spite of the news recently arrived, what I firmly believe to be a hopeless contest. [Cheers from the Opposition benches.] When the night for the discussion of that motion came on, my honorable and gallant friend opposite appealed to me not to proceed with it; and that appeal was so evidently in accordance with the general wish of the House that I did not hesitate to acquiesce. My honorable friend, no doubt, thought that in the course of the debate expressions calculated to promote imitation might have been made use of, likely to endanger peace between England and America. Now, I can assure my honrable friend, that, so far as I was concerned, I should have made use of no irritating expression. I should have affirmed then, as, undeterred by what has occurred since, I affirm now, that secession was a right, that separation is a fact, and that reconstruction is an impossibility. I should have additionally stated that all my heart and sympathies were with one portion of the American people -- not that portion that is fighting for empire; but with that portion which is struggling for independence. [Cheers from the Opposition benches.] It I rejoiced to acknowledge these sentiments on the occasion of Bull Run, I am not going to slink from them now, on the occasion of Donelson. If that discussion had been permitted to have gone on, I should have endeavored to show the House what has since been better shown by Mr. SPENCE, in his admirable book on the causes of secession, and the right which the Southern States claim to separate. I should have endeavored to show that, in recognizing a Government which I consider to be a Government of stability de jure and de facto, we should have been acting in accordance with our usual practice; and, perhaps. I should have been tempted to quote a celebrated dispatch of the noble Secretary for Foreign Affairs upon the revolution in Italy, as bearing upon this question. I should have endeavored to show, not paradoxically, but I think conclusively, to those who hate Slavery and the Slave-trade in their heart, that separation of the United States was the circumstance of all others most likely to lead to the realization of their hopes -- [hear, hear] -- and that the reconstruction of the Union was the circumstance of all others most likely to lean to the strengthening of the one and the spread of the other. I should also have referred to the short-sighted and selfish commercial policy that now prevails, and which is openly acknowledged throughout the Northern States, and which, if it be not rendered hopeless and nugatory by the independence of the South, will not merely shut out from 30,00,000 of customers the manufactures of Europe, but will rely upon it, ere long, breed a crop of troubles most dangerous to the peace of this country. [Hear, hear.] I do not quarrel in the slightest degree with the House of Commons for the feeling that it expressed on that occasion. It was a proof, at all events, to the world at large, of concilation and good will. But I am sorry the discussion did not take place, because it would have come from an independent member, whose authority was nothing but a mere statement of his own opinions, and because I conceive that a free nation, accustomed to free comments on the actions of other nations, had no right to consider itself aggrieved by a free comment on an event of such enormous magnitude to the world as this. [Hear, hear.] And not only that, but became I believe the attitude of the House of Commons on that occasion was not interpreted by the United States as a proof of conciliation I and friendship, but that it was considered to be the result of fear -- [Cheers from the Opposition] -- and that it encouraged that opinion of which we have had so many practical proofs, that whereas it may be dangerous to [???] with France, any outrage and insult may be given to England with impunity. [Hear, hear.] Now, I am not going to press the subject of recognition, or say any more upon [???] at present, because, in my opinion, the great and pressing reason that induced me to bring it forward list year has passe away -- namely, the hope that the tide. of battle might be stayed. I shall confine myself throughout the remainder of the remarks that I am about to make strictly and closely to the question of the blockade. I shall not travel one inch beyond that question, lest I might provoke other honorable members to wander into discussions which are foreign to the notice when I have placed on the paper. [Hear, hear.] I think I may fairly say that this question of the blockade of the Southern ports of America is a question of the most vital importance, not merely to England, but to the whole world. It is a question of importance to Eng and as regards the national character for honor, good faith, and justice, and a regards the daily bread of multitudes of our working men. To the world at large it is a question of the most vast importance with regard to the interpretation of a great question of international law; it is a matter of importance in every part of the globe where the culture of cotton is likely to be brought about; and it is a matter of great importance as regards the manufacture of those articles which are likely to reach the continent of America, subject to the announcement that the country will receive from Her Majesty's Government. I must justify myself when I say that this is a matter in which the national character for good faith and justice is concerned.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMERICAN QUESTION.; THE BLOCKADE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS Speeches of Mr. Gregory, W.E.

"At the time of the escape of the Sumter from Martinique, we took occasion to express our indignation at what, judging from this distance, and with our then lights, we regarded as the culpable negligence of the blockading officer, Capt. JAMES S. PALMER, of the Iroquois. Hurt by the suspicions and imputations which his conduct called out, Capt. PALMER immediately asked to be recalled, and demanded a Court of Inquiry. Owing to the exigencies of the service, a Court of Inquiry could not be accorded him, but his case was referred to the Naval Board, at Brooklyn, which, ""having maturely considered the matter,"" fully exonerated him from any blame in the matter of the escape of the Sumter; and the Secretary of the Navy has just reappointed him to the command of the Iroquois. The official papers in the case, which we have seen, are further strengthened by the testimony of American residents at St. Thomas, who state the charges against Capt. PALMER are to their knowledge wholly groundless. We take pleasure in giving these facts the same publicity had by our animadversions. We may, perhaps, remark, however, that these animadversions were called forth not so much by the charges which were published against Captain PALMER, and some of which we took occasion to discredit from the first, as by a seeming want of pluck and gallantry on his part -- a lack which, in the state of the public fortunes and feelings at the time, was almost as bad as a positive crime.

Owing to the exigencies of the service, a Court of Inquiry could not be accorded him, but his case was referred to the Naval Board, at Brooklyn, which, ""having maturely considered the matter,"" fully exonerated him from any blame in the matter of the escape of the Sumter; and the Secretary of the Navy has just reappointed him to the command of the Iroquois. The official papers in the case, which we have seen, are further strengthened by the testimony of American residents at St. Thomas, who state the charges against Capt. PALMER are to their knowledge wholly groundless. We take pleasure in giving these facts the same publicity had by our animadversions. We may, perhaps, remark, however, that these animadversions were called forth not so much by the charges which were published against Captain PALMER, and some of which we took occasion to discredit from the first, as by a seeming want of pluck and gallantry on his part -- a lack which, in the state of the public fortunes and feelings at the time, was almost as bad as a positive crime.

editorial on continued hold-out of island,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/26/archives/island-number-ten.html,editorial on continued hold-out of island,"-- It is just ten days since the National guns opened fire upon Island Ten; and though the bombardment has been going on steadily but slowly ever since, the island still holds out against the United States. Commodore FOOTE has been compelled to adopt an entirely different style of tactics from that in which he has heretofore achieved fame. At Fort Henry and fort Donelson he ran his boats close upon the enemy's water batteries, but on this occasion he engages them at the long taw of between two and three miles. This makes the fight less exciting than it would otherwise be, and greatly lengthens its duration. But the reports of successive days' work show that the reduction of the stronghold is certain. A large number of the heavy rebel guns have been dismounted, both of the island and of the shore batteries; and, at latest reports, the rebels appeared to be evacuating the island and getting over to the eastern mainland, preparatory to a retreat Southward. The ""situation"" at this Southwestern battle-field is quite interesting; -- the fortified island in the river, supported by the rebel batteries on the eastern shore, and by the rebel gunboats, floating battery and ram, which closely hug the island itself; above the island, a couple of miles, the National gunboats and mortar floats in constant play; below the island, on the western shore of the river, Gen POPE's open and masked batteries, and his large land force, preventing a rebel retreat down stream; while, furnishing the rebels their only means of retreat, on the eastern shore there is a narrow road, leading through the swamps to the railroad, which runs southward. By, this route the rebel islanders expect to make, or are now making, their exit, with the purpose, most likely, of moving to Jackson, and there reinforcing BEAUREGARD, perhaps, going down the Mississippi to Fort Randolph, the next stronghold on the river. But, if we are able to hold them any length of time at Number Ten, they will give us an opportunity of cutting off even this solitary line of retreat, and bagging the whole of this division of the rebel army. It is to be hoped the opportunity will be embraced.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ISLAND NUMBER TEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ISLAND NUMBER TEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/217c4370-b925-5191-bada-8ea12991082c,372,nyt://article/217c4370-b925-5191-bada-8ea12991082c,

Three months ago it was for armed intervention, and it was only the strong predisposition of the British people to peace that checked the desire of the small but influential party of which the Times is the mouthpiece, to take a vigorous part in the fight. Happily, the timely spirit of concession on the side of our Government reinforced the peace party in England, and balked the Times. To-day, always eager for the fray, the Times urges a peaceable intervention. Great Britain is recommended as a mediator between the warring sections. The North, we are instructed, has now recovered the lost prestige of arms. Its superiority in the field, as well as in the Council Chamber and the Treasury vault, is demonstrated.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/26/archives/the-wounded-heroes-of-newbern.html,,"-- A CHANCE FOR THE CHARITABLE. -- The heroism and the triumphs of the National soldiers in North Carolina have already been fully chronicled by the Press; and Roanoke and Newbern among battles, and Gen. BURNSIDE among commanders, and the Eastern troops among soldiers, now stand in the foremost rank in the mind of the nation. The roll of the dead at the last sanguinary battle contains over a hundred names, every man a hero. For thesetheir country can now do nothing but honor their memories. But there still live nearly five hundred wounded men who, less than a fortnight ago, faced the rebel batteries along the Neuse River, and were enfiladed by the rebel cannon. Many of these were severely wounded, others maimed for life, some made invalids for months and every day sees the number of the battle-tried heroes lessened by death. Some sixty of the badly-wounded men have been sent eastward by Gen. BURNSIDE, and arrived at this port last night. They are mostly poor men, and nearly all New-Englanders. They need aid, attention and kindness while they are in our midst, and whatever they need, we are sure that the ever-generous citizens of New-York are anxious to furnish. Some of them were taken from the vessel last night to those friendless, dismal sheds, the Park barracks, and some were left on hoard the ship that brought them. This is not as it should be. The barracks constitute a horrible hospital for suffering men, a wretched place for physicians to operate, and a fearful, chilly spot to die in. New-York should do better than that; its patriotic citizens should make more Christian provision for the brave men who may be unfortunately cast on their charity. And it will do so as soon as the facts are laid before it. We have learned that the Sanitary Commission did what was possible under the circumstances to relieve these men; but, after all, that did not amount to anything like comfort for them. The Government has made no suitable provision for them, and the duty falls back upon private beneficence. Let every man and woman who desires the benediction of Heaven, and who loves the land for which those our countrymen have offered their lives, see that this morning does not pass away without furnishing aid that will relieve at least one soldier. The citizens and ladies of Louisville have won the gratitude and admiration of the whole country for their untiring self-devotion to the wounded and sick Union soldiers of the West. Those of New-York have been negligent and dilatory. The newspapers of New-England complain of the way in which the wounded at Roanoke were treated when here. Such things must not be permitted to occur in future.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WOUNDED HEROES OF NEWBERN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WOUNDED HEROES OF NEWBERN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d4045b4-c780-5128-b965-686338a11565,561,nyt://article/3d4045b4-c780-5128-b965-686338a11565,

We believe this classification good, not only for Florida, but to afford a fair exhibit of the temper of mind of the population of the whole South. It is precisely the experience our Union armies have everywhere met with in their advance into the insurgent States. In some sections the presence of the National troops has been hailed with genuine and unaffected demonstrations of joy -- it was so at Florence, Ala., and up the Tennessee. In other sections, the most stubborn and virulent animosity has been shown -- it has been so in South Carolina; and though some of our soldiers at Port Royal have amused themselves in taming a crocodile, we have yet to hear that they have succeeded in taming a South Carolinian planter. Not that we have any doubt of the success of the experiment under the right conditions; we simply mean that there has been no spontaneous exhibition of loyalty among the class named. But no doubt the frame of mind of the largest proportion of the Southern population is accurately portrayed in the phrase we have quoted -- they ""care very little about the matter."" They are neither very much of Secessionists nor very much of Unionists, and had just about as lief that the one cause should triumph as the other. They have accepted the rebellion, if that term can be applied to a mere passive acquiescence; and were, under the first effervescence of excitement, even ready to enter the rebel army: but this artificial stimulus has long ceased to be operative, while the bitter experience of those in the ranks, and the distress of those at home, have wrought their inevitable reaction. These, therefore, wherever our armies show themselves in the insurgent States, will quietly submit to the old authority -- without ardor or enthusiasm, or, indeed, any sentiment worth speaking of, but a feeling of selfish satisfaction at being relieved of the suffering and loss which the rebellion brought to their door.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Benumbed Patriotism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Benumbed Patriotism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c1f0aa1-87ff-5b93-af3f-44232ff1a48c,889,nyt://article/6c1f0aa1-87ff-5b93-af3f-44232ff1a48c,

The latest forgery of the Parisian journal is, as usual, in the interest of its rebellious friends. It consists in a scheme of compromise which, it says, has been arranged between the Governments of Mr. LINCOLN and JEFF. DAVIS, in accordance with which the war will be brought to an end in June. The secession of the Gulf and Atlantic Slave States will, we are told, be accepted as a fact, while Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri will be retained by the North. A frontier without custom-houses, repeal of all fugitive laws and treaties, and prospective emancipation, are the conditions proposed by the rebels as an equivalent for their independence, and accepted by the Federal Government. It is needless of course to warn an American reader of the folly and falsity of such fabrications. But in Europe their inanity is less conspicuous. There they serve the fallacious purpose of showing what sacrifices the South is ready to make for peace, and how relentlessly and cruelly the North persists in war.

But, besides its general probability, her valorous commander, PEGRAM, had given out, with ominous nod, that he would never, never, never allow the craft to be taken, and it was stated in the London papers that valves were so arranged that he could blow her out of the water at a moment's notice. The later tidings received, however, assign a far more satisfactory though not so theatrical an end to the Nashville, which, instead of shooting up in flames athwart the sky, as an illustration of Southern ultimate destruction in the maritime line, has, we learn, fallen into the hands of the blockaders, and is now on the fair way of being restored to her rightful owners. For it must be borne in mind that the Nashville is stolen goods, being mainly the property of loyal owners in this City, a circumstance which makes her recovery all the more satisfactory; for while we have no great objection to the rebels' burning ships or anything else that belongs to them, if that sort of feu de jois afford them any gratification, we have a most ""Yankee"" opposition to their using our property to make their bonfires withal. Why PEGRAM did not do something desperate we are left to conjecture. He seems to have hoped he would be able to run out of Beaufort with as much ease as he ran in; and seeing the advance of the National force, he put on steam and rushed into the arms of the Yankee blockaders. This must certainly be a very prosaic finale for this notorious craft in the estimation of those ardent Southern imaginations; but it suits the ""Yankee"" notion pretty well.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fate of the Nashville.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fate of the Nashville.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/962d2fc0-7678-5d10-ac13-287b6520dd74,330,nyt://article/962d2fc0-7678-5d10-ac13-287b6520dd74,

Neither beds, bandages, food nor attendance at all adequate to the emergency had been provided; and our poor fellows found themselves set ashore in the wealthiest city of this continent, suffering from wounds which had never been thoroughly dressed, with their sufferings aggravated by their journey, and on a cold, blustering March night, no comfort awaited them, no welcome greeted them. A few surgeons and private citizens of other callings, hastily gathered, did what they could for them; but although only between eighty and ninety arrived that night, there were not even bandages and lint enough at hand to make a single change in the dressings of all; and some had their wounds bound up again in the same bandages in which they had been for twenty-four hours. With few exceptions, an unmitigated pine table was their only couch.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. Mine. DE LUSSAN made her debut, last evening, before an audience that was both distinguished in numbers and character.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/27/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mme. DE LUSSAN made her debut, last evening, before an audience that was both distinguished in numbers and character. The opera selected for the occasion was ""La Favorita"" -- a work which has always been a favorite with our public, but has been laid on the shelf of late, owing to the dearth of dramatic singers. It argues well for Mme. DE LUSSAN's self-reliance that she selected so important and exacting a role as Leonora. Perhaps a milder ordeal would have been better, but under the circumstances, it was passed through with a fair share of success. Although visibly affected by stage-fright, and consequently deprived of the full benefit of her powers, Mme. DE LUSSAN succeeded, in the first act, in creating an extremely favorable impression. Her voice is a mezzo-soprano, of good compass and quality, which the lady uses judiciously, but with an energy at times not conducive to good intonation. It appears to be worn in the middle register and afflicted with a tremolo throughout, a serious blemish, which, like singing out of tune, we hope to see removed on future performances. That the lady possesses talent, is as evident as the fact that her voice is naturally full and pleasing. But we could not help remarking that the first act was by far the best, notwithstanding the great trepidation under which the lady labored. The fatigue of the unaccustomed effort became more and more noticeable as the opera progressed, and hence the opinion we have formed is based almost exclusively on the section we have referred to. Madame DE LUSSAN was called out during the evening and gallantly bouquetted. Her friends, indeed, were more than satisfied with her success.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6745d41a-9216-5452-83cb-ff2eee93cfb8,655,nyt://article/6745d41a-9216-5452-83cb-ff2eee93cfb8,

"A WOMAN CHARGED WITH FRAUD -- LAWYERS THE VICTIMS. -- MARY ANN JAGGERS, aged about 50 years, residing at No. 31 Northmore-street, was brought before Justice KELLY, yesterday, by Detective WILSON, upon the charge of false pretences. The prisoner called upon JOHN B. MOORE, a short time since, and represented to him that she had recently had a fortune left her of over $75,000; and requested him to invest $50,000 of it for the benefit of her children. She was not particular about the rate of interest, and promised to let MOORE, -- whom she wished to make her agent, -- have all the interest over three per cent. which could be obtained on the money. The investments were to be made in his name, and he was to have the entire charge of the funds. During the negotiations, Mrs. J. stated that she had a few small bills to pay, and MOORE, not suspecting anything wrong, was persuaded to advance her the sum of $173. He soon discovered, however, that the woman's representations were all unfounded, and that the deeds, bonds, notes, &c., which had been left with him were worthless. About the same time three other gentlemen of this City, viz.: D.B. PIKE, W.B. SMITH, (lawyer, of No. 114 Nassau-street,) and Mr. PARKER, of the Register's Office, were swindled by the accused -- the two former of $100 each and the latter of $170.

The Liberal party took manful ground against the Government for thus deserting the traditions of the country by forcible intervention in the domestic affairs of another people, and argued cogently the folly of levying war on a grand scale to collect a debt of $150,000. The apologists of Government denied any intention to interfere forcibly with the institutions of Mexico. They stated the motive of the Government to be, beyond the recovery of debts justly due French subjects, the protection of the lives and property of such of those subjects as are resident or transient in Mexico. The proverbial insecurity of life among the Mexicans was presented clearly. It is the highest duty of a Government to protect its citizens wherever enterprise may carry them; and the fulness of time had been reached for obtaining strong guarantees from the Government of Mexico for the safety of Frenchmen. If in procuring these guarantees the assistance of French arms shall be voluntarily solicited by the Mexican people as an aid to reforming their political system, and inaugurating the reign of order, the Imperial Government is not disposed to withhold such aid; nor, on the other hand, is it disposed to thrust it upon the nation unasked.

The step seems to have been taken purely at the suggestion of a too sensitive conscience, and upon the impulse of private reasons, that if made public would only add to the esteem with which Dr. HAWKS is regarded in the community; and the force and pressure of which can only be appreciated by himself. When, therefore, our meddlesome cotemporaries obtrude their advice they do so to parties who may reasonably protest against the impertinence. They know nothing of the motives animating the clergyman; they entirely fail to understand or sympathize with the devotion of his flock. And as a rule, the case of the diocese is so safe in the hands of Bishop POTTER, that Episcopa lians generally will be willing to dispense with the oversight of these self-consecrated bishops in partibus.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DR.

editorial on Border States Congressmen's reaction to message,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/28/archives/jefferson-davis-and-garret-davis.html,editorial on Border States Congressmen's reaction to message,"Mr. HENDERSON, the newly appointed Senator from Missouri, has signalized his debut in the Senate by showing that one at least of the representatives from the Border States is able to appreciate the crisis, and to measure his duty. The President's Emancipation Message has proved indeed too serious a test for the patriotism of the Border State Members. A few of them, like Mr. BLAIR of Missouri, who acts in accordance with settled principles, have adopted the Presidential policy with enthusiasm. The greater number of them, on the contrary, array themselves boldly against the plan; some of them dare to impugn the lofty motives of Mr. LINCOLN; and there is a general agreement in the sentiments, that the proposed resolution is a more or less decisive interference with State rights; that it is a cover for the secret assaults of the Abolitionists; and if adopted, that it will become possible to discuss Slavery in Kentucky as we discuss a tariff or tax in New-York, namely, without fear of immediate evisceration. These results, such men as POWELL, and DAVIS, and SAULSBURY, denounce unreservedly; and they presume to threaten unspeakable alternatives should Congress venture a response to the executive suggestion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jefferson Davis and Garret Davis.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Jefferson Davis and Garret Davis.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/094a6fad-c6f6-5096-9416-545d6c634155,1105,nyt://article/094a6fad-c6f6-5096-9416-545d6c634155,
"-- The telegram sent from Washington last Sunday, in regard to the probable capture of the City of New-Orleans, has not yet been verified by any arrivals from our Gulf contingent. A Memphis paper has indeed announced that Fort Pike, which guards the passage-way from Lake Borgne to Lake Ponchartrain, was in our hands; but we have no news of any general assault on the works lining the shore of the latter lake, in the rear of the city, nor on those upon the river, below the city, much less of the capture of the city itself. It is not likely, indeed, that Gen. BUTLER would think it prudent to actually occupy a metropolis which, according to the last census, had a population of nearly two hundred thousand souls, with the small force under his command; and such a thing as bombarding or destroying the Crescent City is of course not intended. New-Orleans is known to be fortified in the most extensive and formidable manner at every direction of approach. If the rebel papers have not exaggerated in their description of these fortifications, there never was a city so strongly defended since mankind began to build cities. To reduce these works will require the labors of the mortar fleet, and of the naval and land contingent, for not a few days. Should we succeed in destroying and capturing these defences, and getting naval control of the river and the lake, we can then hold the city at our mercy, and give the Union clement a chance to assert itself. It would not be at all surprising if the first decisive demonstration in favor of the Union in the South should take place in the greatest city of the South.

Editorial on observations of London Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/28/archives/britain-and-america-the-tone-of-the-times.html,Editorial on observations of London Times,"The London Times draws from the late discussion on the blockade in Parliament, two or three conclusions for the especial benefit of people on this side of the water. The North, it says, will learn from it ""how unjust way the suspicion that we took advantage of the Trent affair in order to obtain an excuse for liberating the cotton of the South."" There is some truth in this and some error. We undoubtedly thought that the cotton was a temptation to England. But we considered the action of England in the Trent affair as springing far more from the hostility of her aristocracy to our institutions, which have been so long a thorn in their side. And we considered the want of cotton rather as a weapon used by this unscrupulous party to drive the people of England into the adoption of measures which would, they thought, secure the result which they desired, in the permanent disruption of this country. We do not see much in the debate to convict us of injustice in this suspicion. But we do see, and we heartily rejoice to see, that the efforts of this party are less likely to secure success than ever; that those who are in sympathy with us and our principles are stronger than ever before, and that the day may not be far distant, when the voices of malignant carping, and the whispers of unjust suspicion, will be entirely overborne by notes of hearty sympathy and good fellowship, and when even the London Times will join in swelling the chorus of acclaim which ever waits upon success. We already see in its columns symptoms indicative of this result. Who would have believed, three months ago, that we should find in that paper a confession that ""nobody can deny the colossal scale, the multifarious plan and the exhaustive energy of the operations of the Federal Government?"" The words sound strangely after the diatribes upon our utter lack of plan, the inefficiency of the means employed, and the inertness and incompetency displayed by us, to which, we have been accustomed from that quarter.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Britain and America The Tone of the Times.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Britain and America The Tone of the Times.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b3b26cc6-b586-5f2e-8bfc-ec6eb078d292,773,nyt://article/b3b26cc6-b586-5f2e-8bfc-ec6eb078d292,

But the statement that she has escaped to sea has a firmer foundation than either of the others; for it comes direct from one of the blockading ships which she passed on her way out, and which, it seems, fired several ineffectual shots, with the hope of provoking a fight. The next, probably, that we shall hear of this audacious pirate will be, that, after coaling at some one of the West India Islands, she has crossed the seas and entered the harbor of Southampton, which she left on her way hither only a few weeks ago. Whether or not, by way of diversion, she will burn a few of our merchantmen on her passage across, and carry their crews in irons into an English port; and whether or not, on her return to Southern waters -- perhaps a few weeks hence -- she will bring a cargo of Enfield rifles and rifled cannon, to be used by the rebels at some new Newbern, a very short time will tell.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pirate Nashville Again on the Seas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pirate Nashville Again on the Seas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2d31d5b-6ce1-5565-9259-ea7242e07011,764,nyt://article/e2d31d5b-6ce1-5565-9259-ea7242e07011,

April,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/29/archives/the-magazines.html,April,"Harper's New Monthly, for April, just out, excels its predecessors for the year in many respects. The illustrated papers with which it opens are remarkably good. ""Pambookat; A Fairy Tale of the Malays,"" is the first of these, and, with rich and tasteful illustration, gracefully romanticises the wonders of the steam-engine, the electric telegraph, the sewing-machine, chloroform, &c. ""Caricature and Caricaturists,"" with its odd, quaint pictures, is a gem of criticism and research. ""The Building of the Ship"" is the third pictorial paper, and is alike valuable and interesting. Continuations of ""Orley Farm,"" by ANTHONY TROLLOPE,"" ""The Adventures of Philip,"" by THACKERAY, and of ""Mistress and Maid,"" by Miss MULOCX, are prominent features. We are not of the number, however, who admire the nondescript cuts that accompany the former two productions. The original designs of our home artists are better in every particular. The latter are brighter, more graceful, more expressive, and infinitely less affected. The American drawings connected with ""American History, Biography, Industry, Character and Scenery"" afford positive relief after the contemplation of the sombre, blurred, slovenly or overstrained designs with which some of the latter English novels have been deformed. This very number of Harper's affords abundant proof of our assertion. Two or three good stories, such as ""Calico and Chatterbox,"" ""My Special Contributor,"" and as many excellent sketches, including ""Camp Life at the Relay,"" ""Shays' Rebellion,"" ""Fitz-Greene Halleck,"" and ""The Contest in America,"" an essay from Fraser's Magazine, by JOHN STUART MILL, with the ever-welcome Editor's Easy Chair, Drawer and Foreign Bureau, and the usual supplement of Monthly Fashions and Caricature, complete this acceptable number.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Magazines', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/16b644af-17b1-5821-b4e6-42dd158b2e9d,824,nyt://article/16b644af-17b1-5821-b4e6-42dd158b2e9d,

Editorial on reconstruction of state government in Tennessee,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/29/archives/the-state-government-of-tennessee.html,Editorial on reconstruction of state government in Tennessee,"The last advices from Tennessee add to the number of able and prominent men who have intimated their readiness to cooperate with Gov. JOHNSON in reconstructing the State Government. We cannot vouch for the weight of authority upon which certain prominent names have been mentioned, but in nearly every instance we know that most, if not all, the antecedents of such gentlemen as BAILIE PEYTON,A.O.P. NICHOLSON, CAVE JOHNSON, WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL, WILLIAM H. POLK, and WILLIAM B. STOKES are in favor of the Union. Mr. NICHOLSON was the colleague of Mr. ANDREW JOHNSON in the United States Senate; a moderate, conservative man, opposed to Nullification, as propounded by Mr. CALHOUN, and to Southern rights, as urged by the South Carolina delegation in the Nashville Convention of 1850. He declined to return to the Senate, at the special Session in July, in deference to the action of the State Legislature in June, but took no active part in the rebellion. A Baltimore contemporary states that he has written a letter professing his cooperation with Gov. JOHNSON in the good work of restoring order and authority to the State Government, as part of the National Union. Ex-Gov. WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL was ready last Summer to oppose secession, but shrunk from the prominence which many of his Union friends desired to give him, because of the defection of BELL and HENRY and the EWINGS. In regard to the position of WILLIAM H. POLK, there has at no time been a serious doubt. He was among the first to escort JOHNSON to the capitol on his arrival at Nashville. Mr. STOKES is an Ex-Member of Congress, representing the Mountain or Upper Cumberland District of the State, in which Gov. CAMPBELL also resides. We have seen nothing direct from Mr. CAVE JOHNSON or Mr. PEYTON in reference to their cooperation with Gov. JOHNSON, but, as intimated above, their opposition to the whole secession movement is well understood, both at home and abroad.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF TENNESSEE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF TENNESSEE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/27148b60-4be7-5592-a005-4f19444a8d96,327,nyt://article/27148b60-4be7-5592-a005-4f19444a8d96,

For this narrative we are indebted to the Parliamentary blue book recently submitted to the House of Commons; a source we are at pains to mention, because it fully authenticates the extraordinary story. A story most extraordinary indeed, and most interesting. Early in the Fall of last year, the Spanish Government gave official warning to the Cabinets of Franco and Great Britain of its intention to submit its claims upon Mexico to the adjudication of arms. At the same time it expressed an earnest desire to have the cooperation of the two Powers addressed, whose claims were even more important than those of Spain. The proposition was favorably entertained. But at the very outset the British Ministers demanded guarantees that the expedition should not be used to interfere with the domestic affairs of the peccant Republic. No pretence, Earl RUSSELL exacted, should be permitted to authorize the substitution of a new form of government for that created by the Mexicans themselves; or to use the language of his dispatch, he insisted upon a preliminary declaration by the combined Powers.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The British Blue Book About Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The British Blue Book About Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-03-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a623f37-c837-5b0e-901c-8c7660b1ce9a,1034,nyt://article/2a623f37-c837-5b0e-901c-8c7660b1ce9a,

There was nothing in it to excite our wonder, though we were somewhat surprised to see such few and feeble efforts made in support of Mr. GREGORY's very clever and adroit statement of his untenable case, and so calm, decided, and vigorous a tone, in the speakers who led the overwhelming opposition to his motion. We looked for a fiercer onslaught and a more apologetic defence. We expected the cry, ""Down with the blockade,"" to rise from a chorus of voices, and the answer to be, ""Wait.""

"The citizens of St. Louis have just had made for them a handsome sword, which they intend presenting to Major-Gen. FREMONT. It is a magnificent affair, and cost upward of a thousand dollars. The blade is of the finest Damascus manufacture, chased in gilt, and bears the Latin word Vero. The scabbard is a heavy one, of sterling silver, finely gilded. The terminating and lower bands of the scabbard represent oak leaves. The upper band is very heavy and rich in appearance; the top part of it represents a casque, with plumes, battle-axes, spears and lanceheads, on the obverse.

We have recently had a most satisfactory exhibition of a private military academy, but it must be remembered that the Public Schools differ from such, in that they are composed of all classes of social condition, and in far greater numbers. It becomes necessary, therefore, to select from among these such boys as display aptitude for the stricter disciplines of military tactics. This has been done in two, at least, of our first-class schools, and in one it has been carried to a great degree of perfection, so that the youthful company of cadets can bear comparison with the best trained bodies of private academies. They belong to School No. 10, in Wooster-st., and form daily in the large covered area attached to the school, or in pleasant weather they repair to a neighboring park, and go through their manoeuvres, to the high satisfaction of the crowd which so novel a sight usually collects. These little fellows bear proudly aloft their rich silken banners, engraven with their title in letters of gold, ""Robinson Zouaves,"" which is in honor of their instructor, who himself is a soldier of long practical experience, having shared the perils of glorious war during the entire Mexican campaign.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Military Tactics in Our Public Schools.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Military Tactics in Our Public Schools.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-03-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2414cf61-89a9-551d-b4b6-04b367422ba2,496,nyt://article/2414cf61-89a9-551d-b4b6-04b367422ba2,
Editorial on British views of blockade,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/30/archives/a-gregorian-view-of-ameican-sentiment.html,Editorial on British views of blockade,"Mr. GREGORY, in his speech on the blockade, in Parliament, spoke affectionately of the ""many humane, benevolent and far-sighted men in the Northern States, who were anxious for a peaceable separation,"" to whom he had been in hopes that ""great moral weight"" would be given by the recognition of the Southern Confederacy on the part of England and France; and the London Times, echoing the thought, says that ""the best people in the States, and the wisest people here, all look to an amicable separation as the only possible solution of the difficulty, and the only way to heal the breach of feeling."" As to who are the wisest people in England we, of course, would not pretend to dispute with the London Times; and if it says that those are the wisest people there who hold such notions, we must accept it as good authority. But we do not accept with equal submission its decision as to who are ""the best people in the States."" Indeed we are a little at a loss to identify the persons of whom the Times speaks, unless it means JEFF. DAVIS and his fellow traitors. They doubtless ""look to a peaceable separation as the only possible solution of the difficulty,"" although we are inclined to think that Roanoke, and Donelson, and Pea Ridge, and Newborn, and Winchester may have thrown a haze over their bright visions, so that they do not look forward to it quite as confidently as they did. But even they do not look forward to any such thing as likely to ""heal the breach of feeling,"" or at least none of them expresses any such thing.

The pretext is military necessity, and the test scheme is the Reading and Columbia road, to be built over the mountain-tops of Pennsylvania for the purpose of shortening the good inland route already built from New-York to Washington, twenty-five, or as is claimed, thirty miles. We fully exposed the character of this scheme, a day or two since. We stated that the road would cross mountain ridges, at grades of ninety feet to the mile, while the present road passes along the Lebanon valley; and that if one company owned both lines, they would work the long and level one, and abandon the steep one the Government is requested to build, on the score of economy of power and repairs.

The work of printing the Notes began at the close of last week, and will go on rapidly until the entire $150,000,000, authorized by the act, is prepared for circulation. Of this amount, $60,000,000 will be reserved to take the place of the existing issue of July 17 and Feb. 12, as the same is gradually withdrawn from circulation and the new issue substituted. The reason for this change is, that the present United States Notes are made receivable, on their face, for all public dues, including the customs from foreign merchandise now specifically pledged to the prompt payment of the public interest, and a yearly contribution to the sinking fund. As this interest is pledged to be paid exclusively in Gold, and will be so paid, at whatever cost to the Government, provision has been made that the customs duties shall also be paid in Gold.

The swifter witness reported, a day or two ago, a fearful riot, stopping very little short of homicide, as having occurred at Burlington, New Jersey. One SAMUEL AARON, endeavored, we were told, to lecture on the true interpretation of the Constitution, but was promptly interrupted by a portion of his audience, who, to vocal interpolations, presently added the less agreeable and decorous running gloss of addled eggs. From a repeated volley of these, the lecturer took flight. The mob at once pursued him, thirsting for his life; a thirst only not gratified because the friends of the victim adopted the most active measures for his protection. This was a very good story until another spoiled it. Mr. AARON, according to more trustworthy testimony, talked just as long as a lecturer, with any regard to decency and his audience, should talk. Now and again he was interrupted by expressions of dissent; and once, in the course of the prelection, an egg, otherwise than fresh, was misdirected toward him, and a similar missile, still more indifferently aimed, followed his peroration. Two or three lads, armed with such inodorous explosives, may easily throw the most peaceably disposed assemblage into confusion and retreat. But, in the present instance, the life of the speaker was not threatened; and beyond the noisy discussion of the rabble about the doors, there was no marked alarm or confusion.

We think we are able to divine the course she will take. She will abnegate her character as a public armed vessel of the Confederacy, and sail as a merchantman. Indeed, it is understood that the Nashville took out from Beaufort a heavy cargo of cotton; and, sailing in this character, she will of course be hospitably received at Liverpool, Southampton, or wherever she chooses to go. It must be confessed, the device is not wanting in shrewdness. In the first place, her arrival in an English port, after the notoriety she achieved at Southampton, will call attention to her, as giving a double and most flagrant proof of the laxity of the blockade; and Mr. WELLES may have the satisfaction to know that by letting her first go into Beaufort, and then come out, he has done the rebel cause in England more service than GREGORY and all his lists. In the next place, having disposed of her cargo of cotton, she will doubtless reassume her warlike character, and come home lighting up her pathway with a conflagration of other Harvey Birches. We do not think it will stand much against the conscience of her commander, PEGRAM, that this course will make him in form, as he was before in fact a pirate.
