"On Monday night, a serious affray occurred in a drinking saloon, on the corner of Third-avenue and One Hundred and Twenty-ninth-street, between two men named JAMES J. WALL and OWEN PHELAN, which resulted in PHELAN being shot with a pistol. The physicians who attended him, pronounced the wound to be of a very dangerous nature. An investigation of the circumstances connected with the quarrel developed the fact, that a dispute arose between the parties while in the saloon, and that HALL became so exasperated that he made threates of shooting his adversary, unless an apology was made. An officer was then called in, who searched WALL, but no weapon being found, he left. Scarcely liad he done so, when the report of a pistol was heard. He immediately returned, and found PURLAN lying on the floor, with WALL standing over him, with a pistol in his hand. The latter had secreted his pistol during the search, and when the officer was gone, the quarrel was renewed, which resulted in PHELAN being shot in the groin. He was conveyed as soon as possible to Bellevue Hospital, where the physicians in attendance pronounced him to be in a very critical condition, and stated that in all probability he could not recover. WALL was immediately arrested and locked up to await the result of PHELAN's injuries.

That act, and the principle on which it rests, would involve consequences which we cannot disregard in forming an opinion upon it. If we defend it, we admitthe right of the cruiser of any belligerent to visit and search any neutral, and to seize and carry away from her any person or thing which the Captain of that cruiser may deem contraband of war.

The document is generally most mercilessly attacked, and comparisons are drawn between it and the one lately emanating from the traitor JEFF. DAVIS -- much to its disadvantage, the English newspapers contend. The point made of the President's silence relative to the Trent affair is that it is indicative of immediate war -- the exceptions to this view being few. In fact, it appears to be difficult for the English Press to accept any other solution of the Trent difficulty but that of war, in any contingency. The Observer, the Ministerial organ, says that England wishes for peace, but that she will gain by war, as it will enable her to rectify her American frontiers, open the ports of the South, and give a lesson to the United States. Passengers by the Asia also report a rumor that the blocking up of Charleston harbor with stone is likely to lead to difficulty; that England's warlike preparations will continue in view thereof, and that her demands do not end with the surrender of MASON and SLIDELL.

Suspension was inevitable. The Banks contracted to do more than they could perform. The original contract with the Government did not contemplate their conversion from Banks into capitalists, whose whole means are in Government securities. For them to part with their capital in the shape of money would be the most fatal step possible, both for the people and the Government. They are a most important part of the machinery of business. As this is embarrassed or paralyzed, the wealth and consequently the power of the country is weakened or destroyed. We presume that the Secretary of the Treasury fully assents to this proposition.

It opened with a portentous cloud in the Southern sky, then not bigger than a man's hand; but which has since overspread and wrapped as in a pall the whole nation. Last New-Year's Day, only South Carolina had committed herself to dis-union; and almost every one then thought and hoped that the process of disintegration would not go any further; but that the conservative element in the South, and the conciliatory element in the North, would speedily devise some way by which the old fraternal Union would he peacefully maintained, and the Ship of State, compact and strong though storm-beaten, would again pursue her course in placid seas. But beforethe first mouth had passed away, seven States were in the hands of the mutineers, and it seemed for a time almost as though the whole National fabric would tumble to pieces. The second mouth of the year shaped and compacted the revolt, by giving it a Confederated legislature and an Army, and by placing at its head the adroitest of the conspirators. In April the war -- henceforth to become a war of sections and systems -- opened in Charleston Harbor. Then followed the formation of the two great armies -- by this time thirteen rebel States contributing their troops to the one, while twenty-three Union States furnished the soldiers for the other. Since then, for nine dreary months past, the progress of the National arms has been fitful and uncertain -- reverse and victory checquering the record of each week. But at the close of the year of rebellion, we can at least say that the military forces of the nation; on land and sea, have been brought together, and are, apparently, ready to descend effectively upon the nation's foes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""New-Year's Day."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""New-Year's Day."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'New Year', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/747f9f49-be74-5558-9f62-83cd9d7d6ce8,669,nyt://article/747f9f49-be74-5558-9f62-83cd9d7d6ce8,

Editorial on need for postage rate reforms,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/03/archives/rates-of-postagethe-reforms-proposed-and-those-needed.html,Editorial on need for postage rate reforms,"We hope our members of Congress -- and particularly the Post-office Committees of the two Houses -- will read an article in to-day's TIMES, from the pen of Mr. PLINY MILES, the Secretary of the New-York Postal Reform Committee. They will be more than amused at the array of facts given. The expose is complete. Mr. MILES has, of course, gone to the postal law for his figures that give the rates of postage on transient printed matter. We doubt if there are many readers -- even officers of the Post-office -- who would have believed that we had three hundred and twenty ""regular"" rates of postage for transient printed matter on packages under four pounds in weight. In the table of parcels, from one to sixteen ounces, there are eighty different rates. The scale proposed by Mr. MILES, and the Postal Reform Committee, reduces all these to three. These are a fair average of the others, have great convenience and simplicity to recommend them, can be readily remembered, will require no consulting of postal laws to know what they are, will barely need a resort to the weighing scales, and there will be no necessity to examine the packages to see the sort of matter they contain, or the number of pieces comprised. This style of rating postage on printed matter by quarter and half pounds, has been for years in use in England, with the greatest convenience and success. Since its adoption, there has been a vast and rapid increase of all kinds of printed matter in the English mails, affording at the same time great convenience to the public and a good profit to the Department.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rates of Postage--The reforms Proposed and those Needed.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rates of Postage--The reforms Proposed and those Needed.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Postal Service', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/07453e3d-ac58-5bfd-b060-00669a9a2762,766,nyt://article/07453e3d-ac58-5bfd-b060-00669a9a2762,

He reminds his readers that the British possessions in North America are contiguous to the United States on a line of frontier several hundred leagues in length, and which runs from one end of the continent to the other in its widest part, from the territory of British Columbia on the Pacific to the mouth of the St. Lawrence on the Atlantic.

GASSET and RUBALCABA, without one shot having been fired or one blow struck for the honor of Mexico. Havana was, of course, to all outward appearance, in ecstasies of rejoicing at this unlooked-for bloodless, yet important success, particularly as it is entirely a Spanish triumph. The third and last division of the Spanish fleet, which left the harbor of Havana on the 2d ultimo, after fair weather and an easy run, on the 4th joined the divisions that had preceded it. By the 8th, the advanced portion of the fleet anchored off Anton Lizardo, where, on Tuesday, the 10th, it was joined by the remainder of the whole force. After a visit from the French and English consuls, who came off from Vera Cruz on a French steamer, the Spanish commanders held a council of war, and decided to attempt a landing in force on the ensuing day, unless the place should be surrendered upon a formal demand to be made by certain officers detailed for the purpose. A heavy northerly gale delayed the execution of this plan until the 14th, when Gen. URAGA, the Governor of Vera Cruz, expressed his willingness, in the presence of such overwhelming force, to evacuate the place, merely asking twenty-four hours' time to complete his withdrawal. On the 15th he retired with all his troops, leaving the fortress of Ulloa with all its splendid armament and munitions and the ""heroic"" city to the invader. On the 16th, the Spanish officers and, on the 17th, their forces formally landed and took possession amid the acclamations, as their haughty bulletins declare, of the entire people, headed by their local magistrates, Gen. GASSET, at the latest date, had issued proclamations full of promises, had placed the city and environs under martial law, and was reorganizing the Government on a military basis.

Nevertheless there was a goodly number of callers to be seen in the streets, and this branch of New Year's day business was fairly and moderately attended to. It was a common remark, that by far a larger number of families than usual had their card-baskets swing outside, as an indication that no visitors would be received, and among these were many families who have heretofore given special [???] to this occasion. In some cases, houses were closed against visitors on account of recent deaths in the families, others to discourage the custom, but a still larger class, we apprehend, were influenced by economic motives. If outward indications can be relied upon, those who made professional rounds among their friends, did not, to any great extent, reflect discredit upon other similar occasions. They undoubtedly indulged unhesitatingly in partaking of the good things set before them -- particularly of the drinkables. In evidence of this -- we have it from high authority -- every ash barrel in the city was upset last night, and the contents rolled into the street at the mercy of the high wind that prevailed all night. The contractors for cleaning the streets are not in the best of humor to-day, in all probability. Neither are some house-keepers we wot of whose parlort have been sanded by the debris from the ash barrels.",,7,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEW YEAR'S DAY IN BROOKLYN."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""NEW YEAR'S DAY IN BROOKLYN."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'New Year', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3960fdb3-b5ca-5bbd-a3d4-3c045a902bcd,418,nyt://article/3960fdb3-b5ca-5bbd-a3d4-3c045a902bcd,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/03/archives/new-publications.html,,"-- The Memoirs, Letters, and Remains of De Tocqueville, translated from the French by the translator of ""Napoleon's Correspondence,"" are published by TICKNOR FIELDS, in two volumes. The Memory of DE TOCQUEVILLE will ever be reverenced in this country, and even had the work before us no intrinsic merit, the magic of the name of the author of Democracy in America would secure for it an extended sale. But the work possesses an absorbing interest of its own, aside from the associations it revives. It admits us to the domestic circle, and satisfies us that the man who succeeded in exciting our admiration in his public career, is entitled to an affectionate esteem for the virtues which adorned his private life. The charming memoir of BEAUMONT presents DE TOCQUEVILLE to us in a new phase. We behold in him the industrious student, the solicitous friend, the devoted lover and the tender husband, as well as the brilliant and successful author, who attained to those honors in life which are too often reserved to be bestowed only after death. In the man we are enabled to distinguish the traits which so preeminently distinguished the writer. The same clear perceptions of duty and evident determination to adhere rigidly to the line of truth, the same charming candor and earnest good faith are visible alike in his life as in his works. The brief account which M. BEAUMONT gives us of the tour of the two friends on this Continent, when the materials for that master-work of book-making, Democracy in America, were collected, has for us a deep interest. The indefatigability with which DE TOCQUEVILLE pursued his labors, the industry with which he delved where a less discriminating and earnest seeker after knowledge would scarcely have dreamed of digging, the fairness with which his conclusions were formed, and the generosity which made him willing to attach a favorable construction where others would have tortured their ingenuity to produce an entirely different result, incline us to rank him as the very prince of travelers. The majority of our visitors come with a predetermination to find fault -- not to point out the good that exists among us, but to search out and bring into bold relief the bad. So full are they, generally, of this mania for unfavorable mention, that even of a valley where they find abundant grapes they too often return and report nakedness and sterility. It is pleasant to travel with DE TOCQUEVILLE, who journeys in an entirely different spirit, and with whom a spirit of fair inquiry takes the place of the passion for universal condemnation which actuates the great body of travelers in foreign countries.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3ef123fa-9bb3-5e49-9403-410f2fbf9ec2,1098,nyt://article/3ef123fa-9bb3-5e49-9403-410f2fbf9ec2,

But one thing can be said now, which could never have been said before -- that at very many points affairs are almost, if not quite, ready for a grand forward movement. The advance of the main body in Kentucky has been impossible heretofore for the reason that that superb structure, the railroad bridge over Green River, had been destroyed by the rebels, and there was no other means by which our army could cross that stream, so difficult of passage. It was over this bridge, also, by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, that supplies and stores of every kind would necessarily have to be conveyed to our army after it began its Southward march. But the bridge is now repaired, and a large part of our Kentucky army is already on the south side of Green River, while the remainder is pouring over with all possible rapidity. When the whole of the body now on the line of the railroad shall have crossed, it is likely enough that there will be somewhere about sixty-five or seventy-five thousand Western soldiers within five hours' march of the rebel works and the rebel horde at Bowling Green. It is hardly within possibility that, situated as things there are, and with the spirit which pervades that division of the army, a general and a very fierce engagement can now be delayed. It is hardly possible that the army will sit down on the warm side of the river and intrench itself, in Potomac style. Such a policy has been necessary in the latter case; but nothing could be gained, and very much would certainly be lost, if Gen. BUELL were also to adopt it. All the signs in the Western sky will fail if there be not a movement before the current month runs out. Certainly everything there now seems ready.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Readiness for the Advance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Readiness for the Advance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32084532-7201-53c8-a2d8-c321e195da30,833,nyt://article/32084532-7201-53c8-a2d8-c321e195da30,

Officers were stationed at the several ferries leading to New Jersey, and as soon as any suspicious-looking persons arrived in a carriage, if the driver was unable to give a satisfactory answer to the question as to whither he was bound, the inmates of the vehicle were taken into custody and forthwith dispatched to the Station-house.

His conquest of New-Mexico, with a slender force of volunteers, his fertility of resource, and extraordinary energy and enterprise, displayed in suppressing the subsequent rebellion, and in his remarkable Winter campaign against the insurgent Indians, deserve to be recorded as the most shining page of the history of the Mexican war. Among the victories gained by Gen. PRICE, in that war, were the battles of Faos and Rosales, the latter fought against a very superior force, commanded by Don ANGEL FREAS, Governor of Chihuahua, a gentleman who has of late years become well known in the country as a distinguished leader of the Mexican leaders. The same characteristics have marked Gen. PRICE's recent campaign in Missouri; the same originality of conception, energy of action, readiness of invention and audacity of enterprise.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/05/archives/the-demoralization-of-the-rebellion-and-its-cause.html,,"To bear excessive hardships and privations without complaint or demoralization, men must be inspired with a great motive or principle, the vindication of which is abundant compensation for every sacrifice, even death itself. What can be the principle that sustains the rebel army at Manassas, shivering under their clothing of cotton, -- for that of all the dead bodies but two of the rebels found after the fight at Dranesville consisted entirely of cotton, overcoats and all? An army ill fed, badly sheltered, destitute of nearly all the comforts of life, and whose ranks are consequently thinned faster by disease than they could be by a succession of severe engagements in the field? The rebel soldiers are directed to the destruction of a Government which a year or two ago they were as loud in praise of as those now contending in its defence. The Stars and Stripes, the symbol of our nationality, stirred their hearts to a pitch of enthusiasm as intense as it did our own. There is hardly a perceptible cause of personal antipathy. They can be sustained by no motive of personal advantage; for whatever the dreams that were indulged in in the outset, these must, by the inaction in which they have been held, have completely dissipated all expectation of an advance into Northern territory. The greater part of this army has no motive or interest in sustaining Slavery, but really even interest in its destruction. They are not the owners of human chattels whose labor stigmatizes their own industry. The absence of any adequate motive or principle might not prove entirely destructive, if the rebels were as well fed and cared for as are our own soldiers., The lack of occupation would be unfortunate but it might have left the men contented in their ranks. But when this is relieved by no purpose or material comfort, the effect must be immediate and most disastrous. Hence we can readily credit the statement of a Richmond paper, smuggled through by one of the exchanged soldiers in his boot, that the army at Manassas is so thoroughly demoralized that regimental drills are almost entirely abandoned; that the men spend their time at games at cards; that those who have means are offering very large sums for substitutes, and that enlistment of new recruits has almost entirely ceased.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Demoralization of the Rebellion and its Cause.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Demoralization of the Rebellion and its Cause.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a0e2305-d06b-5643-864f-59590fdca0e6,881,nyt://article/2a0e2305-d06b-5643-864f-59590fdca0e6,

The last seen of the child was on the sidewalk in front of the parents' residence, on the day above named. Recently Detective WILSON and officer GOLDEN, of the Sixth Precinct, undertook to ferret out the mystery, and after much labor and time spent in the search, they have at last succeeded in restoring the lost child to its parents. They found the girl in the company of gipsies, near Sing Sing, on the Hudson River. A young woman, named ANN MCCLUSKY, was arrested and brought to this City with the child. ANN states that she took the little girl as she was playing on the sidewalk in front of its parents' house. The accused is only 19 years of age, and appears quite intelligent for a gipsey. Justice CONNOLLY, before whom she was taken yesterday, committed her to await a further examination.

Editorial on war frenzy in Canada,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/05/archives/the-war-frenzy-in-canada.html,Editorial on war frenzy in Canada,"The course of things in Canada since the capture of MASON and SLIDELL has been noticeable. The Canadians received the news of that capture without much disturbance of their equanimity, but the news that England had flown into a rage over it at once stirred up all the Canadian deeps, and ever since then the Canadians have out-heroded Herod in the fierceness of their wrath against us, and their threats of what Canada and England would do for us in case we refused to give the traitors up. This state of mind among them is the natural effect of their colonial relation to England. That makes them look across the water for their fashions and for their public sentiment as well. It is natural that they should do so. We see the same thing in individuals all the time. The boy who goes away from his father's house and sets up in business for himself, always looks back toward home for sympathy, and it takes time as well as strength of character on his part to enable him to judge of affairs in opposition to the views of those to whom he has been accustomed to look for praise or blame. It is the effect of this tendency in human nature that colonies always reflect the tone of the mother country. Canada was not angry at first, because she was uncertain how England was going to take it, and her nearness to us made her share our feelings in the matter; that feeling that the affair was not one of very great consequence, which has been such a marvel to all our friends on the other side of the water, as THURLOW WEED wrote in one of his last letters.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War Frenzy in Canada.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War Frenzy in Canada.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b4b826b-260a-5643-8bd8-ec8fd5bf527b,1165,nyt://article/9b4b826b-260a-5643-8bd8-ec8fd5bf527b,

DAVIS are all in an exceedingly bad way. New-Orleans, whose levees last year at this time were piled mountain-high with the products of the Gulf cotton fields and the produce of the Mississippi Valley -- whose port was crowded with ships of all nations, and whose streets were filled with life and commerce -- is now minus ships, commerce, cotton, corn and cash, and is mentioned only occasionally in connection with some ""grand review"" of seedy old Home Guards, or as being the place after which is named those irrepressible rebel blackguards, the ""New-Orleans Tigers."" Charleston, the next largest city in Secessiondom, is in a still worse plight -- a wretched, charred, ruined old town. Richmond, which is third in size, is the rebel capital; and no more need be said of it. Its own papers describe it as sunk below the level of the most debauched cities in or out of Christendom. Mobile is a commercial city that was. It trembles, too, at the echo of every gun from Fort Pickens. Savannah has run away panic-stricken. There is only Fort Pulaski between it and Tybee.

The recent exchanges of prisoners have  been of a proportion that gives leave to hope that hesitation is at an end in regard to this vital matter. In another column we ...  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/05/archives/common-sense-in-the-exchange-of-prisoners-ers.html,,"print the names of the two hundred and forty Union soldiers lately released and who reached Fortress Monroe on Friday. One can imagine the joy the release brought to our brave fellows who have for long weary months been pining in Southern prisons, -- we may say dungeons -- for Mr. FAULKNER has made known the shameful contrast in the Northern and Southern treatment of captives. It is to be hoped this example will be imitated on a still larger scale. The incubus that long paralyzed action in this matter was the conviction that to consent to an exchange of prisoners would be in some sort a concession of belligerent rights to the rebels. It will be remembered by the readers of this Journal that we showed some weeks ago, in an elaborate historical examination of the mode of treating the question during the Revolution, that there was no difficulty in our realizing all the benefits of an exchange of prisoners, without in the least impugning our sovereign rights over the rebels. We showed that it was freely done by the military chiefs during the War of Independence, when the colonies were rebels against a Power tenacious, if ever nation were, of both the substance and the shadow of its sovereign rights. Since then the subject has been taken up by the Massachusetts Historical Society, and an elaborate memoire prepared thereon by their committee, consisting of three eminent historical and legal scholars -- JARED SPARKS, EDWARD EVERETT and GEORGE T. CURTIS. They arrive at precisely the results we indicated in the article mentioned. They show that exchanging prisoners began almost with the war, it having been effected in the case of those taken on each side at the battle of Lexington. It was, however, done, throughout, by individual arrangements between the commanders, the Royal Government not being willing to come to any general agreement -- as ""it might imply an acknowledgment inconsistent with the claims of the English Government."" And so it continued till the end of the war -- thousands and thousands being exchanged in this informal manner. There can surely be no objection to our conceding as much as Britain was willing to do, at a day when National pride and prerogative reached their amplest development. And as the dictate of common sense in the matter is reinforced by historical analogies and antecedents, it is to be hoped that our Government will see the importance of giving the principle its widest application, and gladden the hearts of thousands of loyal men, restored once more to the protection of the flag in whose defence they lost their liberty.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'COMMON SENSE IN THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.; ERS.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'COMMON SENSE IN THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.; ERS.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fba35910-73f5-5d59-bf64-879271703e4e,439,nyt://article/fba35910-73f5-5d59-bf64-879271703e4e,

Save in exceptional instances unprovided with Winter quarters or fuel, they are exposed to all the unwholesome effects of the keen cold, without other beds than the frozen ground, or other covering than the regulation blanket. Their case is not so desperately hard perhaps, as that of the British army in the [???]. They are at least supplied with abundance of warm clothing, and have a liberal Commissariat, food being the producer of animal if not of artificial heat; but animal heat, unaided by fires and the comforts of a warm bed, escapes too rapidly to permit the resting or sleeping soldier to retain the active vitality necessary to uninterrupted health. The tent invented for use in tropical climates, is a wholly inadequate shelter amid such rigors as the present. Its easy carriage adapts it partially to the wants of an army in active motion, whatever the season; but for armies at rest, and at rest in the most inclement of Winter weather, nothing could be more unsuitable. And what forests or coal-pits, could furnish, heat to a host of two hundred thousand men, situated as is the Army of the Potomac? It is no matter of surprise, therefore, that the individual soldier complains, and finds no consolation in the assurance that the enemy, coming from a region of perpetual Summer, and half-clad, half-fed, and demoralized, must be suffering far more acutely than himself.

The estimates for the present year are $1,564,478 being $233,698 less than was required last year, and there remains unexpended from last year's appropriation a balance of $32,500, which speaks well for the economical manner in which the affairs of the various Bureaus have been managed. The reports of the different Bureaus give in detail the various works which have been commenced or completed during the past year, the greater part of which have heretofore been noticed in the daily prints. In the Bureau of Street improvements, the most important in the Department, a radical change has been effected by advice of the Corporation Counsel. It was formerly supposed to be necessary to advertise in all the Corporation papers for ten days for objections on all resolutions and ordinances of the Common Council, directing any improvement involving any assessment upon property; then the advertising was repeated on inviting proposals for the work, making, with the first advertising of the resolution or ordinance by the Clerk of the Common Council, three times advertising of each matter of improvement, which was a rather expensive programme. Under Mr. BRONSON's opinion, however, the advertisement, in each case, is now only given out with the invitation for proposals, he holding that the ordinance directing the Street Commissioner to advertise past notices is set aside when the Common Council orders the work to be done. Property-owners would do well to remember this, and not hereafter wait to be invited, by special advertisement, to object to any plan of improvement.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""STREET COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""STREET COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/977d6b4c-1eb3-5152-9783-826fe2b179ec,694,nyt://article/977d6b4c-1eb3-5152-9783-826fe2b179ec,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/06/archives/amusements.html,,"A single week of comedies at Mr. WALLACK'S handsome up-town establishment, has wrought so complete a change in the strength and character of the audiences there, that the manager will scarcely need to be urged to continue a style of performance so eminently successful with the classes to whom he looks for support. We do not remember that any sensation piece has ever drawn a succession of houses so thoroughly satisfactory in numbers, or so quick and appreciative in kind. From Monday to Saturday night the theatre was simply taxed to its greatest capacity; hundreds, indeed, were turned from the door. To-night, when BOURGICAULT's ""London Assurance"" is to be played, it is fair to presume that there will be no falling off in this hearty recognition. And it would be wrong if there were, for Mr. WALLACK in these revivals, has done all that lay in his power to secure the approval and patronage of the classes who now rally so generously to his support. The standard comedies have never been seen to greater advantage. The brightness of the theatre; the brilliancy of the costumes; the appropriateness of the scenery; the talent of the artists, and the contagious enthusiasm of the audience, are separate sources of enjoyment which, when combined as they are now, become irresistible. Thus far, GOLDSMITH's comedy ""She Stoops to Conquer,"" has been the most successful of the revivals, -- displaying the talent of the Company without overtaking it, as seemed to us to be the case in the ""School for Scandal."" Both these works have been played twice during the past week, the remaining evenings being filled with Mr. BROUGHAM's five-act farce, called ""Playing with Fire."" A little pardonable managerial latitude is exercised in elevating this curious and most amusing production to the level of a ""standard comedy."" It will be ""standard, "" how ever, so long as the fourth act is played as well as it is by Mr. WALLACK's company, and perhaps no longer. It is certain that neither GOLDSMITH nor SHERIDAN excited the audience to such vociferous demonstrations of delight as did the jovial author of ""Playing with fire.""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dfb864cc-7e1f-5e03-8ee2-643fe600dca4,1571,nyt://article/dfb864cc-7e1f-5e03-8ee2-643fe600dca4,

It would be doing an injustice to the occasion to speak with any closeness of the merits of the pictures exhibited. Art touches society with a gloved hand and seeks a recognition not a criticism. Still, if the times were better, it is probable that we should have had some larger works to testify to the industry of our artists; being bad, it is reasonable that they should be economical in size as in price. The collection was a small one. There were old faces on the walls, too, but this circumstance did not detract from the hearty recognition which old friends have a right to expect at this time of year. Pleasant social chat, tinged with art and flavored with music made the hours fly fast. Among the exhibitors whose works attracted the most attention were EASTMAN JOHNSON, (Card-Players;) GIGNOUX, (An Autumnal Sunset, unpretending, and a study, but thoroughly effective and purely American in tone;) EDWIN WHITE, CHURCH, WHITTREDGE, GIFFORD, (a little gem, called the Bronx River;) CROPSY, (A Study;) HUBBARD, YEWELL, JAMES M.

Yesterday morning the fight took place. The scene of the encounter was fixed at Weehawken, N.J. At an early hour scores of the votaries of the P.R. wended their way, plodding along through the heavy snow-storm on foot and in various descriptions of vehicles. At least two hundred persons were present on the occasion -- amongst them a large number of the leading ""fancy men about town."" They reached the ground by various routes -- some even going by cars to Newark and thence by conveyance to Weehawken, in order to effectually elude the police. The heavy snow-storm rendered it difficult to select a spot for the fight, but at length, after a little surveying, a place was chosen and the snow removed, the distances measured, the ring formed, and the other preparations made. At a little past 8 o'clock the two principals, with their seconds and referee, drove up in separate carriages, and at six minutes past 9 o'clock ELLIOTT threw his cap into the ring and then followed it, accompanied by his seconds, CLARK and WOODS. WINKIE also threw his cap and entered the ring with his seconds, KIT BURNES and ----- ROACH. ELLIOTT won the choice of corners, after which the men were attired in fighting costume by their respective seconds. MARTIN BUTLER was selected referee, and at 9:20 o'clock called the combatants to face each other. In response to the summons, both men walked to the centre of the ring, looking as agreeable and well pleased as though they were going on a jaunt into the rural districts in Summer. The snow fell in large flakes thick and fast, but neither appeared to notice it.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PRIZE-FIGHT AT WEEHAWKEN.; Ninety-five Rounds Fought Between Elliott and Winkie, in Two Hours and Ten Minutes The Battle Drawn Horrible Scene.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PRIZE-FIGHT AT WEEHAWKEN.; Ninety-five Rounds Fought Between Elliott and Winkie, in Two Hours and Ten Minutes The Battle Drawn Horrible Scene.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7877b84e-67cf-5f84-8523-ab8cdd9ce310,529,nyt://article/7877b84e-67cf-5f84-8523-ab8cdd9ce310,
"-- The advices we receive from Europe are of the most satisfactory character. Confidence in a pacific solution of the Trent affair seems to have become general, and to have diffused an universal sense of relief. The markets are, in such matters, the critical test of public opinion. When consols rise it is because the apprehension of war declines; and, in the present instance, if cotton advances it is because the prospect of obtaining new supplies through a forcible opening of the rebel ports disappears.

Confidence in a pacific solution of the Trent affair seems to have become general, and to have diffused an universal sense of relief. The markets are, in such matters, the critical test of public opinion. When consols rise it is because the apprehension of war declines; and, in the present instance, if cotton advances it is because the prospect of obtaining new supplies through a forcible opening of the rebel ports disappears.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/07/archives/another-success-in-western-virginia.html,,"The Union force in Western Virginia shows no disposition to hibernate after the usual pattern in its Winter quarters. Since the departure of Gen. ROSECRANS to Wheeling, and the transfer of the bulk of his recent army to the column of Gen. BUELL, there have been two principal camps maintained by the National troops -- one under Gen. COX, at Charleston, on the Kanawha; the other under Gen. MILROY, at Cheat Mountain, with lines extended toward Elk Water and Huttonsville. Gen. COX has been relieved by the departure of Gen. FLOYD into Tennessee of any enemy within striking distance. But in front of Gen. MILROY, at Monterey and Huntersville, the main body of what was recently Gen. LEE's command is quartered, and with these the Union leader finds occasion to refresh and keep alive the war temper of his force. It was only on the 13th ult. that MILROY sought out the enemy at Camp Alleghany, in Pocahontas County, inflicted a frightful loss of life and other damage upon him, and retired in safety to his quarters. A similar expedition, with even better results, is now reported by telegraph. At Huntersville among the Alleghanies, the rebels had established a depot of army stores guarded by some seven hundred and fifty men. Against this post, Gen. MILROY dispatched a force of nearly the same strength, which after a sharp and curt contest, obliged the enemy to retire, with the loss of eighty in killed and wounded, and the sacrifice of the stores valued at $80,000, and of much greater value doubtless to the Union troops in their distant mountain quarters, now almost inaccessible from the Ohio side. The success was brilliant and important, in this, that it adds proof to proof of the superiority of our soldiers on a fair field over the adversary, and it goes to intimidate the scattered Secessionists of that quarter, who, without such frequent demonstration of Federal strength in their midst, would hasten to organize, and commit every imaginable excess upon their loyal neighbors. As it is, the spirit of rebellion, within the bounds of the new State of Kanawha, is practically extinguished.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANOTHER SUCCESS IN WESTERN VIRGINIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANOTHER SUCCESS IN WESTERN VIRGINIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a2108af0-4593-5a7f-be58-e1b2380795cd,357,nyt://article/a2108af0-4593-5a7f-be58-e1b2380795cd,

"-- The disposition of Congress to enter just now upon the discussion of the Trent question is to be profoundly regretted. The issue is still pending. Negotiation may have much to adjust and much to explain away before that peace which the surrender was to purchase shall be secured; and all such ill-judged speeches as that delivered yesterday in the House by Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts, will only tend to perplex and, perhaps, defeat a pacific accommodation. Had it emanated from VALLANDIGHAM or other declared sympathizer with rebellion, the object of the outburst would have been obvious, and must have rendered it innoxious. But Mr. THOMAS comes from the ""Quincey"" district of Massachusetts, is regarded as a conservative, as well as a loyal supporter of the Government; and professes to be chiefly animated by a desire to suppress the rebellion. He even believes that peace with foreign nations should be sought at any price, rather than that aim should be postponed. But when he speaks of a sacrifice of principle submitted to by the Administration, of a humiliation inflicted by England, of a cause abandoned in the support of which we were sure of the sympathies of mankind. Mr. THOMAS shows an utter ignorance of the settled policy of this Government on international questions, or a disposition to pander to that misguided popular sentiment, which he represents as existing in Massachusetts. We have surrendered SLIDELL and MASON, not merely because England demanded them, but because the procedure of Capt. WILKES was not formally correct, and because to have retained them would have been to justify England in adherence to a class of maritime laws, which for half a century the American Government has sought to abrogate. And, so far from persistence in holding the captives securing us the sympathy of the world in the resulting contest, our Government had express assurances that France, our ancient ally, could not sustain us, and the evidence of the entire European Press, that our cause was held to be unjust and indefensible. Every Continental Power in Europe had manifested its eagerness to accept the American doctrine, that ""free flags make free ships;"" while England alone dissented; and while we may be prepared to turn our backs upon that doctrine, it is certainly too much to expect of the other Powers of the world to abandon at once their obvious interests and their consistency, simply to follow our capricious lead. Had we accepted the search of the Trent as a cause of war, we should have become the champions of an obsolete and tyrannical principle, hateful to mankind, and should have presented to the world the spectacle of a nation justly punished for inconsistency.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/08/archives/the-trent-imbroglio-in-congress.html,,"-- The disposition of Congress to enter just now upon the discussion of the Trent question is to be profoundly regretted.

He said this was the thirteenth annual sale that had taken place under his auspices, and notwithstanding the troublesome times the church was still in a prosperous condition. The first pew was struck off to Mr. DENNIS at $100 premium, and the next at $75 premium. When 100 pews had been sold, the premiums ran down to $20, where they remained some time. All of the pews except thirty-two were sold. The pews sold were appraised at $12,050. On these the premiums amounted to $6,323, or about half the amount of premiums received last year.

When we say this, it will be taken for granted, that everything in the way of scenery, costumes and appointments was complete and satisfactory. The rapidity with which Mr. WALLACK succeeds in laying these massive works before the public, is only equaled by the curious excellence that marks each revival -- seeming in fact to separate it from its predecessors by a new condition of merit. It is a pity that the same cannot be said of the plays themselves. Only in the spirit of a past generation can a work like ""Love for Love"" win the enthusiastic approval of criticism. We have outgrown the kind of love that it deals with, and our morals, if they have not improved, are at least amenable to a sense of decency. The licentiousness of CONGREVE and others is a reproach to, and blemish on, the brilliant epoch that produced them. The few works that time has spared reflect this pruriency only to make us wonder why time has spared them. Were it not for judicious pruning, even ""Love for Love"" would not be tolerated. Mr. WALLACK's version preserves all the better parts, and illustrates the author's wit and felicity of expression. Beyond this it would be difficult to find matter for praise.

RATZ, and that upon this charge they were for a short time confined in the Tombs. Two days after they were imprisoned, he says the lawyer POGLIANA called upon complainant, in the Tombs, and desired to be engaged to defend him. He was, says the complainant, accordingly employed, and paid the sum of $10 as a retaining fee, which was all the money then demanded. A few days subsequent, the man of the law called again and asked for $25, as he said, to give to Justice CONNOLLY, who would then surrender the papers upon, which he and his wife were held. This was also paid. In the afternoon of the same day, he called again and obtained $15 for preparing the bail bond. On the 20th of September he asked and received the sum of $20. This money the lawyer said was for the purpose of giving, to the District-Attorney, to induce him to surrender the prosecution papers. On the 30th of the same month, he induced the complainant, BONAVENTURA, to pay him an additional $20, which it was said was to be paid to the clerks in the District-Attorney's office for copying papers. The further sum of $20 was obtained from him on the 14th of October; this amount was for the bondsmen. The next day he demanded and obtained an additional $20 for the Judges' clerks, and two or three days subsequently he came to the poor man, who by this time was nearly destitute, and demanded the further sum of $50, to square up all arrearages in the different offices, and at the same time promising to release him from all the consequences of his arrest, as above mentioned. The man said he had but $15, and this he gave to the attorney; and in order to make up the balance, his wife's earrings, brooch, and the only bed they had in the house were delivered over. The complaint further alleges that the only thing that the lawyer has done for him was to draw a bail bond, and that he was discharged in a few days after being put in the Tombs.

"-- We have recently received, through the kindness of a friend at Arica, Peru, a quantity of petrified Indian eyes, taken from the Indian burying-grounds in that neighborhood, which are probably as great a curiosity in their way as has ever come to light. The ball of the eye is exceedingly perfect, displaying the pupil and other parts very distinctly. It is apparently of a hard, horny substance, and peels off in thin transparent flakes.

A temporary organization was effected, by the election of WM. COIT, Esq. as Chairman, and S. ALPHEUS SMITH as Secretary. The room was crowded with delegates and others, and it was quite evident that there was to be an exciting time, and in this there was no disappointment. The old antagonistic feeling existing between the ""Union"" and ""Straight"" Republicans, burned more fiercely than even before the last Fall election, and it only required a very little thing to bring this feeling out in full force -- and the occasion for its exercise was not long wanting. After some preliminary wrangling about minor matters, credentials were received when it was found there were contested seats in the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Wards and protests against the admission of delegates from the First and Twelfth Wards. The Chairman decided that all persons claiming to be delegates must be admitted to seats who presented prima facie evidence that they had been legally elected. Under this ruling the First Ward was passed over, but when the Twelfth Ward was reached, the admission of the accredited delegates was most strenuously opposed. The Chairman refused to put test motions because the Committee was not properly organized, and a scene of excitement followed which beggars all description. Motion upon motion was made by different parties, each claiming the right to have their motion put to the Committee. Several impromptu fights were suppressed by the timely interference of the cooler members. Finally the Chairman decided to modify his decision so far as to put the motions made, -- only those delegates whose names had been called having permission to vote thereon. This was accepted and the business of the Committee was proceeded with in comparative order. Subsequently two delegates from the First Ward, Messrs. CARLIN and EAMES, were admitted by a vote of the Committee and also the delegates from the Twelfth Ward. At a later hour the excitement subsided, and the members of the Committee appeared to be on as good terms as ever, when the following named Committee on Credentials was appointed, to whom was referred all the contested seats and protests: Messrs. Winslow, Bradley, Nodyne, Reeve, Hathaway, Lindsay and Donovan.

In the main purpose of the bill, viz., the forfeiting all the property of those who shall be engaged in the rebellion, we heartily concur. Hitherto it has been the interest of every inhabitant of the seceding States to join and aid the rebellion, because if he did not, his property was swept away from him at once by the rebels, while if he did they would not seize it, neither would the United States forfeit it, if they should prove victorious. The passage of this bill will tend to equalize matters. The scales will no longer be weighted to favor rebellion, and any one who hereafter joins the rebels can have no cause to complain, if he loses all his property in punishment. The main purpose of the bill, as we said, we heartily approve. Some of its provisions, however, need more careful arrangement and some modification.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Forfeiture of Rebel Property.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Forfeiture of Rebel Property.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe7af116-8fb5-5f13-b349-6d334a0fa024,951,nyt://article/fe7af116-8fb5-5f13-b349-6d334a0fa024,

The physician in spite of himself is beaten by his wife, is beaten by other people, (of course we mean MOLIERE's physician,) is laughed at for his ignorance: puts the liver on the left side, and the heart on the right: justifying himself by the famous reply ""we have changed all that"" -- and is the butt, the laughing-stock and the cat's-paw of the play. In all these points he is beaten by his modern imitator. But on one he is entirely eclipsed by his rival. The former, living in a coarse age, is tolerably decent, tolerably clean; the latter, living in these decorous days is intolerably -- other-wise. For, proud of the newly acquired knowledge which is so much to his taste, he goes into particulars, and drags into his editorial columns, and explains to the best of his ability, those phrases which are to other people entirely without meaning and without interest, and which in other journals are left undisturbed in advertising columns, resting there upon the responsibility of professional advertisers, and to be seen only by those for whom they have interest, or to whom the remedies which they promise are necessary.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Physician in Spite of Himself.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Physician in Spite of Himself.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/501e7d3a-3f6b-5c28-ba15-3f67ee8e712a,442,nyt://article/501e7d3a-3f6b-5c28-ba15-3f67ee8e712a,

If the criticism were directed merely against unwise or untimely talk, no sensible man but would approve the sentence; but when it is urged that the people's representatives shall abrogate their proper legislative functions, and confine themselves to voting appropriations and imposing taxes, it is difficult to resist the conviction that the clamor proceeds either from a pitiful subserviency, or from a very inadequate conception of what Congress is. Were the duty of the National Legislature limited to blindly voting budgets, a far simpler contrivance than the complex machinery of our representative system would answer the purpose. But we hardly think the American people are prepared to accept any such theory; and, on the contrary, they will continue to expect, that those whom they have sent to Washington as their agents shall exercise to the full their right to give or to withhold, to censure or commend those set in the high places of civil or military trust -- shrinking from neither the duties nor the responsibilities of their position.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Congress as a Talking Body.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Congress as a Talking Body.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d3345627-b1ec-566a-a181-6cd4e0fd5360,560,nyt://article/d3345627-b1ec-566a-a181-6cd4e0fd5360,

On the second day after, the United States gunboat Flambeau made its appearance in the harbor, sent thither for the special purpose of intercepting the Gladiator. There they both lie now -- the Gladiator afraid to venture out, and the Flambeau not daring to lay hands on her; and there they are likely to remain until Great Britain enters the ring, when not only will the Gladiator be convoyed over to a Confederate port, but the Flambeau be picked up and brought along with her.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM THE REBEL STATES.; THE STEAMSHIP GLADIATOR.

It is to the circumstance of our having propounded a milder sort of interrogation in this line, that the agonies of our sister city are at the present moment due.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/10/archives/congress-yesterday.html,,"In the Senate, the bill to promote the efficiency of the Dead Letter Office was reported from the Post-Office Committee. It provides that all dead letters shall, when possible, be returned to the writers. Its consideration was postponed until to-day. The Judiciary Committee reported in favor of the expulsion of Senator JOHNSON, of Missouri. Various bills relating to the organization of the army, were reported from committees, but were not acted upon. A petition was presented from citizens of Pennsylvania, reflecting upon the Secretaries of War and the Navy, for the appointment of Messrs. CUMMINGS and MORGAN to make contracts. Mr. WADE introduced his bill to punish frauds upon the Treasury. It provides for fine and imprisonment. It was referred. The House resolution relating to bonded coffee, tea and sugar, was passed, 23 to 15. The correspondence relating to the Trent affair was then taken up, and Mr. SUMNER, of Massachusetts, delivered his expected speech upon the subject, which will be found reported in full in this morning's TIMES. After Mr. SUMNER concluded, the bill providing for twenty mail-clad gunboats was taken up, the question being, on the proposed amendment to substitute the President for the Secretary of the Navy as the person to obtain their construction -- thus implying a censure on Secretary WELLES. The debate upon the proposition was continued at considerable length, and it was finally thrown out by the adoption of a resolution, offered by Mr. WILSON of Massachusetts, making a direct inquiry of Secretary WELLES as to his employment of GEORGE B. MORGAN, and the amount of compensation paid him.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONGRESS YESTERDAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CONGRESS YESTERDAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b944d89-8bde-5a24-8258-f987b0213f33,324,nyt://article/9b944d89-8bde-5a24-8258-f987b0213f33,

Mr. BOURCICAULT has converted the ""Cricket on the Hearth"" into a delightful drama full of spirited effects, strong contrasts, and seasonable lessons of geniality. The other dramatist, in trying to do the same thing by the ""Christmas Carol,"" failed in every one of these requirements, succeeding only in hacking and hewing his material into a shapeless and meaningless mass, wearisome to him who was not familiar with the source whence it was chipped, and irritating to all else. But why dwell on a matter that has been disposed of by the public? BOURCICAULT'S piece remains, and the other has been consigned to that limbo whence good scenery cannot rescue it. Coming as a lesson of life, such a fact would be heeded, but as an experience of the stage it will have no significance. It would be vain to hope that good plays will take precedence of bad ones -- useless to suggest that a man should understand his business ere he attempts to practice it. The stage gravitates naturally to mediocrity, and managers think no more of a literary man than they do of a bootblack. It is only by stern examples, such as the absolute failure of one piece and the complete success of another, that they will be brought to a sense of their dependent condition, -- and now that the mania for tinseled flummery and local bosh -- called burlesque -- has subsided, these examples will be frequent.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a59cc40c-8878-5ef3-b80c-fbd605b42630,1237,nyt://article/a59cc40c-8878-5ef3-b80c-fbd605b42630,

The impression that the mother country seeks a quarrel with her over-grown child, has taken deep root in the American mind; and if the search of the West India packet was not the cause of a justifiable anger, and the resentment appropriate to national honor grossly outraged, but rather the signal for the explosion of a politic passion and the pretext of a war, for which a pretext only was wanting, we may reasonably watch with solicitude the effect of our unexpected moderation. If the wrath of John Bull was genuine, our prompt concession must not only extinguish it, but excite the regret always realized by the generous when they have been guilty of hasty injustice. If not genuine, the American amend will be received grudgingly and scrutinized critically and disdainfully, and other causes of discord will not long be wanting.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England on a Peace Footing.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England on a Peace Footing.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1ebc238a-ef6d-523f-aa19-e2b22ffca272,821,nyt://article/1ebc238a-ef6d-523f-aa19-e2b22ffca272,

Editorial attacks Herald editorial policies,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/11/archives/the-herald-appreciated-in-europe.html,Editorial attacks Herald editorial policies,"Some of the English newspapers have at last begun to perceive the true character of the New-York Herald. That it was vulgar, indecent, mendacious, and, above all, ridiculous, they found out long ago; for eyes, and common decency, and common sense were all that were required to make that discovery. But the moral status of the paper, the place which it holds in the estimation of the community, its own readers included, they have only just begun to apprehend. The notion is at last dawning upon their minds that such a monstrous and absurd performance as daily issues from the Herald office, cannot possibly have any influence with creatures of a higher grade of intelligence than gorillas, or be justly regarded as expressing the sentiment of human beings who have sufficient coherence of thought and consistency of action to be allowed to remain on the outside of a lunatic asylum. Seeing this, they yet stand puzzled over the facts that this queer paper has a considerable circulation, and that it is regarded as the cause of certain effects -- always evil, be it observed. At their puzzlement out comes the mountebank's trumpet, and we hear the long and well-known blast, followed by the query. ""Who then can doubt the tremendous influence of the Herald?"" A query, indeed, sufficiently impudent and ridiculous to excite a stare and a laugh on this side of the water, where the querist is well known, and which would be entirely unworthy of serious notice, were it not for the uninformed people upon whom it might possibly impose abroad.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Herald Appreciated in Europe.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Herald Appreciated in Europe.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68ca0e9a-8781-53bb-8244-ed19665c56b1,1018,nyt://article/68ca0e9a-8781-53bb-8244-ed19665c56b1,

There has been a ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/11/archives/privateering-a-failure.html,,"-- There has been a long lull in privateering. The piratical act of the Nashville is the last thing of the kind, and that was an affair as profitless to JEFF. DAVIS as it was dastardly. The Sumter, instead of being the terror of the seas, which she was for a week or two, is now reduced to being the skulk of the West India Isles. It is all she can do to keep out of the way of her pursuers. The small pirate craft which for a while pounced out with impunity from Bull's Bay, Savannah, the Gulf Coast, or the North Carolina sounds, and seized our unsuspecting traders as they passed by, have all been quiet lately. They are neither able to get out from their dens nor to get in again, and are leisurely rotting by the Southern docks; while those who manned them have become disheartened and disgusted at their ill-luck. That fearful Confederate fleet, which has been anchored in James River for half a year, waiting for a chance to run out and devour Northern ships, must be nearly sunk with its weight of barnacles, and the jolly tars who man it must be lean with waiting. The pirate steamboats which JEFF. DAVIS commissioned to prey on the commerce of the inland rivers, the Tennessee and the Mississippi, have captured, in the gross, one scow. In fact, it must be acknowledged all round, that Confederate privateering is not much of a success. If the Sumter and the Nashville were nabbed -- and it is not creditable to us that they have not been nabbed -- the whole system of Confederate piracy might be considered as effectually disposed of. The ravages of the privateers in the Mediterranean, the China Seas, and the Pacific, have thus far existed only as dark and ominous prophecies in rebel newspapers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PRIVATEERING A FAILURE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PRIVATEERING A FAILURE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d312655-0044-503c-976d-53b1fbd42b07,449,nyt://article/9d312655-0044-503c-976d-53b1fbd42b07,

The bill in regard to the administration of criminal justice in the District of Columbia, relating especially to the incarceration of fugitive slaves, was made the special order for Tuesday next. The bill providing for the construction of mail-clad gunboats was not considered -- an answer from the Secretary of the Navy to the resolution adopted on Thursday being waited for. The case of Mr. STARKE, of Oregon, appointed in place of Col. BAKER, was taken up, and after considerable debate, it was decided that his credentials must go to the Judiciary Committee before he could be admitted to a seat -- only eleven Senators opposing such action. The bill for the organization of the Signal Department of the army was passed. The bill relating to the appointment of Sutlers in the army was then taken up, and debated until the adjournment, which was until Monday.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONGRESS YESTERDAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CONGRESS YESTERDAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a836e24b-eb97-51e5-801f-ad5799e7cd34,427,nyt://article/a836e24b-eb97-51e5-801f-ad5799e7cd34,

Editorial on medical practice in US Army,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/11/archives/homoeopathy-in-the-army.html,Editorial on medical practice in US Army,"There is quite a commotion just now among the doctors in regard to homoeopathic practice in the army. An effort is making in Congress to give this school of practitioners the same privileges, and the same right to position, in the army, as any other medical school or sect. It is claimed that the Government has no more right to create an established form of medicine than an established form of religion; and that the civil and military authorities are as incapable of deciding the scientific questions involved in the dispute between homoeopathy and allopathy, as they would have been of deciding the great theological controversy between the Homoousians and the Homoiousians. Therefore, as a regiment may choose a priest, a minister, or a rabbi, from any one of a hundred sects, to cure its souls, it is argued that it should be permitted, with equal freedom, to say whether, in physic, it will follow the doctrines and practice of Hippocrates, or Hahnemann, or Priessnitz. The homoeopathists are besieging Congress for a definition of their constitutional rights in this respect; and a bill, we believe, is to be at once introduced putting them on an equal footing in the army with any other medical school. They also claim the right of establishing a military homoeopathic hospital in Washington, that the merits of the rival systems may be tested before the world on a large scale. They are greatly encouraged lately in their efforts for official recognition from the fact that when, a few weeks ago, Gen. MCCLELLAN's charger was indisposed, he submitted to homoeopathic treatment, and the General, himself, in his recent sickness, has had homoeopathic advice.

"Colt, (Col) Samuel; Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/11/archives/obituary.html,"Colt, (Col) Samuel; Dies","-- Col. Samuel Colt, who died at Hartford, Ct., on Thursday, was born in that city, on July 19, 1814. Entering a factory belonging to his father when ten years old, he worked faithfully four years, and then was sent away to school at Amherst, Mass. He managed to run away from this establishment, and shipped as a boy before the mast on a ship bound to the East Indies. On his return from this voyage, he served a short apprenticeship in a factory at Ware, Mass., but getting weary of this manner of life, assumed the name of Dr. Coult, and traveled through the United States and British Provinces, lecturing on Chemistry. The money thus earned enabled him to perfect his famous revolver, of which he had conceived the idea when on the way to Calcutta, and in 1835, when but twenty-one years of age, he took out his first patent for revolving fire-arms. A company was formed in 1835, with a capital of $300,000, to manufacture these arms, but there was at first so little demand for them that it was obliged to suspend in 1842, and when the Mexican war broke out they had gone so entirely out of use that Col. Colt found it necessary to make a new model before he could fill Government orders. Since that time the business has increased so rapidly that the manufactory in Hartford, which has cost altogether over $1,000,000, has been found insufficient to fully supply the demand, although the arms are also made both in England and in Russia, at establishments erected under Col. Colt's supervision. Col. Colt's ingenuity was not confined to the perfection of fire-arms. He has invented a submarine battery of great power and efficiency, and as early as 1843 laid and operated a submarine cable from Coney Island and Fire Island to this City, and from the mouth of the harbor to the Merchants' Exchange. Although overwhelmed with business cares, Col. Colt has always manifested the greatest interest in the welfare of his employes, having erected for them remarkably tasteful and convenient places of residence, and established a public hall, where they have the privilege of attending courses of lectures and concerts.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Colt, Samuel', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DEATHS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ebb5554e-06ef-5b0a-85b6-75549703dc4a,837,nyt://article/ebb5554e-06ef-5b0a-85b6-75549703dc4a,

It was never very clearly established whether the author was sought for in order to be made the recipient of a aurel wreath, or simply that a morbid anxiety to know who could have written so very stupid a book might be satisfied. Any way, the authorship has never been avowed; and in this fact we discover in the author an evidence of genius which we failed to find in the book. Another novel, The Sutherlands, ""by the author of Rutledge,"" is printed by CARLETON. Some profound critic remarks that ""this second effort of 'the author of Rutledge' is in all respects equal to the first."" And such is our candid opinion, -- it is certainly no better -- it could not well be worse. Rutledge was a remarkably weak imitation of Jane Eyre, possessing all the faults of that remarkable book without one trace of its abounding vigor and weird interest. The Sutherlands is a book coined from the same metal as Rutledge, but cast in a different mold. It has the same hollow ring, the same galvanic glitter. There is a weak straining after effect -- a lamentable ""falling short"" of reaching any. As to plot, if the book has any, we have failed to discover it. Scenes and episodes seem to be only introduced that the author may be delivered of a deluge of words, which lie like water on the brain. We question whether so many words with so few ideas were ever before -- except in the memorable instance of Rutledge -- gathered together in the same space. Occasional horrors are crowded in to awake the morbid appetite which is supposed to lie dormant in the minds of most readers, but they are so unusual, so far removed in their ghastiliness from anything approaching life, that a weary feeling of disgust is the only emotion excited. It will be well, we think, for the author to preserve anonymousness to all time, lost a deputation from the reading world take summary vengeance for all they have been called upon to endure.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/27a5d37e-dbf4-50f4-a1e5-c6e47d8045d4,1238,nyt://article/27a5d37e-dbf4-50f4-a1e5-c6e47d8045d4,

But there is a recent English case of persecution for conscience' sake that should admonish them to look nearer home for food for their indignation. Rev. Dr. WILLIAMS, one of the writers of ""Essays and Reviews,"" is now being tried for heresy before the Court of Arches in England. The gentleman's contribution to that now famous volume is simply an exposition of some of the more recent German rationalistic principles of criticism with respect to prophecy, and are stated not so much as his own views, as those held by the late Baron BUNSEN, the noble-hearted leader of vital Protestantism in Germany. And yet he is hauled up and tried for heresy! When the National authority of the United States was put forth to suppress the publication of inflammatory [???] to create sedition, it was a measure of public safety imperatively demanded by the voice of all loyal men. It is reserved for England in the Nineteenth Century to give us the example of a public prosecution for a difference of speculative opinion on a matter of faith.

RODINA NUTT, a thrifty and highly respected farmer of the above town Special attention has been paid to the education of the pigmy Commodore. He is not only a good. English scholar, but is also tolerably proficient in the French language. He amuses himself in farming, especially in driving the team, having quite a passion for horses. He is also fond of hunting and fishing, and is a bright and graceful specimen of minute humanity, being symmetrically formed, and a most polite and refined gentleman. In stature he is inconceivably small. All other dwarfs tower as giants by his side. Gen. TOM THUMB, with whom Mr. BARNUM created such a furor in Europe some years ago, stands thirteen inches higher than Commodore NUTT, ""boots and all."" Liberal overtures have been made by our first showmen for the privilege of exhibiting the little Commodore to the public, but his parents, and indeed the little NUTT himself, have decided objections to his being made ""a show"" of. Gen. TOM THUMB called on the little man a short time since. It is said that after looking down upon him for some time, Gen. TOM exclaimed, ""Well, Commodore NUTT, I must confess you are a hard nut to crack!"" Mr. BARNUM, with his usual enterprise, has gone to Manchester for the purpose of making overtures to the Commodore, with a view of exhibiting him at his Museum.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/72547e3b-c732-582e-a7e1-68015ecbcf35,888,nyt://article/72547e3b-c732-582e-a7e1-68015ecbcf35,

Editorial on Union's commercial relations with Great Britain; Editorial on Unions commercial relations with Great Britain,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/12/archives/our-commercial-relations-with-england.html,Editorial on Union's commercial relations with Great Britain; Editorial on Unions commercial relations with Great Britain,"It appears from the accounts issued by the Board of Trade, in London, that the total quantity of raw cotton imported into British ports during the eleven months ending Nov. 30, was 10,432,099 cwt., being but 677,875 cwt. less than in the corresponding portion of the preceding year, and 1,375,978 cwt. more than in that of 1859. If we exclude from the account all but American cotton, the proportions differ somewhat more, the imports of this staple amounting to 7,312,940 cwt., which was 1,606,129 cwt. less than in 1860, and 173,065 cwt. more than in 1859. The imports of American cotton diminished but little until October, when, of 487,636 cwt. of raw cotton imported, only 3,630 cwt. were of American growth. In November, the quantity fell to 286 cwt., the total imports being 328,576 cwt. The stock of all kinds is greater now than at this time last year, but the Indian supply alone has increased. Of the total quantity imported during the eleven months, 2,600,280 cwt. was obtained from India, 316,917 cwt. from Egypt, 129,512 cwt. from Brazil, and 72,450 cwt. from all the rest of the world. These latter small supplies from acknowledged sources show, however, a disposition to increase the supplies derived therefrom, amounting to 5,378 cwt. in October, against 3,754 cwt. in the corresponding period of the preceding year, and to 18,672 cwt. in November, against 10,001 cwt. The advance in price is shown by the fact that the value of the cotton imported during the ten months ended Oct. 31, is computed at £34,718,348, being £3,755,963 more than for the corresponding portion of 1860, though the quantity imported was less. The exportation of raw cotton from Liverpool does not appear to have been so large as was feared, the total exports of the eleven months being 2,528,824 cwt., against 2,160,197 cwt. in the corresponding period of the preceding year. In November, only 111,885 cwt. were exported, against 136,925 cwt. The diminished consumption is shown by the diminution of the declared value of the manufactures, exclusive of hose, sewing-thread, lace, and other small wares, from £36,102,681 to £33,416,527, as compared with the corresponding eleven months of 1860. Two-thirds of the total decrease is due to the diminished exportations to the United States. The computed real value of the cotton yarn exported during the eleven months was £8,730,223, against £9,069,052; and the lesser branches of manufacture, above referred to, and which could add about a million and a quarter sterling to the total value of the exports, have fallen off in about the same proportion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Commercial Relations with England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Commercial Relations with England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8547aa90-5bd8-5f7f-a696-7dbfd73d73f4,1120,nyt://article/8547aa90-5bd8-5f7f-a696-7dbfd73d73f4,

editorial on coalition and Monroe Doctrine,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/12/archives/the-triple-coalition-and-the-monroe-doctrine.html,editorial on coalition and Monroe Doctrine,"The formidable force sent against Mexico by the ""combined Powers"" has excited the surprise of every one on this side of the Atlantic. A fleet numbering fifty-six vessels of war, carrying 1,453 guns, and manned by 27,931 sailors, marines and soldiers, seems to Americans an armada entirely over-proportioned to the accomplishment of the professed objects of the expedition. To exact reparation for alleged grievances from a State so feeble as Mexico, which has neither navy nor regular army, that vast armament was assuredly not needed. The fact is, however that the professed objects of the allies are not the only and most important objects which they have in view. They aim at something more worthy of their power and prestige than redressing their subjects' wrongs, or oppressing a poor, distracted and impotent Republic. Those latter designs, indeed, are not yet officially and openly avowed, but the candor of Mr. THOMAS COLLEY GRATTAN, in his recent pamphlet on the Trent affair, and the propriety of recognizing the Southern Confederacy, gives us very plainly to understand that they are actually entertained. That writer does not hesitate to affirm that the chastisement of ""miserable Mexico"" is merely the ""nominal purpose"" of the nations whose fleets and armies are now beleaguering her borders, and seizing on her ports. If, however, the chastisement of Mexico is only the ""nominal purpose"" of the coalition, what is its real purpose?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Triple Coalition and the Monroe Doctrine.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Triple Coalition and the Monroe Doctrine.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a1947261-e471-5c86-9065-0f0cee81ab78,673,nyt://article/a1947261-e471-5c86-9065-0f0cee81ab78,

The force of good example was never more happily illustrated than in the change which has suddenly overspread the heretofore distorted face of the drama and converted it once more into something pleasant to behold. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/13/archives/amusements.html,,"The force of good example was never more happily illustrated than in the change which has suddenly overspread the heretofore distorted face of the drama and converted it once more into something pleasant to behold. It is but a few weeks -- we might almost say days -- since the affiickes at all the theatres announced some repetition of a worn-out, sensational or spectacular drama. From Mr. WALLACK's hand, some up-town establishment to BARNUM's down-town American Museum, there was a glut of show pieces many of the concert-rooms, by the way, competing' and not unsuccessfully, with our beat theatres in this specialty of a vicious existence. It was a rage, and like all other rages, doomed speedily to exhaust itself. The managers, too, were careful to labor for their own destruction. They perceived that gorgeous scenery, and utterly inconsequential set-tableaux caught the eye of the public, and brought down the house with applause. Hence they became worshipers of the paint-pot, and in every piece presented at least one picture full of broad glaring effects and sensual dreaminess, but having no more relation to the plot than BARNUM's cartoon in Broadway has to the life of the merchant who passes it in an omnibus Not for a moment did it occur to their minds that something more than the eye had to be pleased; that after a while, these brilliant shams would pall on the appetite, and people would begin to talk about the intense stupidity of the dialogue they had listened to. On the contrary, what little literary merit the pieces possessed at the outset was speedily discarded, as superfluous. It was trifling enough, in all conscience but better than the vulgar clap-trap which took its place, and owed its origin to the gagging propensities of the actors. How long this state of affairs would have lasted, it is impossible to say. The public had probably wearied of it when Mr. WALLACK conceived the Idea of reviving the old comedies. Certain it is, that from the moment of doing so he has wrought a change in things theatrical, and been the recipient of the heartiest patronage. His beautiful theatre has been crowded with the best audiences we have ever seen in a place of amusement, and this, too, despite the unfavorable weather which has prevailed for a couple of weeks. The public rejoices like a school, boy relieved of his task. It is a good thing for a community when it can choose its recreation; a bad thing, when it is compelled to put up with that which neither improves the mind nor the heart. There is now no longer a doubt that given this choice, a New-York audience will always prefer what is healthful to that which is meretricious.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1a66108e-f350-5c1d-9fb7-2a02c0a82fa6,1560,nyt://article/1a66108e-f350-5c1d-9fb7-2a02c0a82fa6,

editorial on ways to finance war now being discussed in Washington,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/13/archives/crisis-of-the-treasury.html,editorial on ways to finance war now being discussed in Washington,"It is greatly to be desired that the questions of Finance pending at Washington should be promptly determined. The Ways of conducting the Treasury, under the recent suspension of Specie payments at Bank, are immediately necessary -- pressingly so -- if the Public Finances are not to fall into utter confusion. The Means for making, such Ways easy and creditable are in one sense doubly important, but demand no crude or very hasty adjustment. A simple resolution that Congress will, at an early day, from the highest sense of public duly and pursuant to the known readiness of this whole loyal People to bear the burden, impose all-sufficient taxes to support the National credit, so as to render the Public Stocks created and to be created by the Loan Bills of Congress, not only negotiable, but every way desirable above all other income securities, would be sufficient, for the moment, to give direction to the preliminary question of Currency. Whatever shape or forms this question may be made to assume, to relieve the existing and painfully growing suspense, whether Exchequer Bills, as proposed by some banking authorities, having a few years to run, and bearing a moderate rate of interest, or United States Treasury Notes, to be made a legal tender, not alone for the convenience of the Treasury, in the absence of Specie payments at Bank, but in all the transactions of business between the People of the different States and of the same State, they will all undoubtedly be made fundable into the Public Stocks of the United States.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/13/archives/brooklyn-news-laying-the-cornerstone-of-a-jewish-synagogue-trowel.html,,"The corner-stone of a place of public worship for the first Jewish Synagogue ever organized in this city, was laid yesterday, with appropriate exercises. The congregation is known as ""Baith Israel,"" of which Rev. JOEL ALEXANDER is the Rabbi. Six years ago it was organized by sixteen persons, and a place for worship was secured at No. 155 Atlantic-street, where it has remained from that time until the present, gradually increasing in numbers, usefulness and prosperity, until now, even in these times when the whole financial world is deranged, and the country involved in war, the members feel warranted in supplying the necessity which exists of increased accommodations for public worship. Although the people of this faith are not very numerous in our midst, nevertheless this synagogue -- not to be behind the fashion -- has had its little dissensions, which resulted in a split, and the organization of a new synagogue known as ""Bethlehem,"" in December last, now occupying a portion of Grenada Hall, Myrtle-avenue, as a place of worship. Hut the dissension in this case is likely to prove to be the seed of the church in this City, for where we have had only one society heretofore there exists two, and each is vieing with the other in the path of usefulness. There are also three or four Synagogues in the Eastern District, neither of which have as yet found it expedient to erect a house of their own. The Synagogue of Baith Israel, being the first to lay a corner stone in this City, there was much curiosity felt to witness the ceremony, and, notwithstanding the very disagreeable weather and that the ground was covered with snow and water, there was a very large attendance of the believers in the faith of Abraham, and a still larger attendance of others attracted to the spot by curiosity. But as the ritual of the Jewish Church does not specially provide for the laying of cornerstones, there is nothing very peculiar about the exercise, save and except the presentation of a silver trowel to the person selected to put the stone in place. The recipient of this distinguished honor -- for such it is considered -- is usually a leading and active man in the synagogue, who by his efforts und liberality in its behalf has been particularly identified with its success. The individual selected furnishes the corner-stone, and the congregation present to him the trowel, which is ever kept as a sacred heir-loom in the receiver's family.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Laying the Corner-Stone of a Jewish Synagogue.

The arrogance and precipitancy of Spain will most probably work out her salvation. Spain's invasion of Mexico and seizure of Vera Cruz were, it seems, unauthorized acts, of which the other Powers were ignorant, and will hardly approve. The terms of the Convention of London do not sanction this Spanish aggression. By that instrument, indeed, France and England admitted Spain to participate in the expedition against Mexico, to aid and assist them in putting the affairs of that ill-fated Republic in order, but the Allies, when conferring on Spain this honor, merely intended that she should act in concert with themselves, and had no idea of permitting her to intervene alone, and before they were ready to cooperate in the enterprise. The proper course for Spain to have taken, therefore, was to assemble her armament at the place of rendezvous, and there await the arrival of her confederates. The truth, however, is that the Court of Madrid regarded the intervention of France and England in Mexico with the greatest aversion, and was determined, if possible, to get the start of them. Accordingly the commander of the naval and military force at Havana received secret instructions to proceed forthwith to Mexico and commence operations; and so, giving the slip to their allies, the Spaniards sailed away to their destination, and took possession of Vera Cruz. When intelligence of this audacious aggression first reached us, though surprised at finding Spain alone in her glory, and unsupported by the other Powers, we yet fancied she was merely carrying out the programme agreed on, and that, however outrageous her conduct seemed, all was still right. But, as we have already intimated, the last European mail has brought us information on the subject which leads us to conclude that the contrary is the case. The invasion of Mexico by Spain had excited astonishment in France and England. The two nations were quite unprepared for it, and the Patrie goes so far as to affirm that the commander of the Spanish armada must have acted without orders from home. ""Marshal SERRANO, at his departure from Havana,"" says this Parisian paper, ""could not have known of the last arrangements made in London. He could not have received the dispatches from his Government informing him of the common cooperation of the three Powers."" But is it probable that the Spanish commander ventured on so important a step without instructions? And the tenor of those instructions may be judged from the result.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spain in Mexico The Combined Powers not Combined.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spain in Mexico The Combined Powers not Combined.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/65197ca1-2685-52a6-8f3b-9d9e970379ba,621,nyt://article/65197ca1-2685-52a6-8f3b-9d9e970379ba,

"There are all sorts of speculations as to the destination of the Burnside Naval Expedition, which is now riding in Hampton Roads. The rebels speculate, the soldiers of the expedition speculate, the country editors speculate, and almost every person has a private theory on the subject. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/13/archives/the-burnside-expedition.html,,"-- There are all sorts of speculations as to the destination of the Burnside Naval Expedition, which is now riding in Hampton Roads. The rebels speculate, the soldiers of the expedition speculate, the country editors speculate, and almost every person has a private theory on the subject. Nearly everybody agrees that it will not go further South than North Carolina, and a good many people think it will not go even as far away as that. The rebel MAGRUDER's opinion is that it is undoubtedly going up the James River, and ""on to Richmond ""by that route; and in expectation of it he has retreated to Yorktown, and has got everything ready for another retreat. The Richmond Examiner has reliable advices that the expedition is bound up the York river, as that is a far more eligible route to the rebel capital than by the James, and as it would be an easier way to get in the rear of the rebel right wing on the Potomac. It is given out by others that it is neither of these Virginia rivers by which the expedition will operate; but by a third stream, still further east, the Rappahannock, and that the design is to take in the rear the rebel batteries and rebel forces on the Potomac, and threaten the railroad connections of the rebel army with Richmond. A fourth theory sends the expedition up the Potomac, to take these same batteries in front, and to put an end to the river blockade which has so long and so disgracefully interrupted our communication with the National Capital. Other speculators look further South than either of the points mentioned, and judge from a number of significant indications that not Richmond nor the rebel right, but the city of Norfolk, is the point to be assaulted by a combined land and naval force; and that the expedition will sail to Cape Hatteras, enter Pamlico Sound, skirt along the inland water way, and the forces will take Norfolk in the rear. This theory is popular among the rebels; so they have fortified Roanoke Island and other points on the North Carolina Sounds, and dispatched the heroic Gov. HENRY A. WISE to take command of the rebel forces on the mainland in that vicinity. The rebels have many other theories on the subject, and almost every coast town from Norfolk to Galveston fancies that it is surely the point which, above all others, is most likely to be assailed. The likelihood is, however, that beside our high military authorities, there is no one in the country who can say certainly whither the expedition is bound, excepting JEFF. DAVIS and his immediate counselors; and probably even they are somewhat unsettled on the subject. Let every one in the meantime, look up his geography, and form his theory; but do not, make any wagers that the expedition will certainly go to either of the points which the rebels and the knowing ones so confidently name. The secret of the expedition's destination will be published in the TIMES, as soon as it effects a landing.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BURNSIDE EXPEDITION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BURNSIDE EXPEDITION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/834a9601-7f29-5e42-8609-df73edb77132,517,nyt://article/834a9601-7f29-5e42-8609-df73edb77132,

These serve the purpose of a cartridge box, and the rifle is charged by a partial revolution of the stock, which is quickly reversed, and the gun is ready for firing.

Americans understand too well the position of the Liberal Party in Eng land, to include them in their reproaches. They have watched with admiration and deep sympathy, the persevering efforts of a few leaders during many years, struggling against every kind of obloquy and the prejudices of caste, to enlarge the domain of popular rights. They have felt for the silent multitudes behind them, who through their mouthpieces, were protesting against the pride and oppression of the aristocracy. They have beheld and applauded the victories of peace, gained by these noble men, more glorious than the most brilliant conquests won by the cannon and the bayonet. It is not too much to say that COBDEN and BRIGHT are names more familiar and more beloved, among the millions of America, than those of any European statesmen. Every intelligent American citizen sees that those men, and their great party of the middle and working classes in West Britain, are contending for precisely the same cause which this Nation has represented in the world -- the cause of the Many against the Few -- Democracy against Aristocracy. Not, of course, that the English Liberal Party ever calls for, or perhaps desires, a republican form of Government; but the principles of extended suffrage, of popular education, of opposition to an aristocracy and a State Church, and of peaceful relations among nations, belong to that policy which the people in all countries must inevitably support. We have accordingly all appreciated the difficulty in which a superficial view of our struggle, and ad captandum arguments drawn from our civil war, would place the English Liberals. While we knew that so far from Democracy being the cause of our troubles, it was precisely because we had admitted a false aristocratic principle into our policy -- the power of a slaveholding class -- that we were now in danger; yet we could understand with what force the aristocratic organs would employ the American troubles against English Reform.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'English and American Democracy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'English and American Democracy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a62bceba-c115-53b7-94a1-9664ca1b5aa6,1013,nyt://article/a62bceba-c115-53b7-94a1-9664ca1b5aa6,

Its misrepresentations of Northern sentiment, and falsehoods as to the purposes of Mr. LINCOLN in assuming the Presidential office, did more than anything else to render possible the plans of the Southern conspirators last Winter; and had it not been checked by a popular demonstration, it would have urged the surrender of the entire Union to its confederates in treason. Its efforts in this direction having failed, it turned them elsewhere. A war with England would bring that country into our domestic quarrels, as an ally with the Herald's Southern friends, and accordingly through the Summer and Fall the Herald devoted itself to inflaming the resentment of our transatlantic brethren, as it before inflamed the resentment of the South. Now there is this peculiarity about the status of the Herald. Where it is understood, it is utterly destitute of influence, insomuch that the men it assails are at once assured of popular confidence, and the measures it advocates are instantly killed. But at the South, distant and unenlightened, its lies pass for probabilities, and in England, yet more distant, for absolute truths. So that, misled by its recklessness, the British public had come to believe the American people to be actuated by the bitterest impulses of hostility, only to be quieted by a war which the act of Commodore WILKES was designed to inaugurate. This result of the Herald's diabolical spirit of mischief-making and covert zeal in behalf of the rebel enterprise, was only balked by the wise and salutary readiness of our Government to make that concession to justice and English resentment, which must satisfy the British public how false were the representations of the Herald, and how really solicitous for peace is the great body of our people.

One of the most important of these is the care of the slaves who will be set free, for they are free the moment the tie by which they are held -- force -- is broken. In cases where their owners have been seeking the destruction of the nation, it is clear that we are not going to return the escaped slaves to their former condition, Other questions of hardly less importance will come up, such as the disposition that is to be made of the property of rebels. All these questions cannot be too speedily ventilated, for great reflection and care must be had in dealing with subjects so novel and intricate as the management and disposition that is to be made of the enfranchised blacks, and the subversion of the social status at the South, so far as the conduct of the rebels has made such change inevitable. We are much gratified, consequently, with the commencement, made by Mr. BLAIR in his report to the House, as Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs. Mr. BLAIR in proposes a very simple method, whereby to vest in the United Slates the estates of the rebels, by enacting that the tax assessed by Congress at its extraordinary session, upon the several States, shall be deemed, in law, to be assessed on the several parcels of real estates in the States or Districts in rebellion; and where the same cannot be collected by the civil process, that the neglect or failure for sixty days to pay such tax shall vest the lands upon which it is assessed in the United Stales, it is provided, however, that any loyal citizen, may, within two years, upon proofs of his loyalty, become reinvested in his estate.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Blair's Confisoation Bill."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Blair's Confisoation Bill."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/123047a8-1abc-5946-9b24-d3161b19daef,1229,nyt://article/123047a8-1abc-5946-9b24-d3161b19daef,

It has been evident that the general policy of the Administration, and the opinions of the secretary of War, were irreconcilable. Mr. CAMERON, representing in the Cabinet the least radical of all the loyal States, has from the first been satisfied of the identity of the rebellion with Slavery, and has been persuaded that the suppression of both is essential to the restoration of the Union and the future peace of the Republic. These views he has lost no occasion of advocating. He has embodied them in his instructions to commanding officers, and it is well known that a clause in which they found practical application was, by the immediate influence of the President, expunged from the Annual Report submitted in December. That he should sacrifice his views, or that a Cabinet could cohere with such radical differences of opinion, was not to be expected. Mr. LINCOLN, born in a slaveholding community, and familiar with the institution, believes that if may be perpetuated without hazard to the Union. He considers the Border States entitled to every possible guarantee for the industrial system they have inherited, and is willing to test the possibility of restoring the status in quo with the least possible disturbance to the interests of those States. But Mr. CAMERON saw in Slavery the root of all difficulty. He regarded National restoration as impossible, until the slaveholders had been compelled to retire to that subordinate place to which alone their inadequate scheme of labor entitled them; and he doubted the propriety of prosecuting the war without striking some effective blow at its well-known source. Such contrarieties of opinion could not conveniently exist in the same counsels, and hence the necessity of separation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Change in the Cabinet Resignation of Secretary Cameron.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Change in the Cabinet Resignation of Secretary Cameron.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/702a33b1-fdf5-5138-b8c0-ce1502fd8b7b,1021,nyt://article/702a33b1-fdf5-5138-b8c0-ce1502fd8b7b,

"The receipts for duty at the Custom-house during, the past few weeks have been rather larger, and business a little mom brisk, than heretofore. The work continues to be heavy in the Warehouse Department, and the stock of goods in store is continually diminishing, which shows conclusively that the importation of foreign goods is not commensurate with the public demand therefor. The stock of goods still remaining in bond, however, is much larger than it often is at this season of the year, notwithstanding the gradual withdrawal of the oil entries. Many of the goods imported toward the close of last year, when the importation of articles of foreign manufacture was heavy, have not been withdrawn as yet. At that time large quantities of dry goods were purchased from abroad or consigned by foreign manufacturers to their agent here, hot the threatening aspeal of our national affairs made their sale at that time doubtful, and as the three years' warehousing law was then in force, the importers and consignees preferred to leave them in bond, and withdraw from time to time what they needed. This will account for the receipts from this department, which are very large considering the state of trade and the small amount received for goods on which the duty is paid on arrival. In September, 1861, the amount paid for duty on goods, immediately on arrival, amounted to $1,642,382; from goods withdrawn from warehouse. $736,500; In September, 1860, the duty paid on goods, immediately on arrival, was;$3,039,000; that paid on goods withdrawn from warehouse was $909,000. From these figures, it will be seen that the proportion of duty received from bonded goods in September, 1861, was considerably greater than that in 1800. In October, the proportion was still greater. The change in the class of goods imported is noticeable. Last year, at this time, the importation was chiefly of dry goods and sugar. This year, the Importation of the former is insignificant compared with that of the same time last year. The war has changed the character of the goods brought here amazingly. Dining the month of November the following goods were brought here, namely: About 10,000 tons of salt, in sacks or in bulk, comprised in between thirty and forty different invoices; about 2,200,000 pounds of rice, coming from the East by way of Liverpool, and a considerable quantity of opium, say 14,000 pounds. The above articles have been very good ones for speculators to operate in since the war broke out; more especially is this true of rice, for which there has been an active demand, and from the usual supply of which we have been cut off by the blockade of the Southern ports and the non-intercourse between the Northern and Southern States. It will be seen that the quantity of salt imported from Liverpool has been large, notwithstanding the levy of a duty of over 100 per cent, on the invoice value. The duty on opium is quite low compared with that imposed on most other articles. $1 per pound being only about 30 per cent, on the value. Large quantities of all the articles mentioned above have been placed in the bonded warehouses.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/14/archives/customhouse-affairs-business-at-the-customhouse-during-the-past.html,,"The receipts for duty at the Custom-house during, the past few weeks have been rather larger, and business a little mom brisk, than heretofore.

In September, 1861, the amount paid for duty on goods, immediately on arrival, amounted to $1,642,382; from goods withdrawn from warehouse. $736,500; In September, 1860, the duty paid on goods, immediately on arrival, was;$3,039,000; that paid on goods withdrawn from warehouse was $909,000. From these figures, it will be seen that the proportion of duty received from bonded goods in September, 1861, was considerably greater than that in 1800. In October, the proportion was still greater. The change in the class of goods imported is noticeable. Last year, at this time, the importation was chiefly of dry goods and sugar. This year, the Importation of the former is insignificant compared with that of the same time last year. The war has changed the character of the goods brought here amazingly. Dining the month of November the following goods were brought here, namely: About 10,000 tons of salt, in sacks or in bulk, comprised in between thirty and forty different invoices; about 2,200,000 pounds of rice, coming from the East by way of Liverpool, and a considerable quantity of opium, say 14,000 pounds. The above articles have been very good ones for speculators to operate in since the war broke out; more especially is this true of rice, for which there has been an active demand, and from the usual supply of which we have been cut off by the blockade of the Southern ports and the non-intercourse between the Northern and Southern States. It will be seen that the quantity of salt imported from Liverpool has been large, notwithstanding the levy of a duty of over 100 per cent, on the invoice value. The duty on opium is quite low compared with that imposed on most other articles. $1 per pound being only about 30 per cent, on the value. Large quantities of all the articles mentioned above have been placed in the bonded warehouses.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CUSTOM-HOUSE AFFAIRS.; Business at the Custom-House During the Past Month-Increased Importation of Rice, Salt and Opium The Warehousing System The Will of the Merchants The Letter of Collector Barney on the Subject History of the System Extracts from the British Law Advantages of the System.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CUSTOM-HOUSE AFFAIRS.; Business at the Custom-House During the Past Month-Increased Importation of Rice, Salt and Opium The Warehousing System The Will of the Merchants The Letter of Collector Barney on the Subject History of the System Extracts from the British Law Advantages of the System.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4547902-153f-5927-93ad-807e54d59f17,952,nyt://article/a4547902-153f-5927-93ad-807e54d59f17,

"On another page of this morning's issue will be found a report in full of the speech made last evening at the Cooper Institute by Mr. WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON on ""The Abolitionist and their Relations to the War."" ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/15/archives/mr-garrisons-address.html,,"On another page of this morning's issue will be found a report in full of the speech made last evening at the Cooper Institute by Mr. WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON on ""The Abolitionist and their Relations to the War."" The subject is an interesting one, and certainly could not have had a more authoritative expounder than the Boston Nestor of Abolitionism. The magnificent uprising of the North in defence of the Constitution and the Union against the Slaveholders' rebellion had the effect to swallow up this like all other secondary issues, and for the time being Mr. GARRISON and his co-workers have carefully refrained from any movement tending to mar the unity of sentiment and action in the great cause. Many of his friends, and followers, it is known, have, under the eaching of the times, greatly changed their ultra views -- the touch of a terrible reality dissipating their theoretic abstractions. Even the organ of Mr. ARRISON himself, the Liberator, has lately struck its ancient motto of the Constitution as ""A covenant with death arid an agreement with hell."" Mr. GARRISON explains the position of his party, however, by saying that ""Death and hell have now seceded"" from the Constitution ! and this characteristically bizarre vindication, he thinks, leaves their position perfectly logical. In declaring the Government to be wholly in the right, and the Secessionists wholly in the wrong, as relates to the precise, issue between the parties, the Abolitionists abate no jot nor tittle of their testimony against a Constitution and Union with Slavery. ""That Constitution,"" he says, ""could it be enforced, as hitherto, would still be a 'covenant with death,' and that Union, could it be maintained, would still be 'an agreement with hell.'"" And hence, argues Mr. GARRISON, the need for immediate and universal emancipation.

According to accounts brought down from the interior by Sir CHARLES WYKE, the English Minister, who arrived at Vera Cruz on the 24th, the Mexicans are making immense preparations to oppose the progress of the allies into the interior. JUAEEZ had issued a temperate proclamation, calling on all parties to unite to repel the invasion, and his call had been almost universally responded to.

Observations of nation-wide press,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/15/archives/the-rebel-gen-jackson.html,Observations of nation-wide press,"In the year 1835 this JACKSON was one of the Freshman Class, entering Vale College -- then a youth about sixteen or seventeen years of age. This class was a large one, numbering 135 -- larger, in fact, than any which at that time had entered the college. It continued a due proportion of Southern students. At that day all the classes contained more students from the South than in these later years. One-fourth, perhaps, of the whole number were from the Slave States. I think it would have been generally conceded that this JACKSON was the ablest Southern student in the class, and indeed in the college. The writer above quoted has described him correctly -- ""a fiery Georgian of great ability."" He could not have been characterized, while in college, by any words more fitting. High-spirited, a little haughty and overbearing, but on the whole not uncompanionable -- a vigorous thinker -- an accomplished scholar -- a ready writer and debater, he was regarded as one of the lights of, the class of 139. The reference to his literary abilities, in the passage which we have quoted, does not overstate the matter. Some pieces of his poetry have from time to time strayed through our Northern papers, and have been much admired. He figured with considerable notoriety in the Mexican war. He was for a time United States Minister to Austria. He has held for some years the office of Judge in the Courts of Georgia, and has been generally a very prominent man in that part of the country ever since his studies were closed.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL, GEN.

Newbern is situated at the confluence of the Neuse and the Trent, near the head of a sound or extended bay, which itself empties into Pamlico Sound, the command of both of the principal entrances to which -- Hatteras and Ocracoke Inlets -- has been secured by the National forces. From Newbern, the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad stretches through about fifty-five or sixty miles of level country to Goldsborough, which is upon the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, -- the direct line of communication between Eastern Virginia and the Southern seaboard cities; and from Goldsborough it is but forty-eight miles by the. North Carolina Railroad to Raleigh, the Capital of that State, but which possesses at least equal importance as the point through which the secondary and indirect communication of the Southern seaboard States with Eastern Virginia is kept up.

"The public has a quiet confidence in the successful issue of the Burnside expedition. Whatever may be its work, and wherever it may be going, no one seems to doubt its safely reaching its destination, or that it will unfailingly achieve the purpose for which it has been sent. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/16/archives/the-burnside-expedition.html,,"The public has a quiet confidence in the successful issue of the Burnside expedition. Whatever may be its work, and wherever it may be going, no one seems to doubt its safely reaching its destination, or that it will unfailingly achieve the purpose for which it has been sent. This proceeds partly from confidence in the men who lead the expedition, partly from the fact that every one believes it will strike in an unanticipated and unguarded quarter, and partly from the success of each of the three coast wise expeditions that have preceded this one. Every one seems to believe, too, that more important results will follow this expedition than either of the others. Though the previous expeditions were successes so far as regards effecting a landing, they are generally regarded as failures in respect of real results. When the first expedition landed on Cape Hatteras, it was popularly believed that a heavy column of troops would be immediately thrown on the mainland of North Carolina, which would penetrate inland and relieve that State, and then attack the main body of the rebels in the rear. But half a year has elapsed without any such result. So with BUTLER's Ship Island expedition. It was only to rendezvous for the day on that island sand-hill, and very soon it was to push on to New-Orleans or Mobile -- which, up to this moment, there is no appearance of its doing. The Port Royal Expedition was to give us possession of Charleston and Savannah a week or a fortnight after it landed -- which it has not yet done. In all this, of course, the public was a little too sanguine in its anticipations, and is now much too depreciatory in its criticism. These expeditions have accomplished a great deal, which will appear clearly enough when the history of the rise and fall of this rebellion comes to be written. But we suspect that BURNSIDE's expedition has work to do whose importance will be more immediately apparent, and whose results will be speedier and more evidently visible than in the case of the other expeditions. The rebels at Manassas have only two direct and effective lines of railroad connecting with the States of the South. One of these lines, that through East Tennessee, is in imminent danger of capture by our victorious column in Eastern Kentucky, joined to our forces near the Cumberland River. It may be, if, as is generally understood, the Burnside column is to operate at some point between Hatteras and Cape Lookout, that the other of these railroad lines, which is within easy striking distance, is about to be seized, and thereby the rebels be compelled either to leave Manassas or to starve. If such be the design, it is to be hoped that our troops will not squat down for any length of time on the coast, and thereby give the rebels a chance to make Goldsboro', which is the point necessary for us to capture, another impregnable Manassas.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Burnside Expedition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Burnside Expedition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a2047e7-abe0-5334-98a6-343b29c5ce47,503,nyt://article/2a2047e7-abe0-5334-98a6-343b29c5ce47,

Chase on financing war,"The telegraph brings us what are called the results of the various conferences among themselves, and with the Secretary of the Treasury, of certain representatives of the Boston and Philadelphia Banks and three or four Bank gentlemen from this City. These results differ from the original programme urged by the same parties upon the Secretary and the Committee of Ways and Means, in recognizing the $50,000,000 of United States Notes already in circulation as worthy of the support and countenance of the Banks, which they promise shall be given, by their free receipt and payment at Bank. They also differ from the earlier conferences on Saturday and Monday last, in leaving out of view the opinions, consent or purposes of the Committee of Ways and Means, which we take to be significant of the present unwillingness of the Committee to forego their own bills on the subject. Nor do we find, from the wording of the dispatch, that the results now arrived at have the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury. The whole matter, we presume, amounts to nothing more than the financial conclusions which should be arrived at by the Government, in the opinion of a party of gentlemen presumed to be conversant with the subject, and by no means indifferent to their own interests as money-lenders, any more than to the policy of the Government as the great borrower.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Bankers at the Capitol.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Bankers at the Capitol.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Banks and Banking', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'CONGRESS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6cd0b11d-2d85-5e33-8ad7-4cc11380b961,483,nyt://article/6cd0b11d-2d85-5e33-8ad7-4cc11380b961,

HUTCHINGS, with Sergeant BRACKETT and a platoon of men, made a descent upon a gambling-house situated at No. 17 Ann-street. It was kept by PATERIK HUGHES, who with ten others, were taken into custody, and at a late hour yesterday afternoon they were all brought before Justice CONNOLLY at the Tombs. HUGHES, the proprietor, and a man named EARLE, were held to bail in $500 each for trial. The following named persons, who were arrested, were held to bail in $100 each: Eagan Norris, Henry Williams, Montgomery Gillie, Thomas Garles, John Haley, Jacob Depeau, Wm. Riley, Geo. Allen, Dewitt Smith and George Doyle. GEORGE ALLEN is said to be a Deputy-Sheriff, and he had the badge of office on at the time of the arrests. While HUGHES, the proprietor of the establishment, was in custody, he made an effort to seize the money, which the police had taken from the establishment, namely $45. He got a part of it in his possession, but he was immediately discovered by Sergeant BRACKETT, who prevented him from taking the remainder. When the arrests were made, the gamblers were engaged in a game of ""faro."" They had their table directly over a trap-door in the floor of the room. MORRISSEY was around, watching the proceedings of the police, and when the parties were taken into Court, he stated that, if he could have reached the place a few moments before he did, the police would have found nothing to seize. The property taken by the officers at the time of the arrests consisted of faro tables, cards, dealing boxes, and $45 in money, all of which were taken to Court and deposited with the Justice. The police state that there is a contrivance in the place, No. 17 Ann-street, whereby all the gambling implements may be made to disappear by means of a trap-door whenever there is the slightest warning that the authorities are about to enter. Captain HUTCHINGS so managed it as to elude the suspicion of those who were watching for the officers. The books of the gambling-house were also seized. By these it appears that the net proceeds for the month of December last were $2,154. For the month of January thus far, that is to the 13th inst., it was $268. The amount of the winnings and losses was put down in the books each day, and from this book it appears that on Sundays during the month of December there was more received than upon any other day of the week.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Gambling-house Broken Up.; LARGE NUMBER OF ARRESTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Gambling-house Broken Up.; LARGE NUMBER OF ARRESTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c6d5f3de-0719-51ab-9be9-7df3c87fc140,425,nyt://article/c6d5f3de-0719-51ab-9be9-7df3c87fc140,

A bill for the preservation of the Atlantic fisheries was reported from the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The joint resolution to promote the efficiency of the troops serving in Kansas was taken up, and debated at considerable length. Mr. SAULSBURY, of Delaware, was very much afraid that it was intended to arm the negroes, and declared that the adoption of the resolution would extinguish the last hope of Union. Mr. LANE explained that no such intention was entertained, but that negroes would be used in building fortifications. The resolution was not disposed of. The numerous bills in reference to the confiscation of the property of rebels, referred to the Judiciary Committee, were all reported back, with one as a substitute, which provides for confiscating the property and freeing the slaves of rebels.

Those could never have existed, unless the conditions on which they are based had been supplied by man. The natural routes of commerce, the great rivers of the Continet, had their outlets in inhospitable climes, and far distant from the central portion of the Atlantic slope, which was better fitted than any other of the Continent for commercial and manufacturing enterprise, and as the seat of a dense populating, and at the same time most conveniently placed in reference to the Old World. The proposition set before our people, consequently, was to correct this oversight of nature; to recast a Continent, and adapt it to their convenience and wants. Nature had taken good care, however, that the task should not be too ardous to discourage the attempt, by the slight elevation she gave to the interior of the Continent, and in the gentle and uniform slopes of its great plains. In its centre were the great lakes, so nicely poised as to give almost equal choice of outlet, either into the Gulf of Mexico, Hudson's Bay, or the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A low ridge, of eight feet in elevation, is the only barrier between them and the Mississippi, which was undoubtedly at one time their outlet. The waters of the two mingled in times of flood, allowing the barks of the natives to pass from one to the other. On the North, a similar means of communication exists between the lakes and Hudson's Bay, although the dividing ridge is somewhat higher. The great depression in the Continent, however, in ascending from the Gulf, is to be found in the Valley of the Mississippi and the Red River of the North, whose waters also mingle, so that, at certain periods of the year, boats pass from one to the other. But neither the inhospitable shores of Hudson's Bay, or the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or the insalubrious Delta of the Mississippi, were adapted to become the seals of a people excelling alike in agriculture, commerce, and the mechanic arts, which require for their development the temperate and bracing climates of the Middle and Northern States, beneath whose soil Providence has accumulated in the greatest profusion the two prime agencies in modern civilization -- iron and coal.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INTERNAL COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES.; A Paper Read before the American Geographical and Statistical Society, by Henry S.Poor, Esq., a Member of the Society.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INTERNAL COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES.; A Paper Read before the American Geographical and Statistical Society, by Henry S.Poor, Esq., a Member of the Society.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8fbdf49e-7874-5398-b8c1-abc2fafa6d94,4669,nyt://article/8fbdf49e-7874-5398-b8c1-abc2fafa6d94,

He said it enforced the doctrine of THOMAS JEFFERSON, who said ""It is a wise rule, and should be fundamental in a Government disposed to cherish its credit, and at the same time to restrain the use of it within the limits of its faculties, never to borrow a dollar without laying a tax in the same instant for paying the interest annually, and the principle within a given time, and to consider that tax as pledged to the creditors on the public faith. On such a pledge as this, sacredly observed, a Government may always command, on a reasonable interest, all the fundable money of its citizens, whilst the necessity of an equivalent tax, is a salutary warning to them, and to their constituents, against oppression, bankruptcy and its inevitable consequence -- revolution.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Geographical and Statistical Society.; THE REPORT OF THE COUNCIL UPON TAXATION AND FINANCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Geographical and Statistical Society.; THE REPORT OF THE COUNCIL UPON TAXATION AND FINANCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9592636b-cb3a-5632-9529-19f9b454d5d6,459,nyt://article/9592636b-cb3a-5632-9529-19f9b454d5d6,
"The agency of Mr. GEORGE D. MORGAN in the purchase of vessels for the Navy Department has been made the subject of inquiry by both Houses of Congress, and in the Senate, soon after the beginning of the ession, a resolution was adopted, calling upon the Secretary of the Navy for information in regard to the facts, which were apparently these: Directly after the opening of the war it became obvious that very large additions would have to be made to the Navy by selections and purchases among the commercial marine. The Navy as well as the Army has Boards of experts qualified to transact its details of business, and the established course for the Secretary of the Navy was evidently to assign to an officer, or a commission of officers, the duty of making the necessary inspections and purchases. Mr. WELLES, however, departed from precedent in selecting a civilian to execute the business, the agent being Mr. MORGAN, a gentleman closely connected with him by marriage, and well known in this City as a brother and partner in business of Gov. E.D. MORGAN. To Mr. MORGAN was intrusted the business of receiving the tenders of those who had vessels for sale, and of arranging the bargain after a subordinate. of the navy had inspected and approved the ships. For these services, he collected from the sellers of shipping commissions at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent., -- commissions which, in the course of five months, resulted in an aggregate sum exceeding $90,000. From the National Treasury, Mr. MORGAN received no direct compensation.

MORGAN in the purchase of vessels for the Navy Department has been made the subject of inquiry by both Houses of Congress, and in the Senate, soon after the beginning of the ession, a resolution was adopted, calling upon the Secretary of the Navy for information in regard to the facts, which were apparently these: Directly after the opening of the war it became obvious that very large additions would have to be made to the Navy by selections and purchases among the commercial marine. The Navy as well as the Army has Boards of experts qualified to transact its details of business, and the established course for the Secretary of the Navy was evidently to assign to an officer, or a commission of officers, the duty of making the necessary inspections and purchases. Mr. WELLES, however, departed from precedent in selecting a civilian to execute the business, the agent being Mr. MORGAN, a gentleman closely connected with him by marriage, and well known in this City as a brother and partner in business of Gov. E.D. MORGAN. To Mr. MORGAN was intrusted the business of receiving the tenders of those who had vessels for sale, and of arranging the bargain after a subordinate. of the navy had inspected and approved the ships. For these services, he collected from the sellers of shipping commissions at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent., -- commissions which, in the course of five months, resulted in an aggregate sum exceeding $90,000. From the National Treasury, Mr. MORGAN received no direct compensation.

The facts, as communicated to Superintendent KENNEDY, were to the following effect. The complainant says his name is Rev. SAMUEL F. RANGENT, formerly of New-Orleans and a Priest of the Roman Catholic Church. He arrived in this City on Wednesday last, from Havana, and put up at the Metropolitan Hotel. During the afternoon, he says he made the acquaintance of a very genteel looking man, who said he boarded at the hotel. Some time in the evening the new acquaintance induced him to visit a concert saloon, situated in the basement of No. 600 Broadway. Mr. RANGENT asked his friend to take a drink in this saloon -- himself taking, as he says, water, peppermint and sugar. He had scarcely swallowed his drink before he became drowsy, and soon he was in a sound sleep. When he awoke, he discovered that a valuable gold watch, chain and cross, and also his pocket-book, containing papers valued at $2,000, were all gone. When he came before the police, about the first thing noticed by the Superintendent, was a commission as Chaplain in the First Louisiana Regiment, properly made and signed by Gov. MOORE. The date of it was May 13, 1861. Among his baggage was found a number of letters, which corroborated the story he told about himself, and which was as follows: He says he is a native of Missouri, where his parents now reside. He was educated for the Church in the City of Paris. When he returned to America he became assistant pastor of St. Patrick's Church, in New-Orleans, and was officiating us such when the war broke out. Soon after a commission as Chaplain was handed to him, and he was told that he must serve in that capacity in the First Louisiana Regiment. He was too much of a Union man, he says, to accept the office; and, seeing no other way to avoid the requisition, he at once fled to the City of Mexico. At this place he began to preach, and in one of his sermons he advised his congregation to read the Scriptures whenever they could find a correct version of them. This caused great excitement among the Mexican clergy, and the people of the city formed a plot to assassinate him. Of this he was informed by Mr. RICHARDS, the United States Consul at that place. Several shots were fired at him while he was sleeping in his room, and but for the fact that he had changed the position of his bed on account of the information from the Consul, his life would have been sacrificed. A day or two subsequently, he was attacked and stubbed in his side. (The marks of a wound are now distinctly visible,) and for weeks after, his life was despaired of by his attendants.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Adventures of a Clergyman in a Concer Saloon.; HE IS ROBBED OF OVER $2,000.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Adventures of a Clergyman in a Concer Saloon.; HE IS ROBBED OF OVER $2,000.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c4b4f62-d4ad-5591-8be0-4ea7e9825ff5,554,nyt://article/9c4b4f62-d4ad-5591-8be0-4ea7e9825ff5,

"A CURIOUS FIRE AND ITS ORIGIN. -- Yesterday afternoon, about 4 o'clock, a servant -- a girl 11 years of age -- in the employ of Mrs. PAGE, who keeps a boarding-house at the northeast corner of Fourth and Arch streets, announced to the inmates in great alarm that a fire had broken out in the cellar of the premises. This was found to be the case, and, although the fire had made some progress among the shavings and wood in the cellar, it was put out without the aid of the firemen. When Fire Marshal BLACKBURN was examining into the case a short time afterward, the inmates of the house were again startled by the cry of ""fire."" This time it was discovered to be in the attic, and had gained considerable headway. Policemen LOWRIE and HOPEN made their way into the room, notwithstanding the dense smoke, and, with the aid of water passed to them in buckets, extinguished the second fire. Nothing was found to indicate the origin of the fires, and for a while the whole affair remained in mystery, untilthe Fire Marshal suggested that the girl, MARY JANE BENDICK, who had first given the alarm of the fire in the cellar, might know something about it. Mrs. PAGE could not believe this possible, as the child had been with her over two years, and had conducted herself properly, although given to trifling acts of mischief -- such as cutting up clothing. Mr. BLACKBURN examined the child, but she stoutly denied all knowledge in regard to the matter. Satisfied that she was the cause of the fire, the Fire Marshal took her into custody, and when she reached the Central Station, she freely admitted that she had started the fires; that she was fond of playing with matches, and seeing the shavings in the cellar, she concluded they would make a ""nice bonfire."" After the flames had got some headway, she became frightened lest the house should be destroyed, and she gave the alarm.

She was held for a hearing to-day.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/18/archives/article-2-no-title.html,,"A CURIOUS FIRE AND ITS ORIGIN. -- Yesterday afternoon, about 4 o'clock, a servant -- a girl 11 years of age -- in the employ of Mrs. PAGE, who keeps a boarding-house at the northeast corner of Fourth and Arch streets, announced to the inmates in great alarm that a fire had broken out in the cellar of the premises. This was found to be the case, and, although the fire had made some progress among the shavings and wood in the cellar, it was put out without the aid of the firemen. When Fire Marshal BLACKBURN was examining into the case a short time afterward, the inmates of the house were again startled by the cry of ""fire."" This time it was discovered to be in the attic, and had gained considerable headway. Policemen LOWRIE and HOPEN made their way into the room, notwithstanding the dense smoke, and, with the aid of water passed to them in buckets, extinguished the second fire. Nothing was found to indicate the origin of the fires, and for a while the whole affair remained in mystery, untilthe Fire Marshal suggested that the girl, MARY JANE BENDICK, who had first given the alarm of the fire in the cellar, might know something about it. Mrs. PAGE could not believe this possible, as the child had been with her over two years, and had conducted herself properly, although given to trifling acts of mischief -- such as cutting up clothing. Mr. BLACKBURN examined the child, but she stoutly denied all knowledge in regard to the matter. Satisfied that she was the cause of the fire, the Fire Marshal took her into custody, and when she reached the Central Station, she freely admitted that she had started the fires; that she was fond of playing with matches, and seeing the shavings in the cellar, she concluded they would make a ""nice bonfire."" After the flames had got some headway, she became frightened lest the house should be destroyed, and she gave the alarm. A few moments afterwards she was directed to carry wood into the upper room, and finding the attic unoccupied she concluded she would have another bonfire, and accordingly she fired some dresses hanging in the room, and these communicated to a barrel containing cast-off clothing. The girl is intelligent and has a full appreciation of the penalty for her offence, but can give no reason for committing it, other than a desire to see a bonfire.

There are other evils in ourpostal system of equal magnitude to this, which need ventilation, and which operate more injuriously on all classes. Take, for instance, a view of the law regulating the mailing of printed matter. What justice or propriety is there in providing that newspapers of the weight of three ounces shall be carried for a quarter cent each, without prepayment of postage, while on transient printed matter, such as circulars, prepayment is demanded in amount fifty times greater estimating the same by weight? Such a discrimination as the law makes is opposed to common sense. A proper reduction of the rates of postage on transient printed matter would tend more to make the postal system self-sustaining than any reform yet proposed, as it would meet the wants of business and commercial classes generally, and from these classes must be derived the most part of the revenue. If the present high rates charged on transient printed matter does not quite amount to a prohibition, it tends at least greatly to lessen the amount sent by mail.

"Misfortune does not pursue Mr. GRAU with its ordinary severity. It did not rain last night, nor did it snow, nor did the banditti who watch at the passes of the street, take the opportunity of thrusting well-dressed persons into the mud for the sake of a cent. The evening was not absolutely summery, but like the hole in Mercutio's side, it served. Perhaps three thousand persons availed themselves of its comparative pleasantness, and poured into the Academy with the determination of being pleased. Hence that bright and agreeable establishment was crowded in all the best parts, and well filled, even in the worst. The opera was VERDI's Ballo in Maschera, a work which we have had other opportunities of discussing, and which seems to have stepped pleasantly into the place of the Trovatore.

Perhaps three thousand persons availed themselves of its comparative pleasantness, and poured into the Academy with the determination of being pleased. Hence that bright and agreeable establishment was crowded in all the best parts, and well filled, even in the worst.

"One of the great arguments in favor of the most energetic prosecution of the war, and one we have cause to believe which acts upon those in command of the army, is the enormous cost with which it is waged. In other countries the army is a profession that either brings its own reward, or is entered both by officer and private as a means of providing occupation and support. The rank and file look for nothing beyond. The pay of the French soldier is fifty-six cents per month, but as his profession secures him a comfortable maintenance, and a certain degree of consideration and respect, he is content. He might not be able to better his condition if he could. His relation to the Government is a much closer one than prevails in this country. In most European countries, Governments maintain the right to a certain portion of the time of their subjects for military purposes. With us, Government asserts no such prerogative, and must pay for whatever services it receives at their worth to the party rendering them. And this is necessarily a high rate, as any soldier in the army can, with $100, become the owner of 160 acres of fertile land, from the cultivation of which he can, with ordinary thrift, soon raise himself to a comfortable independence. To make up our armies we must offer wages so high as to tempt the workingman to forego this privilege, or wages which, in the course of a year, should he then get his discharge, will give him a sum sufficient to start him in the world, and make him the owner of a farm. In times past the army has cost this country, on an average, $1,000 annually, per man, rank and file. We are not now getting along at a lower rate. If we have 660,000 men in the field, we are spending at the rate of $660,000,000 annually, for the army alone. We must add $150,000,000 more for the navy, coast defences, and the civil list. It is clear that we cannot long wage war at such cost. The French Budget for 1860 waa 315,000,000 francs, or $65,000,000 for a force on a war footing of 750,000 men, and in addition a reserve on a peace footing of 115,000 men. But such an expenditure has brought the Emperor to his wits' end for money. We are spending at ten times this rate. We are a a richer people, but from the great diffusion of our people over a wide territory, we may not be so well able to pay a larger sum per head to the support of Government. Our armies have rushed into the field. With all that has been borrowed, the floating debt of Government to-day probably equals $100,000,000, and is still running on at a rapid rate. We can pay for the present. But it is evident that we cannot indefinitely prolong the war. We shall, if continued long, sink under the exhaustion. But this need not, and we trust will not, be. We are assured of a movement in every direction, and we are confident that complete success will follow whenever and wherever it is made.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/18/archives/the-argument-for-energetic-action-by-the-army.html,,"One of the great arguments in favor of the most energetic prosecution of the war, and one we have cause to believe which acts upon those in command of the army, is the enormous cost with which it is waged.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/19/archives/a-notice-to-norfolk.html,,"Maj.-Gen WOOL is disposed to sacrifice none of the amenities of war. According to a dispatch from Baltimore, he has given the Commander at Norfolk notice to remove the women and children from that place, the inference being that a bombardment is to commence at an early day -- unless, with true military guile, the men-of-war who are steaming up beneath the' guns of Fortress Monroe are to take a sudden and unanticipated direction, and annihilate Yorktown, or pour shells into rebel camps along the James River. At all events, he has furnished the best possible commentary upon the charge of inhumanity which the London Times brings against our Northern campaigning. A city, which had lost its character of a loyal and pacific town, and had suffered itself to become purely a military post, is entitled to no such notice, and its extension is, therefore, an act of exalted benevolence.

Somehow or other they can't succeed in getting the bit of bunting just to their mind. It formed the chief subject of deliberation at the first sitting of the rebel Congress months ago. Finally, after a period of incubation, compared with which the hatching of the ovum mundi whereof SANCONIATHON speaks, was a light and frivolous task, the ""Committee of the Flag"" rushed out, shouting eureka, and bearing in triumph the ""Stars and Bars.""

For they throw no small fight upon several questions of taxation and war finance which, in the present crisis of our national affairs, are filling the public mind with anxiety and eager desire for information. During the whole period from 1793 to 1815, it is well known that the energies and resources of the British people were put to the severest trial. A large proportion of the wealth-producing classes was sent abroad in the army or navy, or employed in unproductive labor. Subsidies and loans were advanced to foreign Powers. The home markets were not, as in our present struggle, benefited by the war funds being spent in the country. Commerce was for years preyed on by hostile cruisers. English goods were prohibited from entering the continent of Europe. Yet, amidst much individual suffering, and in spite of all that a NAPOLEON, wielding the strength of the twenty-eight millions of France, could do for its destruction, the British nation prospered and grew rich with a rapidity and steadiness seldom seen in the history of nations. The war cry seemed to rouse the energetic masses of the British people from their lethargy. The indomitable spirit which gave victory to battalions in the field, fired the hearts of the peaceful workers of the productive army at home, and stirred all classes and all men to labor, to save and to accumulate capital. Hence, in the words of one of England's greatest statesmen, ""commerce and war flourished side by side and both achieved unwonted victories.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TAXATION AND WAR FINANCES IN ENGLAND.; Uprise of the Actual System--Its Loading Traits--Its Defects--Characteristics and Principles Appropriate to America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'TAXATION AND WAR FINANCES IN ENGLAND.; Uprise of the Actual System--Its Loading Traits--Its Defects--Characteristics and Principles Appropriate to America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/762e8df7-0ecc-5b47-9220-826724977aec,2482,nyt://article/762e8df7-0ecc-5b47-9220-826724977aec,

It is the only seceded State that has regiments of loyal troops in the National service. In the eastern part of the State, loyalty, protesting and fighting loyalty, is greatly in the ascendant. In the central section, refugees aver that the same spirit is now becoming dominant; and even in the West, where treason has been most rampant, it is evident, from many signs, that there is still an undercurrent of Unionism, which will appear strong and active as soon as the people are relieved by our army from the terrorism inaugurated by the rebel leaders. We have published scores of news items, lately, from the Tennessee rebel papers, stating that bodies of Unionists, numbering from a dozen to a hundred, had been arrested by the rebels in counties west (as well as east) of the Tennessee River -- in Hardeman, Madison, Gibson, Dyer, &c.; while other counties, as Weakley, are declared to be dangerously Union.

"WALTER GLOVER, known as the carrier between Dunfries and Edinburgh, in the time of BURNS, died on Sunday last, at Ferneyside, in his native parish at Liberton -- an extraordinary example of longevity, being in his 104th year, having been born on the 18th of July, 1758. Of late there have been recorded the deaths of persons of from seventy to fourscore years who were able to say that when children they had seen our great national bard; but here was a man who was born before the poet himself, and had frequent occasion to meet and converse with him, a recollection the old man warmly treasured. When BURNS was exciseman at Dumfries, rum was extensively imported there, and GLOVER was frequently employed to convey it to Edinburgh. The permits on these occasions required to be signed by the poet, and, contingent on the arrival of the vessels, these documents were often required either at a very late or a very early hour. GLOVER was wont to state, as a proof of BURN's regularity and business habits, that sometimes when he used to apologise for disturbing him at these untimely hours, the poet said: ""WALTER, it is but my duty, and never hesitate at any hour to call on me to do it."" GLOVER and his connection with BURNS were thus alluded to at the Great Centenary Meeting in Edinburgh, the 25th of January, 1850. The Chairman (Lord ARDMILLAN) said: ""I understand that we have now present among us in this great assemblage the only man who saw the day which this day celebrates -- one man alone, when generations have been swept to their graves, lives to be present now who lived when BURNS was born.

[Loud cheers.] Mr. WALTER GLOVER then ascended the platform amidst loud cheers, and to the amazement of the audience, recited ""Tam o'Shanter"" from beginning to end with a strong voice, and with ""due emphasis and discretion.""

Within the last two years he wrote out the poem of ""Tam o'Shanter"" in a bold, steady, legible hand, amazingly like the poet's handwriting, and this was done without the aid of spectacles. For the last few months Time has been laying his inexorable hand upon him, but very gently, and he retained possession of his faculties, his memory especially, to the very last. It is only a month ago that he was heard to relate with great unction some of his humorous stories, and to make some shrewd observations on recent and passing events. He was a great reader -- an enjoyment of which his failing sight nearly deprived him during the last year; and he had the rare gift of remembering every remarkable event he had seen, heard, or read of since he was three years old.

"Mr. COLFAX, with less than his usual good sense, has just introduced a bill into the House of Representatives to prohibit newspapers from being delivered on post roads except by the Government mails.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/19/archives/newspaper-taxation.html,,"Mr. COLFAX, with less than his usual good sense, has just introduced a bill into the House of Representatives to prohibit newspapers from being delivered on post roads except by the Government mails. If the object of the measure is to increase the revenue, it must prove as bad an expedient as could well be devised. For so offensive a law would he evaded by the public in every possible way, and the heavy expenses entailed on the Department would more than absorb the largest possible proceeds of the tax. And not only would there be failure in point of productiveness. This fiscal expedient would be extremely unpopular in this country, and would expose us to universal derision abroad. For it has always been the boasted policy of our Government to foster the circulation and promote the prosperity of the public Press. Hence no people in the world have so many newspapers, nor does any country contain as many newspaper readers. And is it to be endured that, with the proud position of the United States, as regards newspaper enterprise, we should resort to a prohibitory enactment which could be enforced, or would be endured, in no European country? In England, the Government at no time have ventured to prevent the conveyance of newspapers by any method convenient to the sender. The British newspaper tax had its origin in an aristocratic jealousy of the people, and in a desire to prevent them from informing themselves on political subjects. But the impost was always odious. It has long been merely nominal, and was in 1840 repealed altogether. The use of the mails is now open to the Press as to other departments of public usefulness. But now, as always, it is optional to send papers by mail or by any other means. If sent by mail, the postage is two cents, which may be paid either by affixing a postage stamp to the wrapper, or by having a newspaper stamp impressed on the paper before it is printed. There is, however, this concession made by the English Government in favor of the impressed stamp. The newspaper bearing it is transmissible by mail as often as the owner pleases within fourteen days of publication. But the affixed postage stamp, though equal in cost, will only carry the newspaper once. Thus the English Government regards the stamp simply as payment for postage, and charges the public journals for the use of post-office facilities only when these facilities are employed. Perfect freedom being thus conceded, express agents have sprung up in England who convey newspapers to the public several hours earlier than they would be received by mail. The same plan has been adopted here with some improvements. We have hitherto been in advance of Europe in almost every department of newspaper enterprise. The country now needs more than ever the influence of enlightened journalism. Shall we voluntarily recede from our position and without any benefit to the revenue, cause serious inconvenience to the public? If newspapers are to be taxed at all, let the impost be laid by some method which will be as little open as possible to the objections which must lie against all taxes on knowledge.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Newspaper Taxation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Newspaper Taxation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4d40390-d619-5abf-be36-6b9ace7ac9e9,536,nyt://article/c4d40390-d619-5abf-be36-6b9ace7ac9e9,

Editorial sees Missouri soon ceasing to be area of battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/19/archives/missouris-pacification.html,Editorial sees Missouri soon ceasing to be area of battle,"It does not seem likely that these will be much more fighting in Missouri this winter -- if indeed ever again. Gen. PRICE is still at Springfield with some seven or eight thousand men; but as, at the beginning of the present year, he became a ""Major General of the Confederate States,"" (instead of, as heretofore, a General of the Missouri State Guard,) and as he is now under command of JEFF. DAVIS, it is likely that he and his men will be ordered to some point where they can be of practical service. The Richmond leaders must see the hopelessness of the rebel cause at least in Missouri; and they will not be willing to waste powder and men, out of a mere romantic desire to uphold its ""rights,"" as PRICE has done. But if he be not at once ordered to another field, he will undoubtedly stampede the State rapidly enough as soon as the National expedition now forming at Leavenworth is put in motion. At one time the rebellion in Missouri looked formidable; but the army of fifty thousand flushed rebels which marched to Lexington on its way to Jefferson City and St. Louis, has dwindled and scattered; and the second fifty thousand, whom PRICE urged in such piteous terms to rally to his standard, never responded to the call. Not more than five thousand of the ""State Guard"" transferred their services to the regular rebel army. The rest have quietly gone back to their homes and farms for the Winter, tired of soldiering and rebellion. It is said by PRICE's organ that they have only disbanded for the Winter, and that they are to rejoin him in the Spring; but the system of military police now in operation over the greater part of the State, and which by Spring will be extended over the whole of it, will prevent the formation of these rebel squads, or their coming together anywhere, if any of them should be formed. Henceforward there is prospect of some irregular guerilla fighting, and irruptions of bodies of rebel marauders at one point or another over the State; but so far as the rebel campaign of conquest is concerned, it must soon be formally, as it is at present in fact, abandoned.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Missouri's Pacification."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Missouri's Pacification."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9625069-89f4-5a24-91d1-a4a95e3209f3,870,nyt://article/d9625069-89f4-5a24-91d1-a4a95e3209f3,

For several months Past the proprietor of the establishment has missed large quantities of cloth, and other articles, but it was no until very recently that any evidence could be obtained tending to implicate MILLER, in the transaction. Officer NIVEN, of the Second Precinct, arrested the accused, who, on being conveyed to the Station-house, made a partial confession of the crime. He admitted having taken two pieces of cassimere cloth on the 14th inst. The total value of these pieces was $60. MILLER furthermore stated that he would not have stolen the cloth, had it not been for the urgent persuasion of a man named HEYMAN GEIGERMAN, who is a cap-maker, doing business at No. 415 Eighth-avenue. The two pieces of cloth just mentioned were sold to the latter for the sum of $15. A piece of silk velvet, taken from Mares' store, valued at $28, was disposed of to GEIGERMAN for the small consideration of an ordinary cloth cap, valued at $1. MILLER also states that GEIGERMAN has urged other clerks in the store of M. MARKS to rob their employer and sell the goods to him. Upon the information thus received, Officer NIVEN proceeded to Mr. GEIGERMAN's place of business and took him into custody as the receiver of stolen property. In his possession were found some of the goods which had been stolen from Mr. MARKS.

"As our political relations with the Northern States of America still continue of a most unsatisfactory nature, and as there is no prospect of a speedy reopeding of the Southern ports fo Trade, it becomes necessary that we should enter into some details in reference to that great staple, Cotton, viewed in relation to imports, consumption, stock, speculation, and foreign demand. The year 1861 opened with an adverse movement in the Bank rate for accommodation, and the result was that great disinclination was shown to speculate in the article, even at a reduction in the quotations of 1/2d. lb. In the second quarter, however, owing to the impending civil war, the market became somewhat excited, and prices advanced 3/4d. lb., Middling Orleans having touched 8d. lb. in June. During the following four months the currencies improved 2d. lb.; but in November, arising from a great falling off in the demand on the part of our spinners, prices were slightly reduced. At one time, indeed, a few forced sales took place at 2d. lb. less money. The year closed, however, with some firmness, at 11 7/8d. per lb. for middling Orleans. Thus it will be perceived that the trade has been in a most uncertain state, and surprise may well be expressed, considering that we have imported 739,330 bales less cotton from America than in 1860, that the quotations have not exhibited a far higher range. The fact appears to be, that the large operators in the article have wholly miscalculated the power of India to furnish us with additional supplies. At one period we were told that it would be impossible to draw larger quantities from the East, whatever might be the price offered for it; but official returns inform us that the arrivals from Bombay were 986,290 bales, or 423,550 bales more than in the previous year. This is certainly a most gratifying feature in the trade, because it proves that, eventually, with due care in the cultivation, we may become wholly independent of the States for any amount of supply that we can possibly consume. It may, however, be asserted that we shall never be able to produce elsewhere the exact quality of cotton used in our manufacturing districts -- consequently, that it cannot come into competition with American importations; but those who hold the doctrine that we cannot exist as a great manufacturing and exporting country without States cotton, will probably find that -- though, for the moment, we may suffer some inconvenience and loss from a falling off in our usual quality, and from comparatively high quotations -- English enterprise, skill, and intelligence will, at no distant period, triumph over the prejudice In favor of Southern productions. They have found an extensive market here, simply from their low value and good quality; but if our usual importations are to be withheld for another year, and if we continue to offer a reasonable price to all the world, there will be no want of supply to meet our necessities. In 1860, India furnished us with 562,740 bales: but, in 1861, the arrivals from that quarter were 986,290 bales, as above stated. At one period, we estimated the quantity at 1,000,000 bales, and, subsequently, at 1,250,000 bales, allowing in the latter estimate twelve months [???] Bombay. It will therefore, be seen that [???] first calculation only exceeds by 13,710 bales the actual quantity arrived in, be it observed, a most uncertain and fluctuating market. As there were no large operations in India during the first two months of the year, the supply of 986,290 bales must be considered as merely the effect of ten months' transactions. Give the East a fair scope for the whole twelve months, and the advantage to be derived from highly remunerative prices, and the whole quantity we have stated will be forthcoming.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/20/archives/the-cotton-supply-question.html,,"As our political relations with the Northern States of America still continue of a most unsatisfactory nature, and as there is no prospect of a speedy reopeding of the Southern ports fo Trade, it becomes necessary that we should enter into some details in reference to that great staple, Cotton, viewed in relation to imports, consumption, stock, speculation, and foreign demand.

They have been delayed a few weeks for the exact Custom-house figures for the closing month of December, and are now presented complete from official data. The results teach that a year of the greatest activity in selling abroad is not incompatible, in this country, with a season of civil war. They also teach that our people readily adapt themselves to the smallest possible amount of buying abroad when the warnings and necessities of domestic troubles, like the present, demand such economy. It was much regretted last Spring that the Morrill Tariff was onaeted, coincident with the threatenings of the civil war which broke out six weeks after its approval by the late Executive. It was believed to be inauspicious for the good feeling and sympathy which we had a right to look for from the great commercial States of Europe. And it is not improbable that it may have done us harm in this direction; though, from the recent conduct of England on questions growing out of the Southern rebellion, it now seems questionable whether any tariff on our side, short of practical free trade, would have altered the course of that portion of her Press and people who have thrown the whole weight of their influence against us, and their undisguised sympathies in favor of armed and unholy rebellion. Insomuch, therefore, as the Morrill Act has contributed to the question of domestic economy in season of War, we have probably less to regret now than we supposed we had in March last. At all events, it is not likely that we shall make haste to repeal its specific duties upon British manufactures to accommodate that particular interest. The staples of iron and iron fabrics, and of woolen goods, of which we are able to command an abundant supply at home, will, no doubt, remain taxed, as against English competition, as they now are, until the end of the war, if not for some time after. In this determination we may not hope to please the factors and special agents of the English interest referred to among us, but we shall, at least, consult our own sense of economy, and do no violence to our partialities for our own wares, which we have both the skill and abundant raw material to fabricate.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What we Buy and Sell Abroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What we Buy and Sell Abroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b5fad355-e259-5985-af4d-dae155006b24,1225,nyt://article/b5fad355-e259-5985-af4d-dae155006b24,

Reports from Confederate States,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/20/archives/treason-in-high-places.html,Reports from Confederate States,"If the war for the Union fail, its failure will probably be caused more by treason than by force of arms. There is every reason to believe that the success of the rebellion hitherto has been secured almost wholly by treasonable communications from trusted men in our own ranks or employed in the management of military affairs. Many such communications are known to have been made, and many more are suspected to have been made, ever since the beginning of the war. Again and again the Confederates have boasted of their previous knowledge of all the movements of our armies; and many facts have proved their boasts true. We have just learned a most astounding circumstance, which may well make every patriot's heart sink in dismay, and almost in despair. An officer of high character has informed us that, to his knowledge, on the day when the Pensacola ran the gauntlet of the rebel batteries, and before the usual hour for communicating the countersign of the day to our pickets opposite one of those batteries, the rebel pickets boatsfully shouted the correct countersign across the river, and added: ""The Pensacola is coming down to-night!"" What does this fact prove? It proves that the countersigns which are sent from the War Department to our camps, are made known to the rebels by traitors in confidential positions in or near that Department, and that other information in reference to contemplated movements of our naval forces is likewise communicated to the enemy! What is to be the end of alt this? Can there not be some purification of the departments, so as to save our country from the destruction that must otherwise result from such fearful treachery? The depressing fact is known that preference for the Southern rebellion, or base corruption, has led officers of Government to carry on, unsuspected, correspondence with the rebels to an extent unknown and undiscoverable. Shall no effort be made to unmask these vile traitors? If discovered, shall we ""swear them and let them go,"" or shall we rather hang them to the first lamppost? If ever a crime deserved summary and extreme punishment, surely such a base betrayal of confidence as is shown by such acts should be most promptly and severely visited with the law's heaviest penalties. Whether prompted by love of the rebellion, or by bribes offered by the enemy, or by a mercenary wish to prolong the war, and profit by plundering the Government and the poor soldiers, such treason -- aggravated a thousand-fold by the confidence reposed in the traitors -- merits everlasting shame and contempt, and should receive such punishment-torture even-as will make the boldest forever shrink from following the base example.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TREASON IN HIGH PLACES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'TREASON IN HIGH PLACES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Washington Globe', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edf12003-f087-541a-85ae-5ec4cd9e2ed5,450,nyt://article/edf12003-f087-541a-85ae-5ec4cd9e2ed5,

The free and expeditious system of transporting printed matter outside of the mails that is now in practice is one of the most potent agents for the dissemination of knowledge among the people that has ever been devised, and is the result of long experience, prompted by the inability of the mail or post-office system to meet the emergencies of the case. From this system has grown the vast increase in the circulation of daily and weekly papers, magazines, &c., &c., and from this increased sale and circulation has grown a demand for a great amount of labor to produce the presses to print these papers for the paper on which they are printed, the ink they are printed with, machinery for the manufacture of the paper, for the production of twine, for the use of car's, wagons, &c.; in fact, there is scarcely a branch of industry that has not been affected beneficially by the increased sale and circulation of printed matter outside of the mails : and to interfere with these interests is to cause a great wrong to all concerned, with no benefit to the department. The true duty of the Government is to let the people devise their own modes of transportation of their merchandise, leaving them free, however, to use such facilities as Government provides for transporting other matters, without compelling them, under fine and penalty, to use such facilities. The Government claims the right to manage the transportation of the Written correspondence of the country. This requires certain machinery.

The present system of transporting printed matter outside of the [???], has also given labor to thousands of persons, who, but for this, would now be crowding other and overstocked labor markets. The bill proposes the granting of licenses by the Post-master-General. Now, it there is any one thing more than another that the people of this country detest, it is the License System. It is one of the most despised relies of a bygone system of Governmental Espionage that was always condemned by every people, and by none more than by our own. We have none too great a respect for the necessary and proper officers of the Government, such as tax-gatherers' customs officers and the like, who have no license for special purposes, or for private profit, and when it is proposed to create a most odious monopoly, as this bill does, and then license special persons to make a profit out of that monopoly, the system of license becomes utterly abhorrent, and must beget the most intense hatred of the system, and a determination to evade its requirements. The true theory of government is to have as few laws as possible, and have those such as will command the respect and voluntary obedience of its people -- Lot to burden them with odious enactments that they will be sure to revolt against.

This gentleman had many acquaintances at Washington, where he served in Congress, and in the City and State of New-York, where, only fifteen months ago, he participated in the Presidential canvass for the Union ticket. In politics he was, until very recently, the reverse of a Nullifier or Secessionist, and his participation in this unholy rebellion against the Union, the Constitution and the enforcement of the laws, was a singular contradiction to the tenor of his political career as a journalist and Congressman. It was, of course, the subject of deep and sincere regret to his old associates of the Whig and American line at the North and his Union friends nearer home, all of whom respected his firm but unobtrusive bearing in public life, and to many of whom he was best known for his integrity and nice sense of honor in private life.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fate of Zollicoffer.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fate of Zollicoffer.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/48267026-7633-5f54-be96-f6939f8f00d0,452,nyt://article/48267026-7633-5f54-be96-f6939f8f00d0,

The first one in the great chain of battles has been fought in Kentucky, and has resulted gloriously for the National arms. On Friday night last, we gather from our dispatches, the rebel General ZOLLICOFFER, finding that Gen. THOMAS had manoeuvred so as to gain his rear, and had thus forced a fight upon him, marched out of his intrenchments at Mill Creck, on the Cumberland, and proceeded to attack Gen. [???] in his camp at Somerset. The National pickets were driven in before daylight, and the battle commenced in the early morning. The field was a hotly-contested one, and the fighting lasted until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when ZOLLICOFFER himself having been killed, the rebels fled back in commission to their intrenchments, leaving their dead and wounded on the field. This advantage was followed up rapidly by our victorious troops, who pursued the flying rebels to their fastness, where they were attacked on Sunday by the combined forces of SCHOEPF and THOMAS, and still further punished. Our victory was most complete, and the National Flag now floats over the rebel intrenchments, lately thought to be impregnable. The losses on both sides are stated to be heavy.

Our accounts of the battle in Eastern Kentucky are thus incomplete. A first dispatch announces a conflict between Gen. SCHOEPF, commanding Union forces, and Gen. ZOLLICOFFER, in which the latter was killed and his force beaten. The scene of the encounter is located at Somerset, the position occupied by SCHOEPE. A later account places Gen. THOMAS in command of the Unionists, and names no battle-field. And a dispatch yet later represents that Union leader, assisted by Gen. SCHOEPF, as following up the first success by a brilliant attack upon the enemy's intrenchments at Mill Spring, over which the National colors are now waving. THOMAS, we had learned from earlier advices, was advancing with a strong body of troops from Columbia toward the intrenched position of ZOLLICOFFER'S army, at Mill Spring, on the Cumberland River, while SCHOEPF remained in his lines at Somerset. It was probably the purpose of THOMAS to outflank and cut off the retreat of the rebels; and the rebel commander discovering the aim of the National General, and declining to be caught among the hills of Mill Spring, as in a trap, may have advanced to meet the assailant before he could be reinforced, and before SCHOEPF could cooperate. We only know that the battle was offered by the rebels, and lost by them, after what must have been a fierce conflict, and the sacrifice of two leaders as conspicuous as ZOLLICOFFER and young BAILIE PEYTON. The vanquished fell back to their intrenchments at Mill Spring. Thither they were pursued by the victors assailed, and finally obliged to capitulate.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Union Victory in Kentucky.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Union Victory in Kentucky.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e7b8dfb-cd17-5281-ab84-476ec62fb704,682,nyt://article/6e7b8dfb-cd17-5281-ab84-476ec62fb704,

To realize this idea is the end of fiscal science, the central principle of which is that every citizen should contribute to the support of the Government according to his stake in society, or to the income he enjoys under the protection of the Slate. It is of paramount importance for the public at the present moment to avoid the two-fold error into which certain superficial thinkers have fallen, of overrating the fiscal burdens incident to our present war, and of underrating the strength we have to bear them. One hundred and fifty millions of dollars is surely an annual contribution for the management of our common Government which twenty millions of willing, energetic, free people, can raise without the smallest difficulty. Were it possible to lay a tax averaging about two cents a clay on every person, the problem would be solved; and none of us are so poor as to feel the pressure of such a burden. Even if double the sum were called for, the overflowing of our prosperity, a few crumbs from the table of luxury, a little thrift and self-denial every day, would be enough to meet the demand.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Tax Bill.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Tax Bill.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8f20c57e-ef98-5f9f-8c92-48bdd1465d14,557,nyt://article/8f20c57e-ef98-5f9f-8c92-48bdd1465d14,

It is of very slight material, only a luminous thread from the consuming fires of the great French Revolution, but trembling with issues of life and death. A veteran soldier discovers a daughter amongst the prisoners under his charge, and to secure her escape, arranges with a comrade for the midnight watch. He is prevented from going on the desired duty by another comrade, who drugs his liquor, and when the number is called, takes his place. The veteran is aroused from his stupor by the sound of shots, and learns with agony that they were aimed at his daughter. Frenzied with rage he seizes the comrade who he fancies has wronged him and wildly tells him the cause of his distraction. This leads to an explanation. The comrade is the lady's husband and an aristocrat; the shots fired were signals, and the drugged liquor was simply the means of securing the opportunity to forward the escape of his wife. But the course of true love never did run smooth. The garrison is turned out, the boat containing the fugitive fired upon and swamped, and the unfortunate brought back. In this serious emergency, a comic deus steps forward and announces that the reign of ROBESPIERRE is at an end and that all the prisoners are free.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Winter Garden.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Winter Garden.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f1a4c86-c2d1-5f91-9a40-f7af9d41c4dc,406,nyt://article/9f1a4c86-c2d1-5f91-9a40-f7af9d41c4dc,

At the hour named them were perhaps one hundred people present, principally persons from the ship-joiners' department. Mr. LEAK, who has heretofore presided, took the Chair on this occasion, and called the meeting to order. Messrs. ARCHIBALD and WOOLSEY, of the Committee appointed to proceed to Washington and look after the interest of the employes of the Navy-yard, made a verbal report, showing that in accordance with instructions they went to Washington and consulted with the Naval Committees of both Houses, the Secretary of the Navy, and also a number of Congressmen, relative to repealing the eighth section of the law recently passed regulating the pay and hours of labor for men employed in the different navy-yards.

It is unfortunate that in dealing with the other sex the author seems to lose his buoyancy, and falls either into a condition of maudlin sentimentalism, or of a mood absolutely unamiable. Thus whilst we all recognize the flightiness of Young Rapid and the solidity of his sire, we can only accept Miss Vortex with the deference due to an old stage tradition, and feel quite sure that, if the other two female parts were not intrusted to pretty women, they would be tiresome if not superfluous. MORTON was afflicted with a mania for moral sentiments, and with gallant but injurious prodigality he has bestowed an undue proportion thereof upon his fair friends, who in consequence are rather severe. This remark applies more especially to the character of Jessy Oatland, the remaining part of Ellen being too slight for analysis.

Editorial on British views of war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/22/archives/brummagem-and-brighton.html,Editorial on British views of war,"It is rarely the outside observer has an opportunity to sound the opinions of the English people. In England far less than in America does the Press reflect the sense of the masses; and when Parliamentary orators go down to their constituents, to deliver themselves upon the urgent topics of the moment, the audience is very apt to be packed like an unfair jury, and not only the resolutions, and vote of thanks, but the very cheers, come in by preconcert. By the latest arrival from Europe, however, we are favored with two unmistakably fair expressions of what ""the people"" think upon the American difficulty, and the right attitude of England. There was a public meeting at Brighton, and a public meeting at Birmingham, to both of which resolutions favoring a reference of the Trent, question to arbitration were submitted, and there were speeches made by influential people, arguing for and against those resolutions. In Brighton, the arbitration policy prevailed by a unanimous vote; in Birmingham, it was bowled down by a large majority, and a declaration adopted favorite a support of the action taken or proposed by the Ministry. An attempt to procure a reversal of this judgment was at once quelled. At Brighton there was a disposition to take the most friendly view of the subject; at Birmingham, which returns to Parliament Mr. JOHN BRIGHT, that friend of peace and of America, and the dauntless champion of the rectitude of our struggle with rebellion, the hostility to this country was undisguised, and the decision in favor of the Government was just so much sympathy with the known belligerent yearnings of the Premier.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Brummagem and Brighton.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Brummagem and Brighton.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/583f2853-2a92-5571-b8d6-6b2d5909b7dc,994,nyt://article/583f2853-2a92-5571-b8d6-6b2d5909b7dc,

"A meeting of the employes in the Navy-yard was called to be held last evening at 5 o'clock in Tammany Hall, York-street. At the hour named there were perhaps one hundred people present, principally persons from the ship-joiners' department. Mr. LEAK, who has heretofore presided, took the Chair on this occasion, and called the meeting to order. Messrs. ARCHIBALD and WOOLSEY, of the Committee appointed to proceed to Washington and look after the interest of the employes of the Navy-yard, made a verbal report, showing that in accordance with instructions they went to Washington and consulted with the Naval Committees of both Houses, the Secretary of the Navy, and also a number of Congressmen, relative to repealing the eighth section of the law recently passed regulating the pay and hour of labor for men employed in the different navy-yards. They received but little encouragement, but Mr. ARCHIBALD, in behalf of the Committee, prepared a petition asking a repeal of the obnoxious section referred to, and it had been presented by Mr. VAN WYCK to the House. The report of the Committee was accepted and adopted. After a somewhat lengthy discussion as to what course it was best to pursue, the Chairman was authorized to appoint a Committee to proceed to Washington to press forward the petition, and also to appoint a committee of one in each department of the Navy-yard to collect money to pay the expenses of the committee. Several persons present complained bitterly that they had been misrepresented by the Press in this movement; that they were disloyal, &c., when in fact they wore loyal citizens, and only sought to secure their rights as mechanics, and in a legitimate way.

CONTI, alias MARY CONTI, was brought before Justice QUACKENBUSH yesterday, upon the charge of swindling a large number of citizens in the upper part of the City by means of false pretences. Her plan has been to go from house to house, presenting a petition which sets forth that she is an Italian refugee, who landed in New-York, with her husband and three children, about one year ago; that her husband died as soon as he arrived here, and she was left with the three small children to support. The petition states that her only object in applying to the charitable for aid, is to enable her to return with her children to Italy, where she left six other little ones, who are now in great want. The interesting part of this woman's case, however, consists in the fact that in order that her petition should have weight, and her story be the more readily believed, she has acknowledged it before a Commissioner of Deeds. The certificate of the Commissioner was then taken to the County Clerk of the City and County of New-York, who gave his certificate, in the usual way, as to the Commissioner of Deeds, and then he attached thereto the seal of the county. These were all taken to the Governor at Albany, and to the State Department. The Governor signs his name, the Secretary of State his, and the great seal of the State of New-York is affixed thereto. Of course, the certificate from Albany is only to the effect that at the date thereof. JOHN CLANCY was County Clerk for the County of New-York. Thus is obtained the signatures of two of the highest officers in the State, also that of the County Clerk and a Commissioner, which, with three large seals attached to the several papers, really make a very imposing appearance, and apparently a very deserving case for the exercise of charity. The police state that sums of money to a very large amount have been obtained in all parts of the City by means of these papers. Copies of them have been made and circulated by different parties. The woman taken into custody sometimes goes by one name and sometimes by another, and she has papers to suit all filenames she bears. When brought before the Court she pretended to be unable to understand a word, either of English or French. But when the Justice admonished her, and begun to tell her what must necessarily be the consequence of her many impositions upon the public, she began to protest, and showed by her conversation and actions that she knew all that was said. Papers were also found upon her having the seal of the State of Massachusetts, whereby it appeared that not long ago she had been practicing the same impositions in Boston. She is a very good-looking woman, about thirty years of age. The Justice committed her for examination. He desires that all parties who have been swindled by this woman should appear before him to-day, at Jefferson Market Police Court, and give their testimony.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78929a60-1e7f-509a-8cc7-83df29fde531,2082,nyt://article/78929a60-1e7f-509a-8cc7-83df29fde531,

The fact that a gentleman, who had a wide-spread reputation as a writer and a humorist, and fortified by the experience of twenty years residence in Louisiana, was to speak on the rebellion, raised high expectations, and the most sanguine were not disappointed. Col. THORPE combines in his manner of oratory the best characteristics of the Southern stump, chastened by his Northern associations. While he has an argument, he enforces his ideas almost exclusively by illustrations, anecdotes and incidents, and we question if there is any one before the public who can tell anecdotes better, or with such an inexhaustible fun. The audience, as they came crowding one upon another with a marvelous rapidity, were one moment all excitement at the details of some tragic incident, and than by some unexpected humorous and witty recital, were convulsed with laughter.

editorial on victory strengthening loyal Union sentiment in Tennessee,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/22/archives/the-victory-its-effect-in-tennessee.html,editorial on victory strengthening loyal Union sentiment in Tennessee,"The loyal sentiment of all the border Southern States will be greatly strengthened by the victory on the Cumberland. Its influence will extend to Tennessee, North Carolina and Eastern Virginia. It may even find a response from Louisiana and her commercial metropolis, whose trade relations with the Upper Valley of the Mississippi were madly and wickedly suspended last Winter to the behests of the Cotton rebellion. The truth is, that Louisiana had as little heart in the first movement of secession as Tennessee or North Carolina. The Northwestern States, now in arms for the Constitution and the Union, as well as Kentucky and Missouri, were tributary to her commerce. For more than fifty years Ohio and Kentucky had been building up New-Orleans, and when the growth of Illinois, Indiana and Missouri, and the immense surplus products which they were enabled to market, were added, the strides of that city to commercial greatness were rapid and in every sense surprising beyond precedent. We do no violence to probability, therefore, in saying that Louisiana must feel that the victory already won, and the battles yet to be fought in the same quarter, are so many blows to unshackle her own trade and prosperity -- to give to New-Orleans the busy life it was wont to enjoy mainly through the custom of the Upper Valley, and to her sugar interest the profitable markets, which, until recently, it almost monopolized.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Victory Its Effect in Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Victory Its Effect in Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d86d6c2f-0ca7-55c6-8935-b5da12d49949,834,nyt://article/d86d6c2f-0ca7-55c6-8935-b5da12d49949,

We are still in doubt, however, whether there were two engagements -- one on Saturday, followed by another on Sunday -- or whether there was only the battle of Sunday. The Louisville dispatch gives the latter view of the case; but that is not by any means conclusive, as it is principally occupied with the details of THOMAS' engagement, and the ultimate route of the rebels; while all the previous accounts agree that ZOLLICOFFER marched out of his ""den,"" and attacked SCHOEPF the previous day. But we will, doubtless, have the precise details of the case immediately. At all events, it seems to have been a complete defeat of the rebels. Two hundred of their dead and wounded are said to have been left upon the field, and they left, also, their cannon, stores, and everything they had besides a steamboat and several barges in the river. Our loss seems to have been heavy, as one regiment alone reports seventy men hors du combat; but this is probably not to be taken as a measure of the loss in other regiments. No mention is made of the rebels under CRITTENDEN, which were reported by the rebel journals to have gone to the support of ZOLLICOFFER. They have probably retired to the Cumberland Gap. The rebels are so completely routed that they cannot make another stand short of that point.

We can easily understand this, for Mr. STANTON evidently has a thoroughly practical, organizing and executive mind; and he has proved it by the severest of tests. He has introduced an entirely new regime into the Department of which he is the head. First, he will do no business at his house, and receive no man whatsoever who comes thereon business. Second, letters and written communications will be attended to the first thing in the morning when they are received, and will have precedence over all other business. Third, six days in the week have [???] been surrendered to [???] the War Department: Mr. STANTON will consecrate Saturday to them -- Monday he will give to all other people whose business requires a personal interview. Fourth, to carry the war to a speedy and successful issue. Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday and Friday will be given to the war, and to nothing else. The Department will, on those days, be closed to all business not connected with active operations in the field. Lastly, to save army officers from becoming idlers, and to compel them to attend to their commands, the names of all such as frequent Washington, save on the orders of superior officers, and on military business exclusively, will be �dropped from the list.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW REGIME AT THE WAR DEPARTMENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW REGIME AT THE WAR DEPARTMENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1a2681d3-45ba-5143-a074-7c3cc17912a8,381,nyt://article/1a2681d3-45ba-5143-a074-7c3cc17912a8,

"-- There is no uniform method of settling the slave question possible. It will be settled, or will settle itself as the war goes on, in one way here, in other ways there. In Missouri, it is being solved by the removal of large numbers of the slaves into Arkansas and Texas, and by the flight of large numbers into Kansas and the Indian Territory. The disposal of the thousands who have freed themselves by flight there has been entirely different front the mode adopted in any other section; and the plan is, for that part of the country and for the domestic institution as it exists there, exceedingly simple and feasible. Rev. H. H. MOORE, of Kansas, who has lately been in charge of a large number of those slave refugees, has given, in a local newspaper, an account of his mode of disposing of them. It is briefly thus: He had on his hands, recently, 218 Missouri ex-slaves men. Women and children. The farmers and other residents, in the vicinity of his encampment across the Kansas line, came to his in large numbers, seeking to engage the services of these negroes as farmhands, laborers, servants, &c. One person wanted two or three of the men to work on his farm; another wanted a boy; another a family to occupy a vacant house; another a housemaid; another a little girl to bring up, and so on. And in that way homes and employment for the whole body were found among the farmers, and many more of these poor ex-slaves could have there found eager employers. Before parting with any one of them, his name, his age and the name of his old master were taken, a new name was given to him, and a written pledge was required from his guardian that he should he treated kindly and honestly. Several thousands of them have thus been disposed of in Kansas within the last few months, and so anxious are the farmers to secure the services of these faithful and industrious laborers, that it is [???] that all the spare slaves of Missouri would be gladly received and provided for. For the present Winter they will not, In general. receive much compensation other than boarding and lodging; but, with the planting time of next season, their regular wages will begin. Several free schools have been established for them, and there is nothing in the way of their indefinite social improvement. Thus and otherwise, the difficult question of solving the slave question in Missouri, is in the way of an easy enough solution; and one free State of the West is in the way of being furnished with an invaluable supply of labor. The slaves in Missouri are, in general, tolerably intelligent. Well trained to work, and quite capable of taking care of themselves as free workmen; and as hired labor has always been very difficult of obtainment in the free Western States, there is little fear of their becoming public burdens.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/23/archives/slavery-in-missouri.html,,"-- There is no uniform method of settling the slave question possible.

Several thousands of them have thus been disposed of in Kansas within the last few months, and so anxious are the farmers to secure the services of these faithful and industrious laborers, that it is [???] that all the spare slaves of Missouri would be gladly received and provided for. For the present Winter they will not, In general. receive much compensation other than boarding and lodging; but, with the planting time of next season, their regular wages will begin. Several free schools have been established for them, and there is nothing in the way of their indefinite social improvement. Thus and otherwise, the difficult question of solving the slave question in Missouri, is in the way of an easy enough solution; and one free State of the West is in the way of being furnished with an invaluable supply of labor. The slaves in Missouri are, in general, tolerably intelligent. Well trained to work, and quite capable of taking care of themselves as free workmen; and as hired labor has always been very difficult of obtainment in the free Western States, there is little fear of their becoming public burdens.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SLAVERY IN MISSOURI.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SLAVERY IN MISSOURI.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be79736d-e39b-5c28-a628-a0d7678cffc7,501,nyt://article/be79736d-e39b-5c28-a628-a0d7678cffc7,

editorial on news from Port Royal,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/24/archives/a-test-of-civilization.html,editorial on news from Port Royal,"The chemist LIEBIG affirms that the civilization of a people is accurately determined by the amount of soap it uses. Without disputing the justness of this standard we may hazard the assertion that it should not exclude others, and that one important measure of intellectual advancement is the degree of extension of epistolary correspondence. In this regard we are able to report good progress for South Carolina under the Union r�gime. The mail which the Atlantic brought yesterday from Port Royal to this City was swelled by no less than thirty thousand letters. It is stated, moreover, that the number of letters now sent from the New -- York post-office to Port Royal is equal to twice the amount formerly transmitted to the whole State of South Carolina. These are certainly notable statistics, and they bring out in startling antithesis the differentiating element of Northern and Southern civilization. It. cannot be said that either the disposition (on our part) or the facility for a free interchange of correspondence between New-York and South Carolina has been hitherto wanting. New-York has always been more Southern than any other city of the North, has always cultivated the closest ties, commercial and social, with the South. And yet the presence of a few thousand Northern volunteers on the Carolina coast swells the mails to an extent which the entire correspondence of the State never approached in ante-secession days.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Test of Civilization.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Test of Civilization.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f9e8fab7-00cc-548e-b21c-88d0767a1f4c,617,nyt://article/f9e8fab7-00cc-548e-b21c-88d0767a1f4c,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/25/archives/the-negro-question-a-school-of-modern-port-royalists.html,,"The letters from Hilton Head, to which we gave place yesterday, contain no more interesting information than that relating to the condition of the negroes. On the several islands occupied by our troops the aggregate number is about 8,000. These, we are told, generally continue of occupy the quarters, and pursue the labors which constituted their homes and business before their masters became fugitives, yielding readily to the superintendence of Col. REYNOLDS and his assistants, who have been intrusted with the duty of utilizing the products of their industry. They go early afield, perform the customary daily task, receive pay either in coin or in liberal rations of food and supplies of clothing -- the majority wisely preferring to forego the money - and show no disposition to lapse into that incurable indolence, which is so freely predicted of the slave uncompelled by the lash of an overseer. From involuntary they have suddenly become voluntary laborers. From the condition of machines they have been raised to the responsibility of free agents. And yet, abrupt and radical as the change has been, we discover no tendency to insubordination and disorder; no defective appreciation of the relation between labor and food; no eagerness to test their freedom by unlimited riot and self-indulgence. The industrial machinery moves on as if eight thousand brutes had not, like the victims of Ciree, been converted in a twinkling into men, with all the rights, privileges and liberties of manhood. They realize the necessity of education, and resort to the schools benevolence has opened for them. They value religious instruction, and attend voluntarily the church of which a Northern clergyman is the minister. In every way they exhibit a reasonable sense of the duties and exigencies of their condition, and if that sense partake rather of the instincts of the child, than of the judgment of the man, we know too well where the accountability for the defect is to be placed; and at the same time discover a sure foundation upon which a more decided character, and more matured understanding, may be raised.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Negro Question A School of Modern Port Royalists.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Negro Question A School of Modern Port Royalists.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1142c6cc-5ca2-556e-aa1f-a6598f68767a,765,nyt://article/1142c6cc-5ca2-556e-aa1f-a6598f68767a,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/25/archives/the-martyroom-of-the-innocents-in-the.html,,"TIMES of yesterday, we gave place to the complaint of ""A Parent,"" in regard to the merciless lessons assigned to pupils in one of our primary schools. Of the confirmatory statements with which we have since been deluged, we can only publish one or two ; and say of the rest, that they present painful evidence that the wisdom and sound judgment which, in other matters, prevail in our public school system, fail to reach this all-important subject. The scholars. We fear, are too generally overtasked. Health is the first requisite of manhood and womanhood. But when hours of confinement in school are too much protracted, and are then followed by hours of confinement at home over tasks with which the memory wrestles vainly, education does all it can accomplish to destroy the body, dwarf the mind, and discourage wholesome emulation. The error probably lies in assuming the capacity of the readiest scholar as the standard for all, and then by marks of merit or deficiency endeavoring to spur all to the attainment of that standard. It very often happens, however, that memory is given to those who have no other valuable mental trail, and the stimulus only places the light weights in advances ; while the student of far clearer perceptions, and sounder understanding -- the embryon of the future great man -- is degraded. disheartened and most unjustly shamed by his roll of demerit. What is wanted is a reduction of scholastic difficulties to a half-way plane, to which the slower minds will have to climb, and to which the more rapid ones may descend. Then, by a moderate appeal to the principle of emulation, justice may be done to the merits of all ; no mind will be overwrought ; physical education will have a chance to keep pace with intellectual ; and to the labors of the juvenile student will not be added that intense and cruel sense of care and anxiety, from which childhood should be scrupulously screened, and to which the actual system of excessive stimulus untimely exposes it. The error of the prevalent system may be ascribed to the well-intentioned, but inconsiderate ambition of teachers, to ""bring on"" their scholars with the utmost rapidity. It results in making no intelligent scholar a bit more intelligent while it creates dunces by the score. Let us, ladies and gentlemen, have a little less of the whip and spur! It is helpless childhood that cries to you.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MARTYROOM OF THE INNOCENTS.

The lecture was mainly that recently delivered by Mr. DICKINSON at the Academy of music. The speaker commenced by reviewing the position of the Republic at the out break of this infamous rebellion, and the reasons why it was impossible for us to do anything else but put down that rebellion. Since it had not been crushed as it should have been, it must be plucked up by the roots. [Applause.] It was fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, and lion in strength. He who would crush would be remembered when the shades of tradition had passed away forever. [Applause] Its ministering spinets were not the ignorant and vulgar, but the interregna men in whom a confiding people had reposed their trust. They could see its origin in the work of Senators. Cabinet officers and every department of the Government who had deliberately betrayed the Government and people upon whom they had fattened. Treachery in the army and navy and betrayed the union through us sworn defenders. The Confederated robbers who had stolen the Government's gold, had not even left a subcultures of cotton. As to their bends, they treated men own citizens worse than the Governed. As HOSEA BIGELOW said, ""They went off middle well for drinks, when there was a knee beheads them"".[Laughter and applause.] The exile object of the rebellion was to rear a mannerly on the ruins of this Republic with cotton for its king, and Slavery as the principal jewel in its diadem Judas Iscariot had lived before his time; if he had lived in the Nineteenth Country he would have been called upon to do the work of murkier for less than thirty pieces of silver. [Laughter.] But Judas set a good example to traitors -- lie went and hanged himself [Laughter and applause.] The speaker thrillingly destitute the signings of the traitor ARNOLD in his later info If just had lived to this time, he might have asked that java should secede under his urea -- [Laughter] -- and [???] too, might taken share in the same Government and glut his avarice on secession bonds. [Laughter.] Smith Carolinas hated our original Union and had inaugurated the rebellion. It was bow reaping its harvest. Like Narcissus, it would be wasted by its own passion. If it should be reproduced as a dower, it would be fortunate if like the century plant, it would bloom but once in a had years, and of a kind that could not propagate its peruses. [Laughter.] The goal of the exportations of south Carolina has been reached. Direct trade with foreign nations has been granted her by Commodore Durant. He his opened a cadet without tariffs or custom-houses, or unembarrassed by long credits. As the Yankee save she shell out, [Laughter.] A portion of Causation is in asnes; -- who was the consequences of war. They have been anxious for secession. But now they have turned to contemplate their terrible picture of coronation.

Where old Virginia -- the old Denison, the both-was place and gave of WASHINCROS, where is she how? Dragged, against the popular will into secession. In a empting to tear her of away from the Union, she has torn out her own vitas. Like CASAR, her heart has been pierced by conspirators and traitors, button ANTONY comes to bury, much less to praise her. [Applause.] Slavery, for which she has gone to war, has worked its own abolition. Her wealth, instead of taking wings to fly away, has taken legs and run away. [Laughter.] And all this too, not to bring [???] or freedom to man, but that a few scurvy politicians might rule a bark imps mob , called the Confederate states.

We should contacted the property of rebels tonally, absolutely [???] take every one of their slaves, and let Congress take some homage disposition of them -- [Applause] -- rush the retention by any and every means known by Christiaruy.

They seized upon an occasion when they might best inflating the Southern in and . If this ribbon was about [???] it would hare spring up [???] Success. But, on the contrary, the Border States had thought against session. The secret of the rebellion was in the horse of office seekers and fortune [???]. Florida, that could never live a fortnight without the General Government, was seeking her rights. [Laughter.] Why, She had hardly supported her own alligators. [Laughter.] Now either Government must conquer rebellion or sick beneath it. The very vitality and existence of this Government is at stake. We may weil in [???], ""Who is upon the Lord's side?"" Those who are not for the Union are against it. Lukewarm friends were worse than open enemies. We should be able to say with the elder BRUTUS, ""A man may have many children, but he can have but one country."" The hope of the rebellion had been in the countenance of loyal States, and if we should present a united front. It would carry terror to the hearts of the traitors. We must act in concert, all [???] together, and let the standard of merit be ardor in the cause, as when at the con fiagration none ask how it came, but all with one accord work to extinguish the flames; just so when they went to save the burning fabric of the Union, they stopped not to ask the cause of the fire, or which were the Democrats or Republicans, but they went as men to save the Republic. [Applause.] To consent to division of the Union, is to consent to destruction. We must strangle the serpent by the best means known to modern warfare. Whoever counsels division as a means of peace, counsels death. We can only consent to a disruption with the last breath of a strangled Union. [Applause.] Like the several members of the human frame, all parts of the Union are essential to each other. What section of the Union could surrender its right to Lexington and Bunker Hill? Who will carry a rebel passport to the grave of WASHINGTON? But can Government coerce a State? It can maintain the laws, and it will be for metaphysicians to determine whether the State has been coerced. When any State should refuse to send representatives to places of emolument, the day of millenium would have arrived. [Laughter] The rebellion was based upon infantry, cavalry and artillery, instead of liberty, equality and fraternity. [Laughter.] They were entitled to the benefit of having made the discovery of a system of government like the note of a swallow in a sand-bank, after the sand-bank had been removed. [Laughter.] The principles of the Confederate Government would shame a pirate or freebooter -- DICK TURPIN or ROBIN Hone. They did not steal -- oh, no. They merely ""resumed"" possession of the Government property. [Laughter.] Our fathers courted independence, but the struggle is forced upon us. The history of man is a history of conflicts.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/25/archives/a-welcome-word-from-the-secretary-of-war.html,,"-- It is obvious that the new Secretary of War has the genius to speak the words the Nation will welcome. His first order had the tone of the trumpet in it, and addressed itself to the instinct of military glory; but his order to-day strikes a softer tone, and will vibrate through the hearts of the people. This Department recognizes as the first of its duties to take measures for the relief of the brave men who, having imperiled their lives in the military service of the Government, are now prisoners and captives."" Accordingly two Commissioners are ordered to be appointed to proceed to Richmond and elsewhere, and, so far as the Confederate authorities will permit, take such measures as, may be needful to provide for the wants and contribute to the comfort of the prisoners they find, at the expense of the United States. It will be seen that it is the relief, not the release, of the captives that is contemplated. The latter result can best be brought about by the informal process of exchange now inaugurated; but so far as alleviating the sufferings of our captured soldiers goes-and those sufferings we know are neither few nor slight -- there can be no objection to the Government's taking such steps as may be conducive to that end.

It appears that a man named EDWARD SCOTT, a school teacher of much distinction in that part of the State, had married a widow TILFORD. Daughter-in-law of the late Major TILPORD, of Lexington, Ky., and on the evening above named Scott entered the room where the family were sitting, and without saving a single word, drew a revolver and fired at EDWARD TILFORD, a lad 11 years of age, killing him instantly. At this juncture the children rushed screaming out of the room. As the family were flying in great consternation, SCOTT fired at Miss EMMA TILFORD, aged about 18 years, and she fell bleeding to the floor, and died the next morning, A younger Miss TILFORD was also shot in the aim. SCOTT pursued the remainder of the family, but they succeeded in eluding him. and escaped. All the children were these belonging to his wife. SCOTT ransacked the house from top to bottom, breaking and destroying everything in his reach, and fearful of being pursued by his neighbors, who had assembled to protect the family, he ran above stairs, fastened the trapdoor, and cut loop-holes in the roof to fire upon his captors when they approached. After much man�nvering, he was felled by a blow from a neighbor, who came upon him in a different way from then safely secured and lodged in jail, to wait an examination. When taken, SCOTT was found to be well armed with revolvers, two double-barreled shot guns, a United States musket, a hatchet and a butcherknife; so that the horrible butchery of the helpless and unoffending family must have been coolly premeditated.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tragedy at Harrodsburgh, Ky.; A TRIPLE MURDER BY A SCHOOL-TEACHER', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Tragedy at Harrodsburgh, Ky.; A TRIPLE MURDER BY A SCHOOL-TEACHER', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab98f632-0a9c-5351-8e1c-6602d3ef2595,301,nyt://article/ab98f632-0a9c-5351-8e1c-6602d3ef2595,

SIGEL -- and we are sure there are few men in the loyal States who are not the friends and admirers of that time, gallant and scientific soldier -- will be glad to learn semi-officially from Washington that no news of his reported resignation has been received at headquarters. The President assured the German Committee from this City, who waited upon him, of that fact, and added that so highly did he esteem Gen. SIGEL'S services that he should decline to accept his resignation, but would give him a command in or out of Missouri, in accordance with his eminent abilities. He further said that he had instituted inquiries with the view to redress any wrong the General may have suffered; and that nothing had transpired to diminish his personal confidence in his skill and valor. This contradiction of a rumor which has caused such deep feeling among a large class of citizens, is very gratifying, and will do much to put at rest the charges of Know-Nothingism and West Point persecution which are rife in certain quarters. There is little danger in this war of the services of any officer or soldier who does anything, being long overlooked or undervalued. The people keep an eye on every movement, and know the names of every actor, and a thousand Presses chronicle their deeds; while no injustice or partiality will be tolerated.

They were taken by Col. HAYS, of the Sixty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers, an active and efficient officer. The Sixty-third were out on picket duty, and the attention of the sergeant of the guard being drawn to the tinkling of a cow bell in the bushes, with visions of new milk running through his head, he examined carefully, and to his intense astonishment, he found himself euchered of his milk, and no cows there, but he made the discovery that as he advanced, said cowbell retreated. The sergeant smelt a moderate-sized mice, and made a double-quick retrograde movement without investigating further. He immediately reported the fact to Col. HAYS. The Colonel secreted a squad of men in the woods, and the Sergeant again made himself conspicuous. Soon the gentle tinkle of a cow-bell was again heard. The Sergeant kept threshing in the bushes, and the bell gently tinkled, approaching all the while. Soon the squad in ambush had the satisfaction to observe the cautious approach, not of a cow, but of a veritable secesher with a cow-bell around his neck, and a six-shooter stuck in his belt. He came slowly on until within easy range of our men. The Sergeant then hailed him, and asked him where he had rather go 'to -- or to Washington.' 'To Washington, I reckon,' drawled the Secesher, 'I aint clothed for warm weather,"" and he came up, without looking to the right or left, and delivered himself up. He would have been looked upon as quite a hero by our men if the revengeful Secesher had not given information where the balance of his comrades were. That night Co. A, Pennsylvania Sixty-third, went about six miles outside our pickets, and took seventeen prisoners and six horses. One of the Seceshers requested the hostler to take good care of his horse, for he had had nothing to eat for two days.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBELS CAUGHT IN THEIR OWN TRAP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBELS CAUGHT IN THEIR OWN TRAP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/687bb110-bff0-5a1d-9359-c35ab9bed76d,327,nyt://article/687bb110-bff0-5a1d-9359-c35ab9bed76d,

He then speaks of the military preparations and expenses of the State; is justly severe on jayhawking; gives the present military organization of Kansas; pays a well-merited tribute to the valor of the First and Second at Springfield, and recommends that a list of the killed and wounded at that battle, and elsewhere, during the war, be entered on the documents of the State. The expenses of military organization have reached only about $10,000, which is owing to the personal application of the officers to their respective duties. He gives much credit to the Quartermaster and Adjutant-General, and recommends a suitable remuneration for their services. The apportionment to Kansas of the war tax is $71,743 33, which he recommends the State to assume. It is gratifying to know that the finances of the State are in a good condition, and that her credit is improving.

"Able and successful as Earl RUSSELL has, in general, been as Foreign Minister, he has certainly not been consistent as an interpreter of international law.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/26/archives/vagaries-of-international-law.html,,"Able and successful as Earl RUSSELL has, in general, been as Foreign Minister, he has certainly not been consistent as an interpreter of international law. Our St. Thomas correspondent recently communicated a case to us somewhat similar to the Trent affair, in which his Lordship made a very different decision from that pronounced by him touching the abduction of MASON and SLIDELL; and his very contrary interpretations in these two parallel cases lead inevitably to the conclusion that the British Secretary has two strings to his juridical bow, and that his expositions of international law have been dictated by expediency rather than by conviction of immutable right. The case reported in the letter of our St. Thomas correspondent occurred in Central America. Anarchy, as is well known, is the normal condition of the Spanish-American Republics, and New-Granada, unfortunately, is no exception to the general rule. Now it happened, some time since, that the Conservative faction having gained the ascendancy in Santa Marta, certain commercial men of the defeated party, with their families, fled thence, and sought refuge in Jamaica. But when ARBOLEDA, the Conservative leader, and his principal followers, had been expelled from Santa Marta, the said refugees determined to return. Accordingly, they sailed from Kingston in the British steamer Saladin, and, in due time, arrived at Aspinwall, where ARBOLEDA and his faction had, in the interim, established themselves. The Conservative chief, on learning that some of his enemies were on board the Saladin, gave orders that they should be seized, and taken forcibly from the vessel; but the British Consul at Aspinwall commanded the Captain of the steamer to hoist the British flag, and defied the New-Granadian officers to lay hands on the passengers. Under these circumstances ARBOLEDA thought it better to desist, and the returning refugees were suffered to proceed unmolested. Now in this case the British Consul acted well and with spirit, casting the aegis of his protection over innocent people, and shielding them from the vengeance of a sanguinary outlaw, who had no legitimate authority to claim them. But when the matter was reported to the Imperial Government, what was his reward? Why, a letter of reproof from the British Foreign Secretary to the British Minister at Bogota, condemning the Aspinwall Consul's conduct, and laying it down as a rule, that no MERCHANT steamer or vessel could give right of asylum to any person or persons charged with either civil or political offences.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Vagaries of International Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Vagaries of International Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d05efcf-b088-5966-bb95-93b1ca6fab48,623,nyt://article/9d05efcf-b088-5966-bb95-93b1ca6fab48,

The steamships which have been purchased and converted into armed vessels are many of them models of naval architecture, and nearly as strong as anything with wooden walls afloat -- built for braving the stormy waters of our South Atlantic coast in Winter time as well as Summer, for traversing in all seasons the iron-bound coast line from New-York to Halifax, and for other service equally trying and dangerous. Elsewhere we publish a list of these purchased vessels, with their present armaments, from which it will be seen that, in a few months, our navy has been increased by seventy-nine steamers, mostly new, carrying 335 guns; beside sixty ships, and other craft, carrying nearly 200 guns. This, of course, is exolusive of an immense number of transport vessels which have been purchased, and which, armed with a pivot gun, might, in case of necessity, be very efficient in certain kinds of naval warfare. Beside this, too, the fleet of steam vessels now getting built by the Government is rapidly being launched and put into active service. That fleet consists of fourteen screw sloops twenty-three screw gunboats, twelve light-draft steamers, and three iron-clad steamers, carrying altogether nearly 300 guns. A considerable number of these vessels are now doing good service on our coast and elsewhere; and our European news this morning announces that one of them, the screw sloop Tuscarora, has arrived at Southampton in pursuit of the Nashville. We should not be sorry if it came in contact with that insolent pirate craft not far out of the British Channel, so that John Bull might see out of what stuff our Navy -- which he so much despises -- is made. A letter this morning from one of our correspondents at Port Royal, also tells us what fine work our new gunboats are doing down there. They run up the creeks and rivulets, everywhere scattering and frightening the chivalry. Getting aground is to them a matter of no consequence; they ran ashore and then ran off again half a-dozen times during the last fight, and the conduct of the officers and crew of these plucky little ships seems to revive the old days of American naval gallantry. Our navy, everywhere, has done wondrously well during the war, and those who criticize it on account of the inefficiency of the blockade at certain points, should remember that our naval fleet has been very limited, and the work it had to perform prodigious.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Growing Naval Power.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Growing Naval Power.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c07b3822-4669-5f4f-9fca-1e9a4b283e6e,668,nyt://article/c07b3822-4669-5f4f-9fca-1e9a4b283e6e,

The residents in the vicinity believed it to be an explosion, caused by powder igniting in the building, and were much alarmed for a short time. The fire had no doubt been progressing for hours inside of the building, but owing to the fact that it had no vent, it spread itself through the building very slowly, and it was only when the front door was forced open that it burst forth with alarming fury.

An occasional exception, of course, is necessary to prove the rule -- that exception wc have in The Pilgrims of Fashion, by one KINAHAN CORNWALLIS. The faithful and conscientious reader always reads the preface of a book -- the more industrious ones commence at the title-page. The preface of Mr. CORNWALLIS' book ia simply an editorial on the war, written in that peculiarly diffuse and ornamental style for which the Herald has become so justly celebrated. It refers not at all to the book itself -- not even so much as to offer an apology for printing it. A rather mythical element of society, delicately distinguished as ""the shoddy aristocracy"" -- if we mistake not, the phrase originated, and finds daily repetition, in the columns of the journal before referred to -- comes in for the bitterest denunciation.

If then, there be any safeguards disclosed by financial science, and capable of being applied by financial skill, so as to prevent such a pernicious result, it is of the highest moment that they should be known. The history of our Continental money, as also that of the assignats and manuals of the French Revolution, may afford us some instruction.

Reviews of various issues for February,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/27/archives/the-magazines.html,Reviews of various issues for February,"-- We had occasion to speak in terms of well-merited praise of the January Atlantic. The February number is entitled to an equally kindly greeting. True to the instincts which have led it to reflect the color of the day, a ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" leads off the well-ordered columns. Despite the refrain of ""Marching on"" -- which seems to have been suggested by the song we have all heard the Massachusetts regiments sing, as they marched with bristling bayonets down Broadway -- we like this lyric much. If poetry can be said to have color -- and it is contended that music has -- we fancy that this would reveal itself to the subtle sense in a rich crimson, winning and nerving the soldier's soul like the notes of a trumpet. ""At Port Royal, 1861,"" a poem by Whittier, is worthy of that sweet singer and Quaker, though the introduction of the ""Song of the Negro Boatmen"" into the body of the poem does not, to our thinking, add to its quiet beauty. A devotional hymn, be the sentiment holy and refined as it may, written out in the mutilated English of a plantation, is too suggestive of negro minstrelsy. It were better heard than read. Esquire Bigelow contributes a magnificent poetical paper, whereof the baptismal name is ""Mason and Slidell -- A Yankee Idyll "" -- one of the most refulgent effusions that has yet been thrown from the Bigelow pen. In a sort of waking dream the poet heareth Concord Bridge and the Bunker Hill Monument discussing the Mason and Slidell question -- it is needless to say that they discuss it with more wit and wisdom than did the daily papers, both English and American. And then we have "" Midwinter,"" a pretty little poem, suggestive of the pure thoughts and feelings that should full with the snow-flakes. Maj. WINTHROP's story, ""Love and Skates,"" is concluded in this number. We like it rather better than the longer stories, from the same sparkling pen, which have lately been published. It has the same sparkle and snap, but the diamond is better cut, -- the eccentric edges that detract from the beauty of the gem, are not there. The reader of WINTHROP cannot fail to notice the element of moral purity that abounds in his works, -- a highsouledness that shrinks with mimosa-like sensitiveness from all grossness. If fair to judge men by their writings, truly must WINTHROP have been a noble BAYARD in character, a chevalier sans peur et sans reproche. In addition to the papers before mentioned, we have continuations of AGASSIZ's ""Methods of Study in Natural History,"" Mrs. STOWE's ""Agnes of Sorrento,"" ""A Story of To-day"" and Chapter II of the Chronicles of ""Fremont's Hundred Days in Missouri;"" ""Our Artists in Italy;"" ""The Experiences of the A.C.;"" ""Ease in Work,"" and the usual reviews and literacy notices, crown the cup of this brimming and sparkling Atlantic.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Magazines', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9535b49b-29f7-5476-8d78-17484ad42aef,2158,nyt://article/9535b49b-29f7-5476-8d78-17484ad42aef,

The London journals -- the extracts furnished by the telegraph are unfortunately drawn exclusively from those of the most belligerent antecedents -- accept the dispatch of Mr. SEWARD and the rendition of the two rebels, as a full satisfaction of the British demand, and as a restoration of the tarnished lustre of the British crown. It is conceded that the act of the American Government was at once graceful and consistent. Of that spirit of bravado, and disposition to represent cowardice as the motive at the back of our conciliatory temper, which there was too much reason to apprehend from journals so malignant as the London Post and Herald, we have no evidences whatever. The absence of these offensive traits may be merely due to the meagreness of the telegraphic summary. But we are disposed to think otherwise, and to believe that the amende of America has been as frankly received as it was frankly offered. It is, indeed, significant of the real direction of public opinion that the Press bespeaks anything but a welcome for the restored Commissioners. They are stigmatized as a brace of conspirators who have been balked in an attempt to embroil England in war; and who are entitled to no more respectful consideration than a pair of negroes fortuitously extricated by diplomacy from the clutches of a slave-catcher.

The rebel forces were fairly driven from the field by the gallant regiments of Kentucky and the Northwest. They retreated when no hope of success remained. They were routed and dispersed by our pursuing soldiery, and stayed not their coming even behind their own strongly intrenched camp-works, out of which they had marched for attack early in the morning. In a word, their army became a wild band of beaten and dismayed fugitives.

WEBB, who, until the 20th inst., was an officer in that Precinct. On the day last named, WEBB was tried by the Police Commissioners, and received a discharge from the Department. Capt. DOWLING had due notice of his dismissal, and at the same time was requested by the Commissioners to demand from WEBB his cap, shield, the buttons on his coat, and the book of rules and regulations -- they being, as is alleged, the property of the Police Department. Capt. DOWLING read the order to WEBB, and demanded of him the property in question. WEBB, instead of complying, suddenly made his escape from the Station-house. An officer was sent in pursuit, and when the fugitive was overtaken, he informed his pursuer that he would return without delay, and surrender the property to the Captain. He, however, did not fulfill his engagement, and has not since been seen at the Station-house. Upon a statement of these circumstances to the Commissioners, they at once ordered the arrest of WEBB, upon the charge of purloining public property. Capt. DOWLING found the accused in Broome-street, and demanded again, the restoration of the property; but WEBB refused to deliver it. Whereupon he was taken by force before the Commissioners, and afterwards committed to the cells. Justice BRENNAN held him to bail, yesterday, to appear before the Court of General Sessions. This is the first case of the kind which has occurred, and much feeling is manifested throughout the Department upon the subject. WEBB intends to contest the legality of his dismissal, and also the right of the Commissioners to compel the restoration of the property in question. The Commissioners are quite indignant at the course which WEBB has thought proper to pursue.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/063b9271-34af-5e0a-810a-1fb46d0a6dbc,501,nyt://article/063b9271-34af-5e0a-810a-1fb46d0a6dbc,

editorial lauds pending reforms,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/28/archives/the-morgan-agency.html,editorial lauds pending reforms,"It seemed right and eminently proper that the charge of Mr. Geo. D. MORGAN, of this City, of $70,000 to the Government for a few months' occasional service in purchasing steamers, sail vessels, &c., and its allowance by his brother-in-law, the Secretary of the Navy, should not be suffered to pass without further notice by Congress. Accordingly, we have a report from Mr. HALE, of the Senate Naval Committee, strongly condemnatory of the whole transaction, and insisting that the $70,000, unjustly taken by Mr. MORGAN, should be restored to the public Treasury, and a fair compensation or salary allowed to him as the agent of the Department, instead. It may be that Mr. MORGAN is beyond the reach of this persuasion to the right. Indeed, if, as we have heard intimated, he has already declined an opportunity to restore the money, afforded him by the Chairman or some member of the House Committee of Investigation before the publication of their report, we deem it quite probable that he will not surrender his more than questionable gains, now that all the facts, in their naked deformity, have been made public. Be this as it may, the question cannot be surrendered, in silence, as one of private conscience with Mr. MORGAN himself. He has deemed it proper to come before the public in a labored defence of the head of the Navy Department, who threw this $70,000 in his way, and incidentally, in his own justification, for clutching it. The shallow reasoning of his letter might pass for the little that it is intrinsically worth, but for the circumstance of the country and family relationship which surround the whole transaction, and the indignity to the common intelligence of the public, and especially of a commercial public like that of New-York, by the use of such logic.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Morgan Agency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Morgan Agency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Postal Service', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-01-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78bab2a6-43a8-5215-8cd2-ae6e9e73a899,1060,nyt://article/78bab2a6-43a8-5215-8cd2-ae6e9e73a899,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/28/archives/brooklyn-news-formal-opening-of-the-brooklyn-and-newtown-railroad.html,,"The Brooklyn and Newtown Railroad was formally opened yesterday to Broadway -- the Directors inaugurating their enterprise by giving free rides to all why chose to avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the road, and also gave a special entertainment to the authorities, distinguished citizens, members of the Hress and representatives of the other railroad interests in the city. The route thus completed commences at Fulton Ferry, the cars passing through Front-street, Gold-street, Willoughby-street, Debevoise-street and De Kalb-avenue to Stuyvesant-avenue, one block from Broadway, a distance of four and one-fourth miles. The Company obtained right of way from the City through Water-street, but as there is some difficulty with the Coney Island Railroad Company, which has also a right of running on the same street, between Fulton and Main streets, and the latter Company having obtained an injunction restraining the Newtown Company from using that street, that route will not be operated for the present. The new road passes for the most part through a populous portion of the city, and affords facilities for teaching a large section of the city heretofore unimproved for the want of just such facilities as this road affords. Fifteen new cars of the Albany pattern, containing all modern improvements and weighing only 3,000 pounds -- 1,000 pounds less than any other car in use -- have been placed on the road, and eighteen more will be added as soon as they can be completed. The road will be completed to Newtown -- nine miles -- early next Spring, and will thus open up for improvement a [???] of unimproved property. The officers of the Company are well-known and substantial citizens -- men who have had large experience in Brooklyn affairs, and who will take pride in endeavoring to make the interests of the public identical with those of the stockholders. At 1 1/2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the invited guests assembled at the office of the Company, [???] of Front and Dock streets, where they took cars and passed over the route. The citizens resident on the line of the route manifested their satisfaction at the consummation of this enterprise by displaying the National banner at different points. Near Stuyvesant-avenue, the Company will have erected, as soon as the weather permits, a brick stable, 200 feet square, and two stories high, with accommodations for 330 [???], at an expense of $36,000. The guests, after viewing the present ferment of the Railroad, were reseated in the cars, and returned to the place of starting, where they partook of a substantial collation, to which ample justice was done. Toasts to the President of the Company, and the success of the enterprise, to the Press, &c., were drunk, and elicited appropriate responses; and at a late hour the company dispersed, much pleased with all that they had seen and heard.

The stormy weather which it was known to have met almost. from the time of its departure, conjoined with the traditional dangers of navigation off the North Carolina coast, below Hatteras, was well calculated to excite gloomy fears for the safety of the Expedition.

In fact, had there been any wind blowing, the whole property on this wharf would have been endangered, owing to its position and the small space -- only some twenty feet in front, on the wharf, in which the firemen had to operate their machines. To these difficulties may be added that of defective hose. When the firemen did reach the scene of conflagration, they were seriously impeded in their operations by the constant bursting of the hose. The Chief Engineer of the Fire Department a long time ago applied to the Common Council for a supply of hose -- stating that the hose on hand was of a poor quality and nearly worn out. Through this neglect alone several thousand dollars worth of property was sacrificed at this fire.

This formal expression of opinion by the official French journal gives a character of generality to the question, and though it is not likely to become a matter of negotiation -- being without the province of diplomacy -- the stone blockade is, it must be owned, not ill-fitted to raise a clamor in the journals; and late experience has shown us that such popular clamor cannot be altogether ignored.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A WAY OF DISPENSING WITH STONE BLOCK.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A WAY OF DISPENSING WITH STONE BLOCK.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2dcd0b9b-7a9e-55c1-90b9-002ac976669e,444,nyt://article/2dcd0b9b-7a9e-55c1-90b9-002ac976669e,

No other New-York journal was able to publish anything beyond the meagre, inaccurate and contradictory dispatches to the Associated Press. The official dispatches from Washington erred by underrating the extent of the disaster which befell our fleet -- representing but one vessel as having been lost. On the other hand, the unofficial dispatch from Fortress Monroe sinned far worse on the other side, by grossly exaggerating the extent of our losses. It spoke of ""unknown schooners"" going down with many of those on board, threw out dark hints of treachery on the part of the pilots, in consequence of which many of the vessels were stranded, and both in what was stated and in what was left to be inferred, managed to convey a most distressing impression of disaster and defeat. The result was, that these vague hints of woe carried the most poignant distress to the hearts of the thousands who had those near and dear to them on board the fleet. But the minute and accurate statement, filling over a page of yesterday's TIMES, put an end to all this anxiety and suspense. We were able to state definitely what were our losses and what were the circumstances, and what was the true nature of the stops and hindrances met with. The consequence was that the fearful apprehensions excited by the unofficial dispatch -- and which were rather heightened than otherwise by the obvious and ominous suppressions of the official account -- gave way to a definite realization of the true state of the matter. And this was such as to inspire the best hopes of success for the Burnside Expedition.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Burnside Expedition Our Hatteras Inlet Correspondence.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Burnside Expedition Our Hatteras Inlet Correspondence.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/657f3b40-4e48-5b56-a32f-cd0a9b2bf139,311,nyt://article/657f3b40-4e48-5b56-a32f-cd0a9b2bf139,

Yet, if we will but honestly recall the numberless bad performances that have taken place during Mr. MARETZEK's absence, and remember, too, that art has steadily retrograded since he abandoned the field to less competent, but far noisier competitors, it will be conceded that there was nothing more than a graceful recognition of positive merit in the hearty applause which greeted that gentleman on his appearance in the orchestra last night. And the opera went so smoothly, and with so much spirit, that a blind man might have known a new chief was at the head of the musical forces. Mr. MARETZEK possesses qualities that cannot be exaggerated. He is one of the best on chestral accompanists that we have ever had, and can nurse a voice to the absolute development of all its strength. This purely Italian faculty is blended with a broad, massive German sense of effect, and the combination, even under the most unfavorable circumstances, produces what is called a fine performance. There are men, who, with innumerable rehearsals, can arrive at the same results, but we know of none that can infuse a spirit of completeness into a representation that has had but little preparation, so well as he.

Editorial urges speedy capture of Confederate Gen.

Price in Missouri because of his strategy in border warfare,"What the Sumter is on seas, Gen. PRICE is on the land -- everywhere present, yet never to be caught. Now he is up on the Missouri River, now on the Osage, and now away down among the Ozark hills; anon he skirts along the Kansas border, skulks down into Arkansas, or rushes toward the red man's reserve; now he turns his front toward St. Louis, and again, no man but himself can tell of his whereabouts. The military ""traps"" in which he is to be caught, he adroitly evades; the military sacks in which he is to be ""bagged,"" he carefully keeps away from; and even the great military ""anaconda"" cannot get a chance of bringing him within its coils. Yet, both the pirate PRICE and the pirate Sumter must be caught, and that speedily. We want two heroes -- a naval hero to catch the sea-pirate, and a military hero to catch the land-pirate; and we promise that both heroes, when their work is done, shall be crowned with such honors and glory as will reverse forever the false old saw, that republics are ungrateful.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Third Pursuit of Price.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Third Pursuit of Price.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b0117ef6-b9b0-5ecf-aa67-c592db873a61,709,nyt://article/b0117ef6-b9b0-5ecf-aa67-c592db873a61,
