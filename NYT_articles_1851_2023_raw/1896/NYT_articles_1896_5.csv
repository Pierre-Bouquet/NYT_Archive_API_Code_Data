"From Blackwood's Magazine. Our liquor costs 40,000,000 of us several hundred millions a year; while 50,000 chests of opium at u100 a piece, and 200,000 chests at u50 apiece, would only make u15,000,000 a year among 4000,000,000 people. Opium smoking causes no violence, incites no crime, unless, perhaps, it be to stealing the means for a smoke.
