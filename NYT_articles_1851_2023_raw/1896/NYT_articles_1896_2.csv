"""The Countess Gucki"" has so taken the fancy of the public at Daly's that the revival of ""Henry IV.,"" with Miss Rehan as Prince Hal, will be deferred. Schonthan's new comedy of life at Carlsbad in the first quarter of this century is dainty and diverting in a natural and unaffected way. It is devoid of farce and caricature, its simple plot is well developed, and its characters are understandable and interesting.

"In the last report of the Superintendent, the decided impl? in the balance in the financial result was noted. A similar result was attained in the last year. The expenditures Por care and maintenance were in 1594 $465,2G9; for 1S95 they were $46i,209. As the daily  of prisoners in 189o ivas 97 greater than 1596, it is clear that very rigid economy was practiced in the latter year.  he net. industry earnings in 189v exceeded those in 1594. In 1591 the total sum credited to earnings was $t)9,197; in 1595 the sum of $135,ISI was so credited. It is b3?this increase of net earnings that the  of 1S93 is reduced. Tables are presented showing that. the earnings of the convicts in the three prisons for the six years-1SS9 to 1S95-amounted to $1,302,420. The prisons returned to the State Trea.s ury or expended by direction of the Legis lature all the money that it originally re ceived from the State. far industrial pur poses, and $94,635 in addition; that the prisons paid to convicts $52,775; that the prisons on Sept. 31, 15:75, had cash in banks amounting to $314,441, and had industrial assets on hand valued at $SIO,616. In .the course of his report, the Superintendent aa3?s:  The-h ealth of the convicts fn the last )'ear was eery?good. The death rate of 1895 was the low est that it has be,n fur several years. In pre serving the health op the prisoners at Sing Slng and Auburn Prisons some clear disadvantages have: to be overcome,  ?hich can be removed only by ne?v construction in order to obtain cell ac  op the proper kind and to afford better ventilation and sanitation. The Practical importance and (al value of this change have been recognized for many years. The need op such change .has been enforced in the last three  by the evidence Purnishetl in flue re ports--oP the physicians of the prevalence op             disorders and op the great mortality W  arises in the prisons from that cause.  prisoners who have fitness for some one of them fof ? such .  that is not permitted, the demand is still imperative that prisoners shall be kept at wont. The de mand arises from their condition, and must con tinue. In the prison system   which is--now in operation, the convicts participate in the earnings of the prisons as compensation for theft labor. Their share !s not to exceed 10 per cent. op the  of the prison fn  ?.hich th=y are     3ned. The effect of this, provision has been that the  'ardens of the three State prisons have paid to convicts in cash, since 1889, the sum op $82,775.17. 'this money has been op very positive benefit to the men who have completed their Terms op imprisonment.

This rumor was then published in TxE NEw-YORK Tla>IES. Confirmation oP it has been had to-day?. It is said that llr. Platt proposes to continue the sub-com? mittee for the entire year, and to give into its charge the various bills Svhich will carry out the union of the various municipalities. This committee will represent Mr. Plate and the question arises whether it or the commission of fifteen which the bill calls for will be the paramount body. As the Platt legislators regard it, the subcom mittee wlll be the real actual construction agent. The nine Commissioners to be ap? pointed by the Governor ara expected to be eminently respectable, dignified, and intelli gent men. Gov. Morton will be expected tc designate such, and thereby he will         himself of any charge of putting this im? portant work into the hands of politicians.

"Ivlr. [Chanter]'s first expedition was in the shallow waters of Lake Jipe, on a raft made of palm stems. His object was to get a shot at the hippos. As he left his African followers on the shore, they showed their appreciation by shouting these cheering words: "" Loolt out Eor crocodiles! If mas ter dies, who ll pay us? "" There were many hippos-"" the surface oP the lake dotted here and there by spots, which soon re solved themselves into the black, boxlike heads of my game."" The huge beasts seemed quite indifferent at the approach of the strange craft. A group of five hippos n^as approached to  1'a0 yards; then, with a snort, they faced the raft. The rafts men seemed to have lost  3Ir. Chanter to stake a retreat, but he urged the crew until within 100 yards, when lie fired at the nearest animal; he missed, and then all oP the hippos disappeared. 1~'hen the sun rose, he counted fifty hippos, and talc(ng a good sight at ti. nearest one, he fired, and knew the bullet had reached its mark. He fancied that he would bag that hippo. but it sank out oP sight.  Tr Cltan ler writes: ""I had not 3 et learned that the brain of these animals is very small, and that the only fatal shot is under the ear."" Then the hippos seemed to have crowded him, for they were decidedly too near for comfort. Next, "" slowly but steadily.,"" 1\ir. Chanter felt that the frail raft was being lifted up. The boatmen yelled with terror. Evidently the hippo found he had made a mistake, and he left the bottom oP the raft. Ilr. Chanter had shot at three hippos and no dead animal was visible.  Anything more disagreeable and danger ous than a hunt for buffalo in its own cov ert can hardly be imagined. The brush is not more than ten feet high, and through this the animals have made runways in numerable-but the branches meet at a man s shoulders. These paths cross and Cem oss in a labyrinthian way. Get caught In one o: these paths of a charging buf falo, and there can be no escape. Into just such an ugly brush as this llr. Chanter en tered, and there was a charge of buffaloes, but they passed on, separating just at the place where stood . Chanter. Then the  follower said: "" Ham del Allah ""=' Praise be to God""-and our sportsman says lie "" began to underst;tnd m hy buffalo shooting in the brush has been always considered unsafe.""  Mr. [Theodore Roosevelt]'s latest hunting experiences, in 1S93 and 189f, are neatly told. Antelope, where they once abounded, not far from his ranch, are by no means as abm:dant as they were. The only increase in the region of the Little \Iissourt has been in the wolves. Blaclctail at e not, how ever, diminishing. TVhere twenty were killed a dozen years ago for every one whitetail, now their numbers are about the same. The prong horn is getting scarcer, and so is the buffalo.elk. As to his battery, Mr.=Roosevelt has always been singular in his adhesion to the `Virichester, and he uses a .45-90. As to penetration, perhaps more stress is laid on that than it actually de serves. "" Shock is useless if it is gained at too ,great expense of penetration or ac curacy."" You may get flatness of  tory, but IP you are not accurate there is little use in it. ~'e are rather conservative, and having been brought up in the school of the ancient small bore, with a long and solid bullet, and a fair charge of powder, :ye rather hang to that than to big bores, extra heavy powder, and hollow bullets. The l7 believes more in a double-barreled rifle.  T'e put our faith in a repeating arm. "" Each type has some good qualities' that the other lacks, and each has some defects."" Then 1\Ir. Theo dore Roosevelt takes pleasure in noting what is Ilr. Selous's favorite arm. It is a rifle close to the type of that used by, us twenty-five years ago, of .45-calibre, with is grains of powder and a .bullet of 3u0 grains. blr, Roosevelt believes that we will even adopt a smaller calibre-one of .25G to .310-with 40 grains of powder, and a 200-grain bullet, But then the powder used to-day is a stronger substance than it was in former days.
